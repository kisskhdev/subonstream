WEBVTT

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.399
Yes.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.799
Boss.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.280
The joint getting shut down is a big deal.

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.079
How does Lang Jiu plan to fix this?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.959
Brother Jiu said...

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:07.239
he plans to...

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:09.359
take some men to sign that influencer, Lin Lu.

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:10.519
And while he's at it,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.400
deal with that delivery guy.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.480
Let's go.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's go join the fun.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.480
If you want to see Wei Wei,

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.599
come immediately.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.719
What are you screaming for?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.759
Come on, aren't you supposed to be tough?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.199
Didn't you hang up on me?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.439
Let go of me!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.840
What are you doing?

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:21.800
You're so pretty,

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:25.120
and have such a nice body.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.960
What do you think we're going to do?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.800
Hold her down.

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.520
Yes.

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.159
Don't touch me!

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.919
I...

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.520
Don't hurt her face.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.599
Her face...

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.800
is worth more than your life.

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.840
Let go of me!

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.360
Let me out!

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.439
So annoying.

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:49.840
Tape her mouth shut.

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.360
Yes.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.680
Alright.

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:41.080
I'm tired of playing anyway.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.199
Make her sign the contract.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.719
Hurry up.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.840
Press it.

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.000
Why is it you again?

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.960
What?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.000
Are you surprised it's me?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.240
Where is Wei Wei?

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:17.439
As expected.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:18.480
This trick...

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.240
works really well on you.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.519
You scum.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:27.639
You only use these despicable methods.

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.959
Let her go.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.759
Just because you say so?

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:33.000
Wouldn't I lose face then?

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:36.879
Get him.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:44.759
Kneel down.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.240
Kneel!

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:11.199
On both knees.

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:25.199
Didn't you look down on me back then?

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:26.920
Didn't you think I was beneath you?

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:28.160
Who would have thought...

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.240
that the once...

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.279
glorious Triple Crown Champion, Cheng Ye,

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:33.319
would be kneeling right in front of me.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.800
You must know him, right?

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.759
This guy...

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:44.480
was a legend in the billiards world back then.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.600
Cheng Ye.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.120
Just because of one match,

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.519
he couldn't even save his girlfriend from a tragic death.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:56.839
Later...

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:57.759
later he won a...

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.360
fake championship.

00:05:59.519 --> 00:06:01.120
And then he got kicked out of the billiards world.

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:03.759
Look at him now.

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:05.839
He's just a delivery guy.

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:25.800
The Super Power Cup...

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.079
National Youth Billiards Championship winner is...

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.639
Cheng Ye!

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.360
Cheng Ye

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.000
Back when you refused to work with Boss Nan

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.560
you were so arrogant you looked down on everyone

00:06:50.079 --> 00:06:50.800
Now

00:06:52.079 --> 00:06:52.959
I want you to admit

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.839
I want you to admit with your own mouth

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:55.800
that you lost

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.079
that you are a complete and utter loser

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.240
Isn't your target just me?

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:02.959
Let her go first

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.800
Don't think so highly of yourself

00:07:09.399 --> 00:07:10.399
My target

00:07:11.079 --> 00:07:11.879
isn't you

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:13.720
However

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.879
since you like meddling so much

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.399
I can actually give you a

00:07:17.399 --> 00:07:19.000
chance to play the hero saving the beauty

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:23.720
Before

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.639
everyone said your reaction speed was fast

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.199
and unmatched

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.519
So let's play a reaction game

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:30.720
If you win

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.839
I'll let you go

00:07:32.279 --> 00:07:33.000
If you lose

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.360
you both

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.560
stay here

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:46.439
Three chances

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.000
Whoever catches more wins

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:50.839
If you can't catch it

00:07:59.199 --> 00:07:59.879
I'll play with you

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.360
Don't drag her into this

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.079
You're not qualified to negotiate with me

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.439
understand?

00:08:12.519 --> 00:08:12.959
You

00:08:13.839 --> 00:08:15.360
We won't use balls

00:08:16.439 --> 00:08:17.160
We'll use this

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.480
It's up to you whether to play

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.279
If you don't

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:28.199
I'll carve up her face right now

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.799
What's wrong?

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.799
Scared?

00:08:38.759 --> 00:08:40.399
If you're scared, you can just admit defeat

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.279
You already admitted defeat earlier anyway

00:08:58.480 --> 00:08:59.480
Within thirty seconds

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.600
if he still doesn't let go

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.320
chop off one of Lin Lu's fingers

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:05.799
You got it, Brother Jiu

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:31.159
You are truly despicable

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:31.919
Hei Ba

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.559
Changing positions at will is a foul

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.720
For a grand champion like you

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.679
doing this isn't appropriate, is it?

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:39.600
This time doesn't count

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.039
If you dare play tricks again

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.480
don't blame me for being ruthless

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:16.399
do you still dare to let go?

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:37.679
Let go

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.399
As long as this time

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.279
I don't catch it

00:10:41.679 --> 00:10:42.759
you win

00:10:44.279 --> 00:10:45.080
You

00:10:47.919 --> 00:10:48.879
can

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.919
leave
