[Too Young To Love]

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.100
[Episode 4]

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.400
How's your cello practice
been going lately?

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.280
It's okay.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.680
"Okay" isn't good enough.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.940
You need to be the best.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.200
Only by getting first place

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.680
will people remember you.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.410
Understand?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.480
Mm.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.200
Ning...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.200
Never mind, nothing.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.470
Go on practicing.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:27.590
Let's go, Lan!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.430
I'm so envious.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.120
If only I could

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.680
bring my own cello to perform.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.280
Just borrow one from them later.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.940
They shouldn't be that petty.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.960
Then you can go up

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.840
and play with them.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.680
No way.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.840
Instruments are
precious personal belongings.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.360
We don't lend them out lightly.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.000
Forget it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I'll just listen.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.000
Sir,

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.150
excuse me.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.010
That girl over there...

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.710
I...

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.220
I'll go get the coffee.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.000
Thanks.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.079
Come on.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:57.680
M... Me?

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.360
Come on.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.870
Can I?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.710
Thank you.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.450
You've got this.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.840
What piece do you want to play, miss?

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.590
The Concerto for Two Cellos?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.590
Of course.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.920
Aren't you usually the levelheaded one?

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.040
Why didn't you explain it clearly
to our daughter?

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.160
Don't you know what kind of temper

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.420
your own daughter has?

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.720
She's just like you—
proud and high-spirited

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720
since childhood.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.750
Now

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.250
you're going to tell her

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.160
the company went bankrupt
and we're in debt?

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.960
You want me to just tell her that?

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.159
Fine.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.120
Studying abroad is a major step in life.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.720
Before Ning goes abroad,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.320
I'll have the tuition ready.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.240
No matter what,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.520
Ning's future can't be delayed.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.950
She is our only daughter

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.360
and all our hope.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.040
She must attend

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.370
the best music conservatory in the world!

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.220
[Reborn! We Got This]

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:33.159
That was amazing.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:36.750
I have a call.

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:38.070
Hello?

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.190
Ning.

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.510
I just saw the video Mengmeng

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.920
shared in the group chat.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.190
You looked quite happy

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.360
playing the cello.

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.390
What's wrong?

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:50.510
Your voice sounds a little strange.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.360
It's nothing.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.390
You can tell me, you know.

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.750
In the future, if you're unhappy,

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.150
you can always talk to me.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.270
I'll keep all your secrets.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:03.950
Then let me ask you—

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.160
if one day

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.070
you face

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.160
a huge setback,

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.160
what would you do?

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.040
A huge setback...

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.950
I once read that

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.720
if fate

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.190
wants to give you

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:23.590
a really wonderful gift,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.970
it will first push you to the brink—

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.600
so you'll be strong enough to catch it.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.510
When things hit rock bottom,
they turn around—

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.570
every dark night ends at dawn, right?

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.600
The brink...

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:43.920
If that gift really exists,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.830
I hope that one day

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.830
I'll play the cello on the greatest stage

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.720
in the world.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:56.390
Me too.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.360
Right now,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.600
I'm 100% sure

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.170
that I love playing the cello.

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:06.830
Then let's

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:08.160
never give up.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:09.890
Let's always

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.850
love playing the cello, okay?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.600
Okay.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.000
I believe in you.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.550
Thank you.

How big is it altogether?

I've never thought about it.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.360
Maybe two or three thousand square meters.

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.480
That big?

the hardest part of a barbecue

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:03.200
is getting the fire started.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.400
But I have already...

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.480
got it started.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.720
Amazing, so amazing.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.080
So when can we eat?

Relax.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.180
Xiaole,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.870
bring the oil and skewers over.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:31.080
I'm about to start grilling them.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.480
Okay.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.360
The oil...

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.960
For that, we've gotta ask
Tong Xiaole to do it.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.840
He lies through his teeth all the time.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.970
He's basically a walking greaseball.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.370
What's wrong, greaseball?

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.410
Where's the oil?

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.600
Isn't the oil right here?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.670
Are you sure
you've got the grilling covered,

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.200
Mr. Chen?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.480
Leave it to me.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.080
Mr. Chen,

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:07.960
between day and night is too huge.

You're being picky now?

Chen Fan, do you need help?

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.360
Sure. Help me grab

I picked them from the hill
behind our house.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.200
I love mushrooms.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.080
Picked from the back hill...

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.940
They're not poisonous, are they?

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.550
Let me see.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.840
Do you remember

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.080
my dad teaching us

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.080
how to

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.490
identify mushrooms when we were kids?

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.600
This kind...

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.840
should be edible, right?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.200
I don't remember.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.920
It should be edible!

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.720
Should be shiitake.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.320
That's right.

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.200
Just eat without worry.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.360
Then I'm going to pig out later.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.720
Help me grill the mushrooms.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.480
Okay.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.080
These are done, right?

00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:58.960
Yes, yes, yes.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.670
Smells so good!

Yi Lan,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.080
don't you like mushrooms?

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.840
There's mushroom soup here.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.480
Have some?

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.200
Okay.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.240
Is it ready?

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.870
Ready.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.670
Thanks.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.200
Here.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.360
Here.

Thanks.

Which idiot picked this "perfect" day?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.840
Unbelievable.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.320
You picked it!

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:38.790
You did!

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.240
You did!

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:39.790
You did!

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:40.320
You did!

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.080
Whoever picked it is an idiot!

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:41.840
I picked it.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.000
Well, I think rainy days are kind of nice.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:58.480
What else

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.480
can we do on a rainy day?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.200
I'm going to shower first.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.400
Don't fight me for it!

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.980
The barbecue was soaked through.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.790
I'll go check

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.590
if there's anything else to eat.

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.960
I'm going to charge my phone.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.130
He took so many photos of me.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.670
You took all those photos of me

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:08.330
and won't even let me see them?

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.590
Didn't the battery die just now?

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.600
Give it to me.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.360
I haven't picked a profile picture yet.

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.870
Didn't you come up to find food?

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:18.800
Did you find any?

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:19.480
Not yet.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.000
Then let me see the photos first!

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.730
I remember Chen Fan's place
has some down here...

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.660
There's food here!

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:31.550
Let me see!

00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:32.000
Look over there!

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:32.660
There's...

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.390
W-Why did it go dark?

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:41.800
Did the power go out?

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.480
The power's out?

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:47.840
Where is Mengmeng?

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:48.440
Mengmeng!

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.200
Lan!

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:49.800
Mengmeng!

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:51.200
Lan, Lan,

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.670
I'm scared to be alone,

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.240
Lan!

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.320
You grabbed the wrong person.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.200
I'm here.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.080
Lan.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:58.080
I'm scared too.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:58.960
What should we do now?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.820
How about this—

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:00.960
you two wait here.

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.810
I'll go down and check.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.480
Don't go! Don't go!

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.440
Xiaole!

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.730
Then... let's slowly feel our way out.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.320
Why is it so dark?

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.640
Probably a power outage.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.320
Why is it raining?

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:24.870
Wasn't it already raining just now?

00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:26.080
I'm so dizzy!

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:26.720
It's the lightning.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.780
Thunder and rain are totally normal.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.240
The Water Curtain Cave.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:32.600
Water Curtain Cave!

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.790
There's a horse!

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:40.390
It's fake.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.120
Horse.

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.480
Horse.

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.120
Horse.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.690
Stop imagining things.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.720
We live in a scientific world, okay?

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.440
Stick to materialism, alright?

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.240
Materialism.

00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:54.630
Who? Who did that?

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.670
Chen Fan,

00:15:55.670 --> 00:15:56.790
can you not pop out like that?

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:57.720
You scared us half to death!

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.030
Chen Fan!

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.480
I'm scared to be alone.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.740
Let's stick together.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.120
W-What's wrong?

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.870
It looked like a figure over there!

00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:08.670
There was a figure?

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:09.600
Where?

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.240
Bro,

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.440
that's your face-shaped sofa!

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:14.200
Unbelievable.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.090
Where is your circuit breaker?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:17.670
By the door.

00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:18.720
Go flip the switch, hurry.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.480
You're brave.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.080
-You go!
-You go!

00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:22.320
Of course I can go!

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.000
But if I go,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.200
who will protect you?

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.720
This is your house!

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.650
You want me to go?

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.170
Don't worry!

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:29.200
I'll protect you!

00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:30.840
Let's do this—

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.480
Yi Lan, you on my left,

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:33.480
and Qiao Mengmeng, you on my right.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.940
I-I'll stand on your left.

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:38.240
Let's go together.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.200
Wait a second!

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.840
Isn't this formation just protecting you?

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.440
I figured

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.840
if anything happens to any of you,

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.000
I can rush to your rescue

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.080
immediately!

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.480
Coward!

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.080
Alright!

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.440
Let's move!

00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.080
Let's go!

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:57.470
Open the door.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.060
Open the door.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:16:58.530
Open the door.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:16:59.330
Open the door.

00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:12.480
I still haven't achieved my dreams!

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.589
I'm too young to die!

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.829
Help!

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.240
It sounds like someone's knocking.

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.440
Go check it out!

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.030
It's a person knocking!

00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:27.069
A person knocking!

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:28.160
Knocking on the door!

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.070
Only humans can knock on something, right?

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.240
You go!

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.350
Come on, let's go!

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:33.110
If I go,

00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:34.310
who will protect you?

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:35.920
Hurry up! Come on!

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:40.440
Hurry!

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.240
I don't want to!

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:48.110
Wait!

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:52.310
You go!

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:53.160
Y-You go!

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.020
Hurry up and go!

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.000
I'm going then.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:17:59.440
Go.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:16.110
Y-You can do it.

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:32.110
See? No one's there!

00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.350
I'm Zhao Zhenghao!

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:40.360
It's me, Zhao Zhenghao!

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.350
Zhao Zhenghao?

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.440
Xiaole! Xiaole!

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:45.270
Well, I think he's

00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:46.440
Zhao Zhenghao!

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.400
Zhao Zhenghao?

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.550
Zhao Zhenghao?

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:06.330
Finally warming up.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:08.920
Xiaole.

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.960
You hit me way too hard.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680
Sorry about that.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.350
I trained at the Shaolin Temple as a kid.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:16.070
That was

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:18.000
pure muscle memory.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.920
Then let's settle this man to man.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:22.400
Alright, that's enough.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.880
Don't ask for trouble.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.320
Tell us, why did you come?

00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:30.590
I invited him.

00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:33.310
I think you guys

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:35.790
might have had a tiny misunderstanding.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:39.030
Well, Zhao Zhenghao is pretty handsome.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.760
You can take this chance to
get to know him better.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.240
To find you guys...

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.510
Look at this heavy rain.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.270
I risked my life to come here.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.510
Shouldn't you welcome me?

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.270
We're hungry and sleepy.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.530
How can we welcome you?

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.110
I'm hungry too.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:59.040
I haven't eaten anything tonight.

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.920
Where are you going?

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.070
Zhao Zhenghao!

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.920
The barbecue outside

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.320
is all soaked by the rain.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.680
We can't eat it anymore!

00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:20.070
Look, let's share.

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.890
Zhao Zhenghao, you're so nice.

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.240
In such heavy rain,

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:25.240
you still came all this way to find us.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.550
Zhao Zhenghao, I didn't expect

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:28.150
you to be such a loyal friend.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.160
How did I not notice before?

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.030
Exactly.

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:33.160
Zhao Zhenghao, you're handsome and loyal.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.550
We should get to know him better.

00:20:34.550 --> 00:20:36.000
You might not know me well.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.200
I'm a really nice guy.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.560
We can start getting to
know each other now.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:44.640
I feel so sleepy.

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:45.720
What?

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:47.960
I just got here, and you're sleepy?

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:49.350
Get up and party!

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:53.830
I've got to hand it to you.

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.920
After coming all this way,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.920
how do you still have so much energy?

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:58.310
Do you think

00:20:59.110 --> 00:21:00.550
the mushrooms we just ate

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.830
are okay?

00:21:04.550 --> 00:21:06.010
You said they were edible.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:07.880
I told you they were poisonous.

00:21:11.790 --> 00:21:13.790
Hear me well:

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:15.400
to prevent

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.070
any further accidents,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.750
I suggest

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.830
that we go to sleep right now.

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:24.440
Hello, Dad.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.110
I ate something bad last night.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:28.070
What did you eat?

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.880
Mushrooms.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.510
How could you be so careless?

00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:31.720
I ate the most.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.980
What are you doing?

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:35.000
Xiaole is here!

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.680
Look.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.680
Hello, Uncle Dong.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.350
Hello, Xiaole.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:38.070
We're all together.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.070
Don't worry.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.110
It's beautiful here.

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:42.240
Look.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.230
The environment is nice.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.600
The weather is great today.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.750
Have fun then.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.370
What are you doing?

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.550
Mom, I'm fine.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:56.350
I'm safe.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:57.350
Come back soon.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:58.480
I'll be back very soon.

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.070
Come on, come on!

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.270
Breakfast is here!

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.270
Xiaole,

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:02.200
come on.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.030
Xiaole.

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:04.750
Where is my son?

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.200
Chen Fan? Chen Fan!

00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:10.680
Here! Coming!

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:11.400
Come on!

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.160
Breakfast is ready!

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.510
Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.550
Honestly, you kids...

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:18.440
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.240
I would've come over last night
if I'd known!

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.310
Come on.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:23.270
Fan, have a fried dough stick.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.640
This is for you.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:29.270
Here, for you two.

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:30.880
Thank you, Auntie.

00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:34.790
Who hasn't got one? Here.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:35.350
Stop talking.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:36.240
Just eat.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.640
You must be starving.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:43.440
There are more fried dough sticks.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.240
So sweet.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.270
Not happy?

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.240
No.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:13.310
The last piece of nougat.

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.040
I'll give it to you—make a wish.

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:20.110
Thanks.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.350
Look!

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:24.650
There's a rainbow!

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.640
Look, look!

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:27.160
Do you see it?

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.270
Where?

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:30.830
Only happy people

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:32.110
can see it.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.640
No wonder then.

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.830
Do you remember

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:39.750
that song we sang in kindergarten,

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.440
"Come On"?

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.350
The song the teacher kept making you sing

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:44.350
as punishment
for causing trouble in class?

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.070
It was obviously you
who always pulled my pigtails

00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.470
and got punished to sing.

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.030
Don't think that
just because you have good grades now,

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:49.680
nobody remembers

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.830
what you were like as a kid.

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:51.830
Don't slander me.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:52.830
Talk is cheap.

00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:53.960
Where's your proof?

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.030
Hello there. Come on.

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:57.550
Wait for me!

00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.880
Happiness

00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.920
is waiting for everyone ahead!

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:01.590
Let go of me!

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:02.350
Hello there.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:03.240
Come on!

00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.400
This is so embarrassing!

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.110
Let go of me!

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:06.400
Don't run!

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.060
Dance by yourself if you want!

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:11.190
I'm feeling much better now.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.400
You really shouldn't

00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:15.600
participate in such activities again.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:17.880
If something like that happens again,

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.160
call Dad immediately.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.750
Dad will come over right away

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:22.590
to protect you.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:23.240
Alright, alright,

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.100
that's enough.

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:24.790
Lan,

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:26.030
have some hot soup, quickly.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:26.680
Okay.

Braised chicken.

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.070
It's still hot.

00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:15.070
Eat up.

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.160
I'll put this container
in the fridge for you.

00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:17.440
Okay.

Heat it up yourself when you're hungry.
