Your Highness, why are you...

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.190
I was looking for my secret guards.

Rather than die together,

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:23.450
I revealed my true identity to Mr. Bei

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.240
and had him leave first.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.490
Mr. Bei treated us so well.

Once we reclaim the capital,

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.150

and training at the same time.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.510
By now, you all should fully understand

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.440
the might of this sleeve crossbow.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.200
But now that we've reached the capital,

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.250
you don't know exactly
who it's meant to be aimed at.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.930
You've probably already guessed—

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:20.230
this weapon

00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:22.090
is meant for a rebellion!

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:23.350
That's right.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.720
But it's a rebellion for the right cause,

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.320
aimed against the traitors.

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:31.720
I, Lin Xuanying,
Deputy General of the Right Army!

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.200
I, Shen Xiao,
Commandant of the Right Army!

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:34.840
I, Chi Yulin,
Colonel of the Right Army!

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.000
I, Hulan Zhe'er, General of the Household
of the Right Army!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.200
Pay our respects to Your Majesty

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.480
and Your Majesty the Empress!

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.210
His Majesty?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.360
His Majesty is still alive?

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.760
It's His Majesty indeed.

00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:45.910
When I returned to the capital
with General You to report our duties,

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:47.440
I saw him in the palace hall.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.150
Then why did Prince Duan say
His Majesty had...

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.460
Congratulations, everyone.

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:54.200
You're about to earn the merit of
restoring the throne!

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.750
Greetings, Your Majesty!
Greetings, Your Majesty the Empress!

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.240
No need for formalities, gentlemen.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.170
-Thank you, Your Majesty!
-Thank you, Your Majesty!

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:10.670
This weapon

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:13.730
was made by an old friend of mine.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:16.600
Originally,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.440
he only hoped it could

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.950
keep me safe.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.200
Today,

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.360
I place this in your hands

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.100
not in the hope of seizing power

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:29.840
or reclaiming the throne,

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:30.900
but in the hope that

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.720
you can use it to safeguard our realm,

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.780
protect our state,

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.240
and ensure the safety of the people!

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.390
This is the medicine prescribed by
Physician Xiao.

00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:17.320
How is Cen doing?

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:18.160
Not well.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.240
He can't even get out of bed anymore.

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.630
Don't let it show later.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:22.410
Okay.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.080
Come on in.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:24.600
Put on a smile.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.440
I'm back.

00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.480
I bought some live fish.

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.920
I'll make you fish soup later

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.780
to help you regain your strength.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.600
Cen.

00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:49.960
Was my divination accurate or not?

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.760
I said it would snow today.

00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.510
And it's

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.270
indeed snowing outside.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:56.810
Here.

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:59.480
Then it was actually a pity

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.280
that you were transferred out of

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.300
the Imperial Observatory, Yang.

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:05.630
You can even joke now.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.780
Are you almost recovered?

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.170
Enough with the jokes.

00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.400
Yang meant well.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:17.600
I know

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.080
my condition.

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.810
No need to take it so seriously.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.260
Seriously though,

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.480
what's the situation outside?

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.200
Not good.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.510
We were right
not to return to our residences.

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.700
The ministers who knelt outside
His Majesty's chambers

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:44.360
have been trapped in their own residences
by the Imperial Guards

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.960
and are not allowed to leave.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:48.340
His Majesty was prescient.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:49.850
This hideout

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.550
he prepared for us back then

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:52.320
has now

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.780
become our refuge.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.080
What I'm worried about is that
given Prince Duan's methods,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.600
his men finding this place

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.050
is only a matter of time.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.000
Since things have come to this,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:04.910
we should plan ahead.

00:16:15.150 --> 00:16:15.960
At this point,

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.290
there are only two ways to survive:

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:21.170
either resign from office

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.840
or

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.410
pledge allegiance to Prince Duan.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.410
But from the looks of it,

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:29.560
you don't seem like the type

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.300
to pledge allegiance to Prince Duan.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:32.960
Of course.

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.240
I will never pledge allegiance.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.340
I'd rather spill my blood in the main hall

00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.600
and go down in history.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:37.320
True.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:39.720
I'm planning to resign.

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:42.030
Now there's no one left in the court

00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:43.810
worth my loyalty.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.470
I might as well

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.440
return home and take care of my parents.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.840
I'd actually like to
try pledging allegiance.

00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:55.320
Er Lan.

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.050
Now is not the time for jokes.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:58.290
I'm not joking.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.290
With His Majesty dead,

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.850
most royalists will choose to resign
to stay alive.

00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.240
There will be many vacancies in the court,

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.160
and Prince Duan will need people
to work for him.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.290
So in the short term,

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:11.680
he probably won't touch those who remain.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.900
Er, you're smarter than this.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:16.810
Even if he doesn't act now,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.160
how can we be sure Prince Duan
won't settle scores later?

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.880
Let's take it one step at a time.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.200
When that time really comes,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.800
dying then won't be too late.

00:17:25.589 --> 00:17:28.040
Compared to dying in a show of loyalty,

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.310
I think

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.550
His Majesty would perhaps prefer to see

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:34.120
us keeping the people safe

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.350
and not letting them
suffer from the turmoil.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.210
Er, there's no need to insinuate.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:39.830
I am now

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.830
no longer the hothead I was
when I first joined the court.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.560
Of course I understand
your good intentions, Er.

00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:47.310
It's just that

00:17:48.550 --> 00:17:49.610
at a time like this,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.960
pledging allegiance to
someone like Prince Duan

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.490
and bowing my head to him...

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:56.480
It would truly be a humiliation
beyond measure.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.310
As the saying goes,
when a mansion is about to collapse,

00:17:58.310 --> 00:18:00.770
the power of one person
is so insignificant.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:02.240
Life is short,

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.270
and Er, you are in the prime of your life.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:09.170
Why not live for yourself for once?

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.310
Cen, there's something you don't know.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.240
I'm staying

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.540
not only for the greater good,

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:28.310
but also for personal feelings.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:37.800
Wait a minute.

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.440
Personal feelings?

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.330
Which lady is it?

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.720
Have we met her?

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.310
It's his private matter.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.370
Why are you prying?

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:55.230
But Er isn't an outsider.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.150
Right.

00:18:56.550 --> 00:18:58.400
Right, he... He isn't an outsider.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:59.000
Indeed, he isn't an outsider.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.790
Since he isn't an outsider,

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:01.310
then let's not leave either.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.960
We can't let her be alone in the court,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.240
fighting a lone battle, right?

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.400
Didn't you just say you'd rather

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.830
spill your blood in the main hall
and go down in history?

00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:09.960
Why did you change your stance so fast?

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:12.400
I never changed, okay? I...

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.830
I do want to spill my blood
in the main hall.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.830
But since I want to spill my blood there,

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:18.440
I have to get to the main hall first,
right?

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.750
I can't spill my blood at...

00:19:19.750 --> 00:19:20.480
At the entrance, right?

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.640
You... Wait a second.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.920
W-What about me?

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.940
How dare you, Yang Duojie?

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:26.360
A-At a time like this,

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.730
everyone is sad.

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:31.440
What about me? Don't say another word.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.780
I originally wanted this fish...

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:04.350
Actually, it would be safer for you
to stay in Peiyang to hold the fort.

00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:06.200
After the turmoil in the city
settles down...

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:07.350
Don't even think about it.

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.680
I won't let you have your way
a second time.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.680
Don't you want

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:14.030
to travel the world anymore?

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.720
I do.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.350
The world is right there.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:19.350
It doesn't matter if I go a bit later.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.540
Come to think of it,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.400
we've only known each other
for a little over half a year,

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.000
yet so much has happened.

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:32.980
We've practically

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:35.160
gone through life and death together.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.860
However,

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:38.070
in a sense,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.860
it seems like we've only just met?

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.030
Yeah.

00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:45.880
After all, you don't even know
my name yet.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.300
I had my own worries back then,

00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.530
so I didn't dare to discuss this topic
with you in detail.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.190
So what is your real name?

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:55.650
My name is...

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.550
Don't you think the name Yu Wanyin
sounds really nice?

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.110
I do think Yu Wanyin sounds very nice.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.510
So what is your real name?

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.370
I...

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.860
I can tell you,

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:13.350
but you have to promise me one thing.

00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.950
What is it?

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:16.930
You can't laugh after I tell you.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.030
Why would I laugh?

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.650
Could it be funnier than Zhang San?

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.170
Wang Cuihua.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.680
For real?

00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.560
Your real name is Wang Cuihua?

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.620
Wang Cuihua...

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.210
"Cuihua,

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:52.390
serve the pickled cabbage!"

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:55.750
My third great-uncle gave me that name.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.350
So now you know why I hate him.

00:21:58.150 --> 00:22:00.950
Your third great-uncle
sure had a knack for names.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:04.680
Wang Cuihua...

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:07.920
No wonder you put off mentioning it.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.640
I'll get angry if you keep laughing.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:11.680
Alright, alright.

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:12.810
I'll stop laughing.

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.830
It seems the two of us

00:22:17.830 --> 00:22:19.530
are pretty evenly matched—

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.080
hard to tell who wins.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:24.640
I don't even mind
you're a middle schooler.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:27.150
I'm technically robbing the cradle, okay?

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:29.690
What do you mean robbing the cradle?

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.310
Yes, I was a middle schooler
when I transmigrated here,

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:34.110
but I've spent over 10 years in this book.

00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:36.070
We didn't transmigrate at the same time
after all.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.440
Which year did you come from?

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.000
2016.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720
I'm from the year 2025.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.000
See?

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.400
No wonder.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.130
When we chatted before,

00:22:47.270 --> 00:22:49.000
all your jokes were so old-fashioned,

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:49.480
like

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.640
"blue skinny mushroom,"

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.550
and "Yuanfang, what do you think?"

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:55.480
I felt something was off back then.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.930
Since we're on the subject,

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:01.880
I want to ask you something.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.510
What is the "smell of work"?

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.760
And that saying

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.350
"city or not"—

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:10.830
what does it mean?

00:23:12.350 --> 00:23:14.000
And that thing you always say—

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.460
"Zize"—what does it mean?

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.170
Want to know?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.400
Then repeat after me.

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:22.440
Tell me wh-what it means first.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.110
J-Just repeat after me first.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.020
Fine. Teach me.

00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.790
Zize.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:31.030
Zize.

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:33.640
Zize.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:36.050
Zize.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:38.590
What does it mean?

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:42.290
It just sounds similar to "jiejie,"
meaning older sister.

00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:43.910
Got it?

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.680
Then what about those other things,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.070
like "laying low"
and "winner winner, chicken dinner"?

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.590
You don't know those either?

00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:49.060
I don't.

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:51.610
Then why did you lay low with me
last time?

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.720
I saw you were so fired up,

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:56.190
so I didn't have the heart
to interrupt you.

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.480
Little brat.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.370
And that... What's it called again...

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:01.810
OOC?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.630
And that

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.530
"attention seeker"—

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:06.680
what does it mean?

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.540
I'll tell you what that one means.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.480
You're the definition of
an attention seeker.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.880
I'm the definition of an attention seeker?

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.000
You're an attention seeker.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.550
Remember?

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:15.400
I'm an attention seeker.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.660
T-Then what about you?

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.960
Cen.

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.810
Sorry.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:40.920
Why are you awake?

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.330
Sorry I woke you up.

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.720
Physician Xiao's medicine worked.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.720
You look much better.

00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.750
I want to,

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.480
while I still can,

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.550
make a trip back to my courtyard

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.010
and check on my Yan millet.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.240
But right now,

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:06.790
it's snowing heavily outside.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:08.120
With your condition...

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.350
If I don't go now,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.640
I'm afraid I won't have another chance.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.160
I...

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:42.590
I...

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.440
I'll go with you.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.400
Okay.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.720
If everything goes well,

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.980
by this time tomorrow,

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:07.880
we'll have a bed to sleep in.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.040
We'll send someone
to bring Mr. Bei back later.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.010
Now that Bai is here too,

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.400
our hotpot for four can reopen.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:23.870
By the way.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:26.480
that Xiao Tiancai is still in the palace.

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:27.400
Before I left,

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:30.400
I suggested the idea of
fighting poison with poison to him,

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.930
and he said it was feasible.

00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:33.340
Maybe by now,

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.980
he's already made a breakthrough
in his research.

What have the plants ever done

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:15.050
to deserve such disaster?

00:28:16.270 --> 00:28:19.310
Fortunately, the spring breeze
will bring them back to life.

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:21.110
Cen, you needn't lament so much.

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.880
Yeah.

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:25.640
When I was born,

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.010
I was already afflicted with
a serious illness.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.110
I knew I wouldn't live long.

00:28:40.830 --> 00:28:42.200
Yet, I've always admired how plants,

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.730
though seemingly fragile,

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.780
are actually full of resilience.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.110
Compared to humans' mere few decades
of lifespan,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:53.320
plants can return to life
season after season.

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.490
As long as there's wind,

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.350
rain,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.920
and soil,

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.160
they can grow freely

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:02.110
and joyfully.

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.940
But humans are not plants—

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:06.690
how could we live in solitude?

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.000
Cen,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:10.410
you've grown close to us after all.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.900
If it weren't for you guys
dragging me along,

00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:18.270
not minding my coldness and frailty,

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.690
not looking down on
my dullness and awkwardness,

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.750
I truly wouldn't know

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.000
what I've missed all these years.

00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.640
Er Lan,

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.830
did you know

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.240
that Li

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.440
used to look down on you?

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.550
But now,

00:29:43.790 --> 00:29:45.250
he's sincerely convinced

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:47.750
and holds you in the highest regard.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:50.490
And for a long time,
Yang had quite a few complaints

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:53.050
about the fortune-teller position
at the Imperial Astronomer,

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:54.640
and he often came to me to vent.

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:55.070
Also,

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:57.310
before Wang Zhao went on his mission,

00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:58.710
he asked me to take care of

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:00.880
a lady selling tofu in the East Alley.

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:03.510
That's a secret

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.990
he'll never have the chance
to say out loud.

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.570
Since it's a secret,

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:19.480
why are you

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.450
telling me about it, Cen?

00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:25.960
I'll be counting on you,

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:33.210
Er Lan, to take care of these old friends
from now on.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.000
Okay.

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.200
You have my promise.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.240
Then, Cen,

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.750
would you like to hear my secret?

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.640
For a secret to be a secret,

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:06.190
it's best if the other person
doesn't know.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.940
If humans were like plants

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.200
and had an afterlife,

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:24.570
would you then, Cen?

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.770
If there is a next life,

00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.720
I'd definitely play the zither,

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.030
brew wine,

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:41.690
and listen attentively to it.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.650
[Luo]

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:53.270
[You]

00:32:57.830 --> 00:33:00.820
[Hai]

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:11.350
[You]

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:16.070
[Luo]

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:17.480
[Hai]

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:25.900
[Capital of Xia]

00:33:35.270 --> 00:33:36.000
General Luo,

00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:37.400
Deputy General Lin,

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.480
Deputy General Zhou.

00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.960
Long time no see.

00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:41.400
Lord Jia.

00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.370
We've been waiting here for half a day.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:46.640
Why haven't the soldiers been allowed
into the city yet?

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:47.100
Indeed.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.510
We came at urgent summons,
traveling day and night.

00:33:50.510 --> 00:33:52.170
But judging by the situation,

00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:53.730
it seems no one's in a hurry.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.510
You jest, Generals.

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.510
His Highness indeed
has important matters to discuss,

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.660
so he sent us here to receive you.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:01.960
That's right.

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.720
Generals,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.230
please follow me
and enter the city alone first.

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.520
Just us?

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:09.000
What about the main troops?

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.659
Never mind.

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.800
Since this is His Highness's order,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.300
we shall obey.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:16.630
Li Zhong! You stay.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.760
-Yang Yi!
-Yes!

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:19.000
Take a squad and come with me.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.130
The rest, stand by!

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.909
Please, generals,

00:34:30.030 --> 00:34:31.489
kindly remove your swords

00:34:31.630 --> 00:34:32.840
before entering the city.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.770
What do you mean?

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.290
We led the armies

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.060
all the way here to help.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.670
Is this the courtesy
His Highness Prince Duan shows us?

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.400
Generals, please don't
take this the wrong way.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.280
It's just that

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.110
the situation inside the city

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:45.370
is delicate right now,

00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:47.510
with spies from all sides mingling.

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:48.710
Removing your swords

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.230
is merely a formality.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.230
Yes, indeed.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.730
His Highness has prepared
a grand feast in the city,

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.620
waiting to welcome you generals

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.400
and reward the Three Armies.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:03.450
You lot

00:35:03.800 --> 00:35:05.070
are so twisted

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:06.480
and troublesome.

00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.260
I have nothing to hide.

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:11.810
If you want the swords,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.800
take them.

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.490
You stay here

00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.570
and keep an eye on the Three Armies.

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.360
Didn't Prince Duan himself
summon the Three Armies?

00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.820
Why won't he let the soldiers
enter the city?

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.150
He is

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.840
extremely suspicious.

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.300
Could it be that

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.940
there's some rift
between him and the soldiers?

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.760
But what kind of rift could it be?

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.900
[Memorial Tablet of Emperor Xiaohewen
of Great Xia]

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.780
Your Highness.

00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:30.150
This man

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:34.680
was sent by the Central Army back then,

00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:36.550
right?

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.030
That's right,

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.300
Your Highness.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.780
They also said

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.930
General Luo's trusted aide

00:36:43.230 --> 00:36:44.960
interrogated him personally.

00:36:46.190 --> 00:36:48.590
They sent me an imposter.

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:53.440
How amusing.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:55.680
This man's disguise

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:57.630
was flawless.

00:36:59.110 --> 00:37:00.490
Perhaps General Luo,

00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:01.680
like us,

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.510
was kept completely in the dark?

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:04.520
The Three Armies

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.000
have always been
under Your Highness's command.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:07.280
And

00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.360
General Luo

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:11.240
has technically been through
life and death with you.

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.710
He shouldn't have acted like that, right?

00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:15.240
If there were so many "shoulds"
in this world,

00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.470
Xiahou Dan should've long been dead!

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.050
Yes, Your Highness.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.780
What do the craftsmen say?

00:37:38.070 --> 00:37:39.330
Can they replicate it?

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:40.800
This object

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.230
is designed with exquisite ingenuity.

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:45.970
If we want to produce it
in large quantities,

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:47.560
it'll still take some time.

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.620
Your Highness,

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.200
please be extra careful.

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:02.920
This object is very dangerous.

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:04.230
Don't let it hurt you.

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:07.270
There's only one bullet left.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:10.570
Minister Wu.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.900
Yes.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:13.710
Take a guess—

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.110
whose body will it pierce?

00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:19.030
Your Highness...

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:33.370
Take them away.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:37.480
What's going on?

00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:43.480
The Imperial Guards are searching
the Three Armies one by one.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.830
I saw that they've selected some people

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:47.670
from both the Left and Central Armies.
They seem to be

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:51.130
-searching for suspicious individuals.
-Take this one away.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.840
You've got sharp eyes.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.590
Hurry up and check

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:55.440
what criteria they are using
to select people.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:55.970
This one.

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:56.830
Take him away.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:58.790
They seem to be picking out

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.900
-the short and the weak.
-Move along.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:04.650
Turn around.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.000
Short points to you...

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.080
Take him away.

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.840
And weak points to me.

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:12.060
Take him away.

00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:16.480
So Xiahou Bo...

00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:17.070
Take this one away too.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:19.070
Still hasn't given up on finding us.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:22.880
Luckily, our elite soldiers with guns

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.440
-are all tall and strong.
-Take him away.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:27.700
They shouldn't fall within
the range of their inspection.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.110
Is there anything on our carriage

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:30.570
that could cause trouble?

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.400
All the weapons have been distributed.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.110
Take him away.

00:39:34.110 --> 00:39:35.000
There's some spare gunpowder

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.660
hidden underneath the grain.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.710
But if they conduct a deliberate search,

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.280
there's still a risk of it
being discovered.

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:40.940
This is bad.

00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.680
There's squad heading this way.

00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.920
-They might want to search our carriage.
-Move along.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:49.880
Turn around.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.280
We can't wait for Bai anymore.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:55.000
Let's make our move.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.460
Hold on.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.440
I have an idea.
