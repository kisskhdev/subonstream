[Episode 1]

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.870
Wake up.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.350
My name is Yi Lan.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.840
Today is the first day
of my sophomore year of high school.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.290
This is my neighbor, Tong Xiaole.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.160
By the way,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.000
I'm also...

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.710
an excellent cellist.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.170
Cutting it close again.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.520
Sister,

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.960
are you going to a cello competition?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.120
No, no, no.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.800
Is Xiaole going with you?

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.400
Yes!

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.120
Hurry up and eat something first.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.120
There's no time!

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.840
Why are you carrying your cello?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.840
For the school orchestra audition.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.360
You haven't even figured out your studies.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.370
-I'm leaving!
-Be careful!

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.430
Coming! Coming!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.080
Let's go!

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.960
Tong Xiaole!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.320
You're not waiting for me again!

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.000
[Class 9, Grade 11]

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.840
Just this one sentence.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.800
Remember this key point.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.330
Alright, class dismissed.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.530
Class Representative,
wipe the blackboard.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.430
Mr. Bu.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.150
Well, I've prepared my cello piece.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.430
When is the audition?

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.280
There's too much on my plate
with the start of the semester.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.400
I forgot about that matter.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, your application
was indeed submitted by me.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.079
But I'm not in charge of the orchestra.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.079
You know that too.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.840
They...

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.680
Well, they...

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.840
It seems they've chosen someone else.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.040
Chosen someone else?

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.870
Who?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.560
Wait a moment.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.000
Um...

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.560
Luo Ningzi?

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.400
Mm.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.960
Go in first.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.590
We'll talk later. We'll talk later.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.120
Come! Come!

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.560
Come!

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.560
Come!

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.000
Sorry to take up your break time!

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.000
Go back to your seats, everyone!

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.960
Sit down, everyone.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.240
Let me introduce someone to you.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.430
This is our new transfer student,

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.920
Luo Ningzi.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.390
Luo Ningzi,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.420
introduce yourself to everyone.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.680
Hello, everyone, my name is Luo Ningzi.

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.520
Give her a warm welcome.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.750
That should be the only empty seat
in our class now.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.630
Sit there for now.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.800
We'll rotate seats later.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.360
Okay?

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.430
Help each other out, okay?

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.430
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:47.610
Chinese class.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.360
Class begins.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.360
Stand up!

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.830
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.530
Sit down.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.310
Lan,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.230
so you can't join the orchestra?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.240
She must have been handpicked.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.750
It's fine.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:51.830
She's going to the school orchestra later.

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.560
I'll go take a look.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:53.490
I'll go with you.

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:55.870
You guys plan to skip self-study class?

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:56.750
Count me in.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.159
Xiaole, are you going?

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.960
Are you going?

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:00.830
I'm not interested.

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:01.630
So I'll pass.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.190
We meet again,

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.120
Tong Xiaole.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.390
The way Luo Ningzi looks at Tong Xiaole...

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.870
Something's off.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.670
Did they know each other before?

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.510
How is that possible?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.920
I grew up with Tong Xiaole.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.050
How would I not know?

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.560
Why is Zhao Zhenghao so handsome?

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:09.480
And he studies conducting.

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.890
Don't you think so?

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:14.390
She is indeed good-looking.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.510
And she plays well.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:28.880
Points-Deductor Hu will be here soon.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:29.870
Get lost.

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:45.360
Director Hu.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.560
Director... Director...

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.390
Director Hu. Director Hu.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.880
Director Hu.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.240
Director Hu.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.800
Director Hu.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.659
D-Director Hu.

00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:54.440
Tong Xiaole from Class 9, Grade 11.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.430
Chen Fan from Class 9, Grade 11.

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.190
Yi Lan from Class 9, Grade 11.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.310
Qiao Mengmeng from Class 9, Grade 11.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:01.430
Qiao Mengmeng.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.870
These two strands of hair
on your forehead are too long.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.130
Cut them immediately!

00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:06.270
Yi Lan.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.070
You're at the bottom of the rankings.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.470
You're always involved.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.630
Chen Fan.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.370
Why wear glasses without lenses?

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.800
And look at your clothes.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.680
Sloppy.

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.630
Tong Xiaole.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:25.830
Top of the grade.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.720
Keep it up.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.040
Don't let them lead you astray.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.929
You three, each of you
loses one point for your class!

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.960
The four of us are in the same class.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.720
I know!

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.809
So your class

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.059
will lose 3 points!

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.120
I'll deal with you later.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.550
Points deducted again.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.600
What's wrong with having bad grades?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.440
Why didn't he scold Tong Xiaole?

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.650
What did you say?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.910
It wasn't me.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.750
Where is he?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.920
Why isn't he here yet?

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.280
What a coincidence.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.790
I happen to have a question for you.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.790
How did you know Luo Ningzi?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.080
Why have you never told me about that?

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.840
She plays the cello so well.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.080
It's a bit windy today.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.740
I need to go home early.

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.140
Are you going to tell me or not?

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.440
Luo Ningzi and I

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.150
met at a tutoring class.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.540
Just like you,
she's played the cello since childhood.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:55.790
She's taken part in many competitions.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.320
The only difference is

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:59.930
she has won many national championships.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.320
Then why did she transfer to our school?

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.790
Do you know the High School
Affiliated to Music Conservatory?

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.080
It's full of talented people.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.610
The competition is fierce.

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.960
Maybe she thinks it's...

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.440
easier to apply for studying abroad
from our school,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.840
so she transferred here.

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:25.720
If I get a chance...

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:27.550
I must ask her for advice.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:28.680
Learn a thing or two.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.660
Learning to play the cello

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:35.670
requires a good learning environment
and family support.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.440
It's okay.

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:38.480
You've already worked very hard.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.280
You're great.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:41.270
I know.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.150
Let's go.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.790
The novel Shan ordered for me has arrived.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.550
Let's go to the musical instrument store.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.950
Alright. Get on the bike.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.440
Let's go!

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:56.790
Tong Xiaole,

00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:57.850
what are you doing?

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.550
You...

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.080
Tong Xiaole!

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.200
Miss,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:06.960
where is Shan?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.790
Shan went to restock.

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:09.790
He left it on the fifth shelf for you.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.440
My dad is making me
something delicious tonight.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.790
Come to my place for dinner.

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:43.360
No.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.210
I need to take photos tonight.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.200
Boring.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.150
Take photos. Come.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:07.960
Are we in the frame?

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:08.720
Did you get the shot?

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:09.550
Hurry, hurry.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.870
[Xiaole, I transferred you 1,000 yuan
for living expenses.]

00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:36.420
[Tell me if it's not enough. Your dad
and I will be home a few days late.]

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:45.270
[My life's piece:]

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:48.840
[Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2,
3rd Movement]

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.570
It always brings tears to my eyes,
no matter when.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.240
Someone actually

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.600
has the exact same life piece as me.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.650
If I could become friends with her,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200
I'm not going.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.050
My dad asked me
to go home for dinner tonight.

00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:32.110
Mengmeng, I'm almost done.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.060
I'm leaving first.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.110
Have fun.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.060
I'm leaving first.

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:12.950
Still not going home?

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:27.070
I know. It's very embarrassing.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:29.680
I'm already so upset.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.540
Can you stop saying such harsh words?

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.000
This time...

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.550
what wish do you want to write?

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.100
[Everyone, just forget it.]

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.720
Writing wishes on candy wrappers

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.590
is just a marketing gimmick.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:18.850
None of your business!

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:34.070
It will come true!

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.510
Tell me,

00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:46.830
do I still have a chance?

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.930
How old are you?

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.440
Fifteen.

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:53.550
Exactly.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.720
You're only 15.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.440
Anything is possible.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.510
I'm 15, and she's 15 too!

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.480
I'm working hard,
and she's working hard too!

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.070
I'll never catch up to her!

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.590
Who exactly is Luo Ningzi to you?

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:08.920
Why do you
have to compare yourself to her?

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:10.790
I envy her!

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:11.880
I'm jealous of her!

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.110
We both play the cello.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.960
Why is the gap so huge?

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:25.160
I'm so envious.

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.110
I'm so envious!

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:33.510
I don't think the gap is that huge.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.550
Sometimes, I think
your performance is even...

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:37.070
Shut up!

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.070
I know.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.030
Jealousy is a terrible force.

00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:48.520
I don't want to be jealous of her.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.270
I want her to respect me

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:52.720
and be friends with me.

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:07.470
Which class are you from?

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:09.240
Mr. Hu! Mr. Hu!

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.270
-Run!
-What?

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:10.880
Let's go!

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.830
Stop right there!

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:13.550
Wait for me!

00:31:13.550 --> 00:31:13.880
Stop!

00:31:14.510 --> 00:31:15.510
Wait for me!

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:27.460
