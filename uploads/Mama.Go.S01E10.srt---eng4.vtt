WEBVTT

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.280
Smile! Give me a smile!

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.240
You haven't come since school started.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.880
You've missed so many classes.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:57.840
At this rate,

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.119
did I really get in for nothing?

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:02.679
That manager of yours is way out of line.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
At this stage in your life,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.319
you should focus on studying.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.760
You can't lose sight of the big picture.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.319
Exactly.

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.359
You have to learn to say no.

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:16.280
Excuse me.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.840
Gui Fang, aren't you going to introduce him?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.719
How did he manage to

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.799
blend in with us so naturally?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.519
Are you really Wei Mingtian?

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.280
Are you really Wei Mingtian in the flesh?

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.040
Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:35.400
This is

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.079
the comrade-in-arms who got into college with me.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:39.159
Wei Mingtian.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.799
That's right.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:42.959
Comrades-in-arms.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.400
Comrades-in-arms.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.000
Alright, alright. Eat up, eat up.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:50.359
Eat some more.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.000
Let me hold that for you.

00:01:59.239 --> 00:01:59.760
No need, no need.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:00.719
It's pretty dirty.

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.599
I'll hold it myself.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.879
You have fieldwork classes this early?

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:05.599
Yeah.

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.599
And I was the first in our group to grow seedlings.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.719
What does our school greenhouse look like?

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.960
Can I go see it?

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.159
Part of it should be open to visitors.

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.919
I'll ask the teacher for you later.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.120
But not today.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.759
The student council has meetings these days.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:21.560
It's pretty busy.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.159
The day after tomorrow. If you're free then,

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.560
I should be able to show you around.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:28.400
Gui Fang.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.280
You seem to be living such a fulfilling life.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.759
Quite fulfilling.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.599
I'm in a rush to get to the greenhouse up ahead.

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.599
I can't chat right now.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.120
Let's catch up later. Bye.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.439
But why do I feel like

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.360
you're drifting further and further away from me?

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.439
Rui Rui

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:03.680
Were you waiting for me?

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.479
Auntie

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:07.360
Don't call me Auntie. Don't call me Auntie.

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.639
Gui Fang

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.879
Auntie

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:12.759
Just call me Gui Fang.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.479
Gui Fang

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.879
My mind is still blank right now.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.000
You and Xiaocan kept this from everyone.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.919
Is there a reason you couldn't tell us?

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.479
Actually, about this...

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.960
The doctor warned me...

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.319
that I absolutely couldn't tell anyone.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.159
But I believe...

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:32.800
you definitely wouldn't hurt Xiaocan.

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:34.120
Come here, let me tell you.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.400
This medicine...

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:39.960
was stolen by Xiaocan.

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:42.400
Stolen?

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.800
Look at the effect on me now.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.800
It was purely by accident.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.759
I don't know what happened either.

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:48.919
I just turned into this.

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.879
But this matter...

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:51.199
if anyone else finds out...

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:52.840
Xiaocan could very likely get arrested.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:54.159
And go to jail.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.199
I understand.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.919
I can understand...

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.319
why Xiaocan didn't tell me the truth.

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:03.840
But I can't accept...

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.639
that he treated me like a burden to be thrown away...

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.360
when he broke up with me.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.719
No, no, no.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.879
That's not what he meant.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.439
Xiaocan... But that's just what he did.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.759
Gui Fang.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.120
I came today...

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:15.120
just to clear things up with you.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.399
When it comes to feelings...

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:19.560
I hope...

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.879
it's something Xiaocan and I solve together.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:24.879
But that kid Xiaocan...

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.720
he really likes you a lot.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.839
I know.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.399
But a relationship isn't just about liking someone.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:31.800
Don't you think?

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.920
Anyway...

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.839
I will handle this properly with Xiaocan.

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:43.920
You can rest assured.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.639
I'll go to class now.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.319
Okay, okay, go ahead.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.439
That's great.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.600
How old is she? So mature.

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.759
Rui Jie

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:21.839
Where's Kong Xiaocan?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.279
You're actually coming to find him yourself?

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.600
Did you two make up?

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:27.240
I want to talk to him.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.920
Talk?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.560
Talking is good.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.120
He's working right now.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.279
I'll send you his address.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.240
Thanks.

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.800
How many jobs does he actually work in a day?

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.920
A lot.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.360
I don't know where he is right now either.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.920
Anyway, contact him before you go.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.720
Have a good talk, Rui Jie.

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:52.639
Hello, here is your dish.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.480
Thank you.

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:54.120
Enjoy your meal.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:23.439
Has he been living like this all year?

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.199
I can only say it's been much harder than this.

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.160
I'm not going back.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:08.160
Where are you running? Where are you running?

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.920
We agreed I could attend classes at school this week.

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:10.639
Class is over now.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:11.800
I didn't take up your study time.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.160
Everyone is studying.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:14.480
Their lives are so fulfilling.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:15.959
I... I want the same.

00:08:15.959 --> 00:08:17.480
Do you know if you refuse this job...

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.319
how much we'll have to pay in damages?

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:20.560
Don't push me.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.600
Push me too hard and I'll terminate the contract with you.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.439
The termination fee will ruin you.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:26.759
Let's go.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.160
Go.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.240
Should've just listened earlier.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:44.320
I didn't get in!

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.159
I didn't get in! Stop the car!

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.159
Stop the car!

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:48.399
Stop the car!

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.000
It's not that I won't let you play.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:02.080
No, wait.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.720
It's not that I won't let you go to school.

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:06.000
It's normal to be obsessed with studying.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:06.759
I can understand that.

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.120
But...

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:09.080
You have to understand work-life balance, right?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.039
You can't just go to school forever.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.120
Can you spend your whole life...

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.399
...just studying like this?

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.559
You still have to work eventually.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.440
You can't let the important stuff get delayed.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:17.240
Let me tell you.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.960
I hope I'm wrong more than anyone else.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.879
But this is reality.

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:21.759
This is the most suitable and only path for you.

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:22.279
Do you understand?

00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:23.399
Speak up. Ignoring me?

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:24.840
Not convinced?

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.279
How about this.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.039
This time...

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.679
if you do a good job on this work...

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:34.120
and get good traffic...

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.240
I'll reward you with two sets of exam papers.

00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:43.960
Really.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:46.840
I keep my word.

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:51.279
Alright.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.720
And you.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.039
Is everyone here? Why are you driving?

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.279
Why don't you two just go off on your own?

00:09:58.039 --> 00:09:58.799
So annoying.

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:03.120
Let me tell you.

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.799
What we're filming this time is a...

00:10:04.799 --> 00:10:05.919
romance-themed commercial.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.000
Basically, we're shooting in this amusement park.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.080
As for the content...

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.399
it's you and a young lady...

00:10:10.399 --> 00:10:11.919
going on exciting rides together.

00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:13.720
You... just have fun with it.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:20.919
How about it?

00:10:23.679 --> 00:10:24.159
Is she pretty?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.360
That...

00:10:28.639 --> 00:10:29.080
Is it exciting?

00:10:30.039 --> 00:10:30.559
Exciting.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:31.679
Want to play?

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.720
I'll let you play until you puke later.

00:10:33.879 --> 00:10:34.240
Okay.

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:35.480
Go get ready.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.039
I'll go take care of something.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.320
Tian.

00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.039
I just spoke with the director.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.039
This is our last take.

00:10:44.519 --> 00:10:45.360
We wrap as soon as we finish.

00:10:45.639 --> 00:10:46.000
Is that okay?

00:10:46.919 --> 00:10:47.200
Come here.

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:56.639
Don't swallow. Spit it out.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:59.159
What's wrong with you?

00:10:59.159 --> 00:11:00.399
You don't need to save that mouthful.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.320
By the way, Mike.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.600
I want to invite my classmate to play here.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.960
Can you help me buy two tickets?

00:11:12.639 --> 00:11:13.320
Is there a discount?

00:11:13.639 --> 00:11:14.679
What classmate?

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:15.360
Didn't I tell you...

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.159
to stay away from those civilians?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.399
It's my neighbor.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.039
And my classmate.

00:11:20.559 --> 00:11:21.639
Who usually takes good care of me.

00:11:21.919 --> 00:11:23.480
She always lets me eat at her house for free.

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:24.519
So what if you eat for free?

00:11:24.759 --> 00:11:25.559
No, wait, you...

00:11:26.039 --> 00:11:27.120
So what if you eat her food for free?

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.320
You're a star.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.559
It's her honor that you eat a couple of meals at her house.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:32.200
Neighbors, classmates...

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.960
how did you get mixed up with them?

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.240
I just want to invite them here to have some fun.

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:37.679
Just to thank them.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.080
No.

00:11:39.639 --> 00:11:40.039
Xiao Tian.

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.639
We're ready to shoot another take over there.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.279
Are you okay here?

00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:45.879
I can't do it.

00:11:49.679 --> 00:11:50.639
He can, he can, he can.

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:51.440
I can't do it anymore.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:52.559
You...

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.000
Can you do it or not, Xiao Tian?

00:12:00.559 --> 00:12:01.639
Fine, I'll get you the tickets.

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:05.320
I can do it again.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:05.960
Fine.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.440
Then get ready, we'll shoot another one.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.320
Thanks, Mike.

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:10.200
Shoot well.

00:12:10.919 --> 00:12:11.639
I'll go get you the tickets.

00:12:11.759 --> 00:12:13.080
This kid is growing up too fast.

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:28.080
I was supposed to retire in a few years.

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:31.159
Why do I have to suffer like this here?

00:12:31.799 --> 00:12:32.399
Junior.

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:34.919
Why is it you again?

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.960
Do you have work?

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.080
That you need me to finish for you?

00:12:42.159 --> 00:12:42.840
If not...

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.440
I'm going to finish my own work.

00:12:44.919 --> 00:12:45.279
You carry on.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.200
This kid is growing up pretty fast.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.840
I can go home early tonight.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:01.919
Son.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.519
Mom's making steamed pork today.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:06.320
There'll be a late-night snack for you after work.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:13.799
Brother Wang, you... you're tired today.

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:14.639
Have another bowl.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:15.399
Okay.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:27.360
Sorry.

00:13:27.559 --> 00:13:28.200
We're closing.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:47.480
Kong Xiaocan.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.960
How many grates did you burn today?

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:50.600
Two.

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.559
If you don't watch the grates properly tomorrow...

00:13:52.559 --> 00:13:53.120
I'll dock your pay.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.120
Lock the door in a bit.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.399
My partner.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:06.279
Is the partner tired?

00:14:11.679 --> 00:14:14.080
Occasional disputes are inevitable.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.799
But it's also normal.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.240
That's business.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.559
Once you become partners...

00:14:18.559 --> 00:14:19.639
You just gang up to deceive people.

00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:20.039
Yes.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.399
After locking up...

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.440
Are you going to see other partners?

00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:30.240
No need.

00:14:31.399 --> 00:14:32.159
Then let's talk.

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:41.360
Are you very angry with me?

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.399
These past few days...

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.519
I've been thinking about it too.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.559
If I were you...

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:49.879
What would I do?

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.440
Mom gets sick...

00:14:56.519 --> 00:14:59.159
The family burden suddenly falls on you.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.159
If I were you...

00:15:01.679 --> 00:15:03.320
I would definitely have a breakdown too.

00:15:03.759 --> 00:15:05.200
And wouldn't know what to do.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.240
So back then...

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.039
You were impulsive and confused.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.240
I can understand that.

00:15:15.159 --> 00:15:15.679
Thank you.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.080
But why didn't you rely on me?

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.559
Why didn't you believe...

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:22.200
That I could get through it with you?

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.440
I didn't want you to be sad with me.

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:32.559
To worry with me.

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:35.120
Whether to be sad and worry with you...

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.159
That's my business.

00:15:37.039 --> 00:15:38.799
What gives you the right to decide for me on your own?

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:41.360
Yes.

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.360
I am very angry.

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:44.720
I'm angry about a lot of things.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.120
But what I'm most angry about is this.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.120
You make me feel like you only care about me on the surface.

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:52.399
But you never treated me as...

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:54.080
An equal romantic partner, do you understand?

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:14.120
I'm sorry.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:29.679
Xiao Tian

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.720
I just made some steamed pork with rice flour

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.600
Come have some together

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:34.440
It smells so good

00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:36.240
But I won't eat any

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.159
Why not? Is something wrong?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:40.279
Gui Fang

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.000
Mai Zi Ge booked a commercial for me

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.600
It's filming at the amusement park

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.120
So

00:16:46.879 --> 00:16:48.559
I can bring friends in to play

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.480
You're free tomorrow at 6 PM, right?

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.559
I'll wait for you at the amusement park

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:54.480
You have to come

00:16:54.759 --> 00:16:55.320
You must come

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:56.279
You really have to come

00:16:59.879 --> 00:17:00.919
If we're going, we're going

00:17:00.919 --> 00:17:02.279
Why was he in such a rush today?

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:04.759
Xiaocan

00:17:05.319 --> 00:17:05.880
You're back

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:08.759
Look, I just finished steaming that pork

00:17:08.759 --> 00:17:09.640
I'll serve some for you

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.440
It's fresh out of the pot

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:22.960
What's wrong?

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.319
Did something happen?

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.279
Mom

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:33.920
Since I was little, you often told me

00:17:34.599 --> 00:17:35.759
You hoped I'd grow up quickly

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.960
To become a man and take care of you

00:17:38.759 --> 00:17:39.359
To protect you

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.079
So I felt that when bad things happen

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.200
I have to shoulder them alone

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.480
Is that wrong?

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:56.799
I really don't want Xu Rui to suffer with me

00:18:07.599 --> 00:18:08.720
In Mom's generation

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.680
A woman had to marry a reliable man

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.119
And rely on him

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:16.079
Besides supporting her husband and raising kids

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:18.039
She didn't need to worry about anything else

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.519
That was considered the best marriage

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.960
But girls these days

00:18:25.599 --> 00:18:27.000
Are much stronger than we were

00:18:28.279 --> 00:18:29.960
Xu Rui is the best example

00:18:35.119 --> 00:18:36.400
Alright, go wash your hands

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:37.759
This was just steamed

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.079
Seeing Xiaocan's reaction

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.640
Did those two not talk things through?

00:18:50.599 --> 00:18:52.000
What else can I do

00:18:52.279 --> 00:18:53.720
To create opportunities for them?

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.119
Fang'er

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:00.960
Fang'er

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:01.680
I'm coming

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.160
Xiaoyin

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.720
Free entry?

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.480
For real?

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.000
For real

00:19:05.079 --> 00:19:05.799
Where are Qianqian and the others?

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.440
One has class, one has a date

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.039
Neither can make it

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:08.960
That's a shame

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:09.680
I was thinking

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.319
It'd be livelier with more people

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:12.200
Alright, let's go

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:13.599
Wait, not everyone is here yet

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:15.039
Your cousin?

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.079
Cousin

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:18.160
I'm here, Cousin

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:18.599
Li Wai

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.720
There's someone else?

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.720
How many cousins do you have?

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.559
This is Xiaocan's childhood friend, Li Wai

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:26.079
Right, Xiaocan and I are tight buddies

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.960
We met at school before, you forgot?

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.000
Right, it was you

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.640
You made Xiaocan's nose bleed

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:32.279
When?

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.359
Where did he get hit?

00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:34.119
He's here

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:35.480
Where was he hit? Where is he? Who hit him?

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.039
Did you call the police?

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:36.799
Where? Is he okay?

00:19:36.799 --> 00:19:37.599
Jo- Just kidding

00:19:38.359 --> 00:19:38.799
Just kid-

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:40.960
Is that funny?

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.279
I was afraid you'd be late

00:19:42.319 --> 00:19:43.240
Then just say so

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.720
You don't joke about people's lives like that

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.079
Alright, alright, it's livelier with more people

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:47.160
It's been so long since I've been to an amusement park

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.000
I'm actually a bit excited

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:49.799
Then let's go

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.000
Not everyone is here yet

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.640
Wait a little longer

00:19:51.839 --> 00:19:52.400
There's someone else?

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.440
Gui Fang

00:19:54.079 --> 00:19:54.480
Xiao Rui

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.200
Rui Jie

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:03.200
This is the file you wanted to give me

00:20:06.119 --> 00:20:07.240
There is no file

00:20:07.319 --> 00:20:08.720
I just wanted everyone to get together

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:09.880
To have some fun and relax

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:10.839
And make things lively

00:20:10.839 --> 00:20:11.680
Right, right, right

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:12.039
Let's go

00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.000
Let's go, I'm treating everyone to dinner

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:13.720
Let's go, let's go

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.119
Bro, what are you doing? Let's go

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.000
Hello

00:20:28.119 --> 00:20:29.640
Excuse me, are you Mike?

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:31.640
Mike

00:20:32.839 --> 00:20:33.799
You're Xiao Tian's classmate?

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:34.960
Yes, yes, yes, I am

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.079
They are all Xiao Tian's classmates?

00:20:40.519 --> 00:20:40.920
That's not right

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:42.839
Wasn't it just one person?

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.799
My fault, I didn't say so in advance

00:20:46.359 --> 00:20:47.559
I'll pay for the remaining tickets

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.160
Cousin, how can we let you pay?

00:20:50.319 --> 00:20:51.599
Didn't Wei Mingtian say

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:53.720
His manager was inviting us all to hang out?

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:54.720
Turns out it's just for one person

00:20:55.119 --> 00:20:56.119
That's too stingy

00:20:57.519 --> 00:20:58.759
Xiao Tian isn't like that

00:20:58.839 --> 00:20:59.920
It must be his manager who's stingy

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.160
Don't say that

00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:02.640
Where is his manager anyway?

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.759
Is the manager here? Can't hear him

00:21:03.759 --> 00:21:04.680
How could he hear us?

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.680
Is he here? Hello?

00:21:05.799 --> 00:21:06.240
Right here

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.200
You... You are Mike the Miser?

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.559
Hello, hello

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:12.839
Xiao Tian mentions you often

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:15.400
If we have to pay for tickets

00:21:15.519 --> 00:21:16.319
I'm not going in

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:17.039
I'm leaving first

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:18.599
Then maybe I should also...

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.240
No, no, no

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.680
Don't, don't. We're all here now.

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.599
Why don't we ask Wei Mingtian what's going on?

00:21:22.599 --> 00:21:23.519
This... right?

00:21:24.039 --> 00:21:24.480
Ask him

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:25.359
Wei Mingtian

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.559
Are you there? Superstar Wei Mingtian

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.000
Don't shout

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:28.440
Mingtian

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:28.880
Stop shouting

00:21:29.319 --> 00:21:29.720
I'll pay for you

00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.480
Thanks, Stingy Bro

00:21:33.319 --> 00:21:33.640
By the way

00:21:33.839 --> 00:21:35.480
Have you three girls signed with a company?

00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:36.319
Considering becoming artists?

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.440
I'm considering it, I haven't done it

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:37.880
I haven't signed either

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.400
I don't have a company

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.279
I know all the tricks

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:39.799
I have dreams

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:40.440
I have talent

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.119
I can do eating livestreams

00:21:41.119 --> 00:21:41.920
He's great at eating livestreams

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:42.440
You two won't do

00:21:42.599 --> 00:21:43.400
You two are too handsome

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:53.720
Mingtian

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.039
Tian'er

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:57.799
Wei Mingtian

00:21:58.839 --> 00:21:59.440
Tian'er

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:00.279
Wei Mingtian

00:22:01.279 --> 00:22:01.599
Hurry

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.880
I thought having everyone together would be livelier

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.000
so I invited everyone along

00:22:06.119 --> 00:22:06.960
You don't mind, do you?

00:22:08.039 --> 00:22:08.799
Not at all, not at all

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:09.880
It's good to hang out together

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.880
It's lively together

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:12.759
This cotton candy...

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.359
Cousin, who do I look like?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.039
Kobitos?

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.200
No

00:22:18.839 --> 00:22:20.559
Who is the strongest in the wizarding world?

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.720
The white-haired bro, Dumbledore

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.680
Here, watch my hand, Cousin

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:25.880
Alakazam!

00:22:28.319 --> 00:22:30.160
How old are you, Li Wai?

00:22:30.599 --> 00:22:31.400
The magic failed

00:22:32.359 --> 00:22:32.759
I'm eating it

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.319
Thanks, thanks. Come, taste it

00:22:36.839 --> 00:22:37.839
Can you eat this, Xiao Tian?

00:22:38.319 --> 00:22:38.920
Go ahead, eat it

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:40.079
It's good

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.400
It's good. It's really sweet. Here

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:42.400
Asking me to come here...

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.920
you didn't just want me and Xu Rui to...

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.519
Have a piece, have a piece

00:22:44.519 --> 00:22:45.400
It's bubblegum flavor

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.319
Okay, okay, okay

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.359
You young people solve your own problems

00:22:50.359 --> 00:22:51.440
I'm not interfering

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:51.920
Rui-jie, Rui-jie

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.640
I'm just here to have fun

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:53.799
Xiaoyin

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.160
This is great. Let's go play on that one

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.039
Sure, that looks fun

00:22:56.119 --> 00:22:57.000
Okay, okay, okay. Let's go

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:58.119
Xiao Rui, Xiao Tian, keep up

00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.519
There's no line right now

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:07.119
Brother

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.240
Let me ask you something

00:23:10.039 --> 00:23:11.960
Does Cousin like roses?

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:13.319
What for?

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.680
Such a nice place...

00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:18.359
the timing and location are perfect...

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.359
I want to confess to her

00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:22.559
Bro-in-law

00:23:23.599 --> 00:23:24.519
Have you ridden the Giant Pendulum?

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:26.000
The Giant Pendulum? I have. It's over there

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.039
This one

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.079
Brother, brother... no...

00:23:28.079 --> 00:23:29.200
Does she like them?

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:30.599
Don't you dare

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:31.079
Brother, brother

00:23:31.319 --> 00:23:32.079
You dare

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:19.440
This looks good

00:24:19.759 --> 00:24:20.599
Let's ride this one

00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:21.079
Sure

00:24:21.079 --> 00:24:21.440
Okay

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.720
Let's go, Xiaocan-ge

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.079
Brother, I get you

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:34.599
You... that thing for you...

00:24:34.599 --> 00:24:35.680
is nothing at all

00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:36.839
A piece of cake

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.359
You're truly brave. Let's go

00:24:57.599 --> 00:24:58.920
Oh mommy!

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:01.119
My eyeballs are gonna swing out!

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.200
I'm dizzy, dizzy, dizzy

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.599
That was awesome

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:21.319
So cool

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.359
It was thrilling just watching from down here

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:23.720
Bag

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:25.640
Bag, bag

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.160
Here, take... take your bag

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.039
Ta... take the bag

00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:29.039
He... here's your bag

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.359
It's a shame I didn't go up

00:25:30.359 --> 00:25:30.680
Yeah

00:25:30.759 --> 00:25:31.640
Which one do you think looks good?

00:25:31.759 --> 00:25:32.480
Does this look good?

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:33.440
This doesn't look good

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.319
Then what about this one?

00:25:35.319 --> 00:25:36.319
What about this one with the open mouth?

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:37.079
That's even uglier

00:25:37.079 --> 00:25:37.920
Can't even use this

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.000
My eyes aren't even open

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:40.960
By the way

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.359
Thanks for what happened last time

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.279
Sure

00:25:45.359 --> 00:25:45.839
Which time?

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:49.240
The time Fang'er and I got drunk and went to your place

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:50.640
Sorry for the trouble

00:25:52.839 --> 00:25:53.480
Oh, that time

00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.200
No problem, no problem

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.079
And that other time

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:02.759
That time at the court

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.480
You bled for me

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.319
And...

00:26:08.279 --> 00:26:08.640
What about it?

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.799
It's nothing, it's nothing

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:12.000
It's fine, don't mention it

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.279
Her friends are my friends

00:26:13.279 --> 00:26:14.559
We count as friends from now on

00:26:14.559 --> 00:26:15.359
Xiao Xi, don't be so polite

00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:18.279
My name is Xiao Yin

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:19.519
Isn't your name Xu Xi?

00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.640
Xu... Xu Xi didn't come

00:26:21.759 --> 00:26:22.759
I'm Chen Xiaoyin

00:26:25.039 --> 00:26:25.400
Right

00:26:26.359 --> 00:26:27.519
Gui Fang mentions you all the time

00:26:28.319 --> 00:26:28.839
I remembered wrong

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.039
Xiao Yin, Xiao Yin

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:36.680
I'm alive again

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.319
I could go for another round

00:26:38.839 --> 00:26:39.400
Let's go, Cousin

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.599
Cousin, what's wrong?

00:26:43.119 --> 00:26:44.000
Are you not feeling well?

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:44.640
I'm fine, I'm fine

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.279
Let me fan you

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:46.680
Let me massage your shoulders

00:26:46.839 --> 00:26:48.000
Is she not feeling well? Stay away from her

00:26:48.319 --> 00:26:50.200
Xiaocan, help me pick some more photos

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.039
Which one do you think?

00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:55.640
Cousin, I'd better fan you

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:58.319
What is going on with you two?

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.839
Cousin isn't feeling well

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.440
You really don't know how to treat a lady

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.920
There are plenty of people to care for her, she doesn't need you

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:04.519
It's fine, it's fine

00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:06.240
It's just my first time on this

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:07.680
I just need to rest a bit and I'll be fine

00:27:07.799 --> 00:27:08.799
Why don't you eat something sweet?

00:27:09.079 --> 00:27:10.240
I know, I know where they sell some

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.119
I'll go buy it for you right now

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:12.079
Let's go, brother, come with me

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:13.799
Something sweet, right?

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:17.960
Fang'er, what did they go do?

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:19.200
To buy things

00:27:19.319 --> 00:27:20.119
Then I'll go help

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:20.799
They can't carry it all

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.720
Xiao Rui, why don't you go with them?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:27.960
Can you sports students not eat sweets?

00:27:28.319 --> 00:27:29.160
You go buy something else

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.039
Okay

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:42.519
Tian

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:44.960
Why are you back?

00:27:45.319 --> 00:27:45.839
Take good care of her.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.279
Take care of yourself.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:48.759
Alright, go on.

00:27:57.319 --> 00:27:58.240
Are you okay, Gui Fang?

00:27:59.519 --> 00:28:00.039
I'm fine.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.559
How about you? You okay?

00:28:01.799 --> 00:28:02.359
I'm alright.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.160
That's good.

00:28:04.079 --> 00:28:05.200
Actually, if it weren't for Li Wai...

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.880
hovering in front of me just now,

00:28:07.559 --> 00:28:09.240
I could've gone for another round.

00:28:11.519 --> 00:28:12.160
You're amazing.

00:28:12.279 --> 00:28:13.480
Why don't we take a break?

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720
Then go for another round.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.400
Ride it one more time.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.640
Can you handle it?

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:19.799
Sure.

00:28:20.359 --> 00:28:21.640
I can, I can.

00:28:22.599 --> 00:28:24.279
You don't look like you can handle it.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.599
Let me see.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.839
How about this one? Is this okay?

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.480
This one looks like it changes colors.

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:33.680
I haven't ridden it either.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.160
This is good, this is good.

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:34.799
This is good, right?

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.279
Let's do this one.

00:28:35.279 --> 00:28:35.960
Then let's go ride this one.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:36.480
Okay.

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:37.359
Let's go line up first.

00:28:37.599 --> 00:28:39.079
Let's go. I'll message them in a bit.

00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:40.400
I'll get the cousin's share.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.079
Don't fight over it.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:41.759
We don't need you to.

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.319
You better behave yourself.

00:28:43.519 --> 00:28:44.480
No, what are you doing?

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:46.720
I...

00:28:50.039 --> 00:28:51.319
No, Rui, what's with you two?

00:28:51.319 --> 00:28:52.799
Why are you targeting me like this?

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.599
I just like the cousin.

00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:56.119
I haven't done anything terrible.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.000
You said you two broke up.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.680
And you won't let me be happy? Seriously.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.920
Trust us, it's really for your own good.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.599
Xiaocan.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.240
Have the three of you known each other long?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.519
A long time.

00:29:18.279 --> 00:29:18.640
So...

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:19.839
Um...

00:29:20.839 --> 00:29:23.200
Are you and Xu Rui dating?

00:29:44.359 --> 00:29:44.920
I see.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.319
We used to be.

00:29:51.799 --> 00:29:52.519
But we can only be...

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.160
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.559
The cousin's gonna get low blood sugar soon.

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:02.039
Can you guys hurry up?

00:30:02.039 --> 00:30:03.599
I'm warning you, stay away from her.

00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:04.880
Or I'll feed you to the pendulum ride, hear me?

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.319
You just don't know how to care for people.

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:07.839
The fireworks show is starting soon.

00:30:07.839 --> 00:30:09.200
The best time to confess.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.160
Stop dawdling.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:10.799
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:12.000
If you keep this up... I'm cutting ties with...

00:30:18.279 --> 00:30:18.799
Xu Rui.

00:30:19.799 --> 00:30:20.640
Help me out here.

00:30:21.319 --> 00:30:22.559
He and the cousin really aren't a match.

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:24.279
I really don't know how to deal with him anymore.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.079
My buddy's own mom,

00:30:27.079 --> 00:30:28.000
His own godmother.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.039
No need to buy a two-bedroom apartment,

00:30:30.279 --> 00:30:31.359
I could dig one out with my toes.

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:32.960
Now you know.

00:30:46.759 --> 00:30:48.680
The line's moving faster than I thought.

00:30:48.839 --> 00:30:49.480
It really is.

00:30:50.839 --> 00:30:51.440
We're almost there.

00:30:57.839 --> 00:30:58.480
Xiaocan.

00:30:58.799 --> 00:30:59.920
Xiao Tian and I...

00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.039
...are in line for the Ferris wheel right now.

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:04.559
Hurry up and get here.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.359
We'll wait for you.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.359
Actually, it's my first time at an amusement park.

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.720
And my first time riding a Ferris wheel.

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:11.720
It's my first time too.

00:31:11.839 --> 00:31:12.359
Really?

00:31:12.519 --> 00:31:12.960
Really.

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:14.519
If you put it that way...

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.160
We should thank Mike.

00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:20.400
Mike is actually a really good guy.

00:31:21.319 --> 00:31:22.000
But...

00:31:23.279 --> 00:31:24.960
I don't like the work he arranges for me.

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.680
Especially those...

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:28.599
red carpet events and stuff like that.

00:31:29.319 --> 00:31:30.519
Everyone else is a real star.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.240
They can sing, dance, and act.

00:31:35.039 --> 00:31:35.880
I can't do anything.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.319
I only know how to farm.

00:31:37.559 --> 00:31:38.319
Don't say that.

00:31:38.319 --> 00:31:40.160
Knowing how to farm is already amazing.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:41.119
That's really impressive.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:45.359
Gui Fang.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.480
I'm really happy today.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:48.640
Are you happy today?

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:52.599
I'm happy when I make money.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.480
I'm happy when there's a good harvest.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.680
And even happier when it rains back home.

00:31:58.599 --> 00:31:59.079
Anyway...

00:32:00.039 --> 00:32:01.079
hanging out with you today...

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.759
makes me really, really happy.

00:32:04.559 --> 00:32:05.480
In the future...

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.079
you'll have plenty of happy moments.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:10.160
Like going to school...

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:10.839
are you happy?

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.920
Didn't you want to build a dam...

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:13.880
for your hometown?

00:32:14.319 --> 00:32:16.160
When that dam is finished...

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.079
the sense of achievement you'll feel...

00:32:18.319 --> 00:32:20.400
will make you even happier.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.359
Gui Fang, you're beautiful.

00:32:41.839 --> 00:32:43.400
Gui... Gui Fang, l-look.

00:32:43.839 --> 00:32:44.319
It's so beautiful.

00:32:46.319 --> 00:32:46.839
So beautiful.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.119
Alright, alright.

00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:53.160
How did you find out?

00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:55.240
Auntie told me.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.799
My mom really has a big...

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:58.240
Are you okay?

00:32:58.519 --> 00:33:00.079
Are you feeling unwell anywhere?

00:33:00.079 --> 00:33:00.759
Did you have an accident?

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.720
Did something suddenly fall on you?

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:02.359
No? Did it?

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:03.799
Don't worry.

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.119
I haven't told anyone.

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.200
I know it's your secret.

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.680
No, that's not what I meant. I...

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.359
Fine, as long as you're okay.

00:33:12.319 --> 00:33:12.759
Xu Rui.

00:33:13.599 --> 00:33:14.799
There are things I really can't tell you.

00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:16.279
I'm keeping them from my mom too.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.240
Neither of you know.

00:33:17.559 --> 00:33:18.640
It's very complicated.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.799
I know you want to share the burden.

00:33:21.319 --> 00:33:21.759
But I can't let you.

00:33:21.759 --> 00:33:23.000
I have to face this alone.

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:24.079
So...

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:27.920
do you understand?

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:28.640
Kong Xiaocan.

00:33:29.759 --> 00:33:30.720
Today...

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.680
I just want a clear answer to one thing.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.559
Do you want to get back together or not?

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:59.119
Xiaocan, Xiao Tian and I are at the front.

00:33:59.119 --> 00:33:59.799
Where are you guys?

00:33:59.799 --> 00:34:00.799
Why aren't you here yet?

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:02.480
Hello.

00:34:02.559 --> 00:34:03.559
Welcome to the Ferris wheel.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:04.359
How many in your party?

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:06.079
Just the two of us.

00:34:06.319 --> 00:34:08.079
But we have friends behind us.

00:34:08.079 --> 00:34:08.719
They're not here yet.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.000
Right.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.880
So, do you want to board now?

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.159
We waited so long to get here.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:16.199
Why don't we...

00:34:18.039 --> 00:34:18.519
just get on?

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.079
Okay.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:19.960
Please.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:20.800
Thanks.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.320
Watch your step.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.079
It's so beautiful.

00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:25.199
So pretty.

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.599
The atmosphere is perfect.

00:35:40.199 --> 00:35:42.400
The atmosphere isn't quite right.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.440
This kid doesn't have feelings for me, does he?

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:46.480
Cousin...

00:35:51.039 --> 00:35:53.159
Why did you have to get on the Ferris wheel with Wei Mingtian?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:54.800
It's so romantic, too.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.800
What a great opportunity.

00:35:58.639 --> 00:35:59.880
The timing, the place, and the people are all perfect.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.800
Kong Xiaocan, it's all your fault.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.119
You're just so wishy-washy.

00:36:04.719 --> 00:36:05.320
Where are those two?

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.199
They turned down another path long ago.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.480
I knew they still liked each other.

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:15.800
They're definitely getting back together.

00:36:16.079 --> 00:36:17.320
It's all within my expectations.

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:23.519
Well, not entirely within my expectations.

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.079
In the end,

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:28.400
we're the only ones left.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:39.880
I do.

00:36:44.199 --> 00:36:45.000
I want to get back together.

00:36:51.119 --> 00:36:51.960
But I can't.

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:54.599
Do you want a beating?

00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:56.519
Xu Rui.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.320
You know how much I like you.

00:37:00.639 --> 00:37:02.039
But if I get back together with you now,

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.280
I feel it would be irresponsible.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.440
The situation I'm facing right now...

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:07.760
I have no choice.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.320
But I don't want you to misunderstand either.

00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:13.559
I hope...

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.039
we can still be friends.

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:18.840
Is that okay?

00:37:22.239 --> 00:37:22.880
Kong Xiaocan.

00:37:24.079 --> 00:37:24.719
Let me tell you something.

00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:28.159
I can live perfectly fine without you.

00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:30.360
I know how to make myself happy.

00:37:31.039 --> 00:37:32.559
I know there are still many people who love me.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:34.760
In this past year without you,

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.239
I've lived a very, very fulfilling life.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:39.480
Also,

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:44.199
I don't need you as a friend.

00:37:47.719 --> 00:37:48.519
The mood is set.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.599
Now it's just the two of us.

00:37:53.039 --> 00:37:53.599
Come on.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.559
It's now or never.

00:37:58.039 --> 00:37:58.760
Confess to her.

00:37:59.079 --> 00:37:59.480
Gui Fang.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:00.599
I...

00:38:01.159 --> 00:38:02.320
I have something to say. Mingtian, listen to me first.

00:38:08.239 --> 00:38:09.679
If it's not what I'm thinking,

00:38:12.039 --> 00:38:13.119
then I owe you an apology.

00:38:14.679 --> 00:38:16.239
But if it is what I'm thinking,

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:19.639
then I need to formally say to you:

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:23.639
Thank you.

00:38:26.039 --> 00:38:27.280
But we can only be friends.

00:38:42.599 --> 00:38:44.400
The Big Pendulum was totally worth it.

00:38:50.039 --> 00:38:50.920
Riding that Big Pendulum...

00:38:51.719 --> 00:38:53.079
brought out your dark circles.

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:56.960
Are you blind?

00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.320
My makeup is smudged.

00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.039
Can't you tell with those huge colored contacts?

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:02.239
I'm not wearing colored contacts.

00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:03.519
I was born like this.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:04.480
Look if you don't believe me.

00:39:05.119 --> 00:39:05.719
I'm not looking.

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:06.480
Just look.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:07.519
No.

00:39:07.519 --> 00:39:08.719
Seriously, just look.

00:39:09.079 --> 00:39:10.000
I'm really not wearing contacts.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.880
Get lost. I'm really not.

00:39:48.239 --> 00:39:49.800
I know love is beautiful.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.119
But you've fallen for the wrong person.

00:39:54.239 --> 00:39:56.119
The person who should be riding alongside you...

00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:57.360
is not me.

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:01.880
In this life,

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:05.079
I hope to face my journey solo,

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.800
walking the world alone.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:26.400
Is this the world of young people?

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.480
Is this the joy of young people?

00:40:39.159 --> 00:40:39.840
Go for it!

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:40.800
Go for it!

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.480
Go for it, children!

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:44.599
Children!

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.159
Mom...

00:40:54.159 --> 00:40:55.679
Oh, Mom...

00:41:01.159 --> 00:41:06.440
Being young is so thrilling!
