00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:57.815
Therefore, the defense's request,
a medical demonstration is denied,

00:00:57.955 --> 00:01:00.725
and the defendant is sentenced
to the maximum penalty allowed by law,

00:01:01.185 --> 00:01:02.925
the death penalty.

00:01:10.665 --> 00:01:12.905
(Defendant)

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:30.915
Excuse me, Your Honor.

00:01:35.125 --> 00:01:38.965
Why did you give more weight
to the Forensic Service's findings?

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:41.025
Because I had to err
on the side of caution.

00:01:41.165 --> 00:01:43.735
But that completely rules out
its potential as a treatment.

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:48.435
What's important in this case
is the murder, not the treatment.

00:01:48.505 --> 00:01:52.275
Considering the potential benefits
for patients with incurable diseases,

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:54.345
shouldn't you at least allow
the medical demonstration?

00:01:54.905 --> 00:01:57.615
The court believes that
being protected from crime...

00:01:57.675 --> 00:02:00.215
is a greater public interest
than receiving treatment.

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:03.215
Terminally ill children are also
desperately waiting for that treatment.

00:02:03.285 --> 00:02:06.555
- If we turn our back on that hope...
- Counsel!

00:02:20.605 --> 00:02:22.375
- Here she comes!
- Here she comes!

00:02:23.875 --> 00:02:25.275
A motive has been established.

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:28.475
Why did you insist it was a random killing
in the early stages of the investigation?

00:02:28.575 --> 00:02:31.415
The case is still ongoing,
so I can't comment at this time.

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.045
- One more comment, please!

- She isn't in yet.

00:02:44.895 --> 00:02:47.565
She said she went to another crime scene
and would be back late.

00:02:57.675 --> 00:02:59.645
- Yes, Director Oh.
- Where are you right now?

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:01.105
I'm working.

00:03:01.675 --> 00:03:03.715
I told you to be
at the Criminal Division Meeting.

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:06.115
Everyone came for you. What's the point
if the guest of honor isn't here?

00:03:07.015 --> 00:03:09.615
The first trial just ended.
This is no time to celebrate.

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.255
There you go again.
This is why you never get ahead.

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:17.325
- The trial comes first, Director.
- Spare me.

00:03:18.055 --> 00:03:20.295
At least drop by the team dinner later.
All right?

00:03:21.265 --> 00:03:22.965
I'll see how things are
and get back to you.

00:03:28.735 --> 00:03:29.735
Ligature marks?

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.245
- It definitely looks like a homicide.
- The murder weapon?

00:03:33.775 --> 00:03:37.845
Nothing was found at the scene,
but we'll need to investigate further.

00:03:39.785 --> 00:03:41.945
It could be someone connected
to Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:45.315
Right, we'll look into that too
and get back to you.

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:50.995
Yes. Hello? Right.

00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:52.525
Okay.

I had him assigned.
We were classmates at the institute.

another card up his sleeve for the appeal?

00:04:41.575 --> 00:04:43.545
In golf, the most important thing
is the address.

00:04:43.815 --> 00:04:46.415
Your initial stance.
If your stance is off,

00:04:46.985 --> 00:04:50.785
even Tiger Woods will shank it.
But Park Han Jun?

00:04:51.355 --> 00:04:53.485
His swing is based on
a fundamentally flawed stance.

00:04:54.025 --> 00:04:56.025
He can try a million times,
but it's no use.

00:04:58.425 --> 00:05:01.625
Besides, the first trial set a precedent
for the appellate court.

in receiving treatment.

People online will make a joke
out of anything.

00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:57.055
Still, we can't ignore it.
This can easily shape public opinion.

- Yes.

It should have shifted in my favor by now.

So you care more about public opinion
than the trial's outcome?

00:06:22.245 --> 00:06:26.445
We already expected this verdict.
Death penalty cases go to a third trial,

00:06:26.645 --> 00:06:29.115
so we need to win over
as many people as possible by then.

00:06:31.255 --> 00:06:35.085
As a matter of fact,
regardless of the verdict,

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:38.895
there's growing talk that your ability
to cure people should be tested.

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:42.195
Your blood mutation was
officially recognized in the States.

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.565
So we're going to appeal
and ask the court...

00:06:45.635 --> 00:06:48.665
to re-evaluate the value
of your treatment.

00:06:49.275 --> 00:06:50.275
And...

00:06:51.675 --> 00:06:53.275
we're also going to request
what you want most.

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:55.675
The medical demonstration.

00:06:57.245 --> 00:06:58.245
Good.

00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:00.745
However, I'm afraid...

00:07:01.845 --> 00:07:03.155
that the medical demonstration...

00:07:03.915 --> 00:07:05.785
is very likely to be rejected.

00:07:06.785 --> 00:07:10.455
The appeals judge is an old classmate
of Director Oh, Prosecutor Cha's boss.

00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:19.305

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:25.135

in having this trial.

It's really late now,
so I think that's a good idea.

00:08:51.825 --> 00:08:54.825
You missed me a lot too, right?

he misses his little girl.

Batten disease is incurable.

00:09:58.995 --> 00:10:02.065
Especially for someone like Min Seo,
once the initial symptoms appear,

00:10:02.865 --> 00:10:05.295
death within a few years is a certainty.

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:09.975
cure Batten disease?

You remember the evidence
that Attorney Park submitted, right?

00:10:51.845 --> 00:10:54.045
The files on that treatment
Lee Woo Gyeom researched...

00:10:54.645 --> 00:10:56.555
back when he was a med student.

00:10:57.555 --> 00:11:01.755
This is the research for a treatment
the defendant submitted...

00:11:02.025 --> 00:11:04.025
to a competition held by
the global medical group, Chaeum.

00:11:04.355 --> 00:11:08.665
At the time, the defendant's idea
was highly praised by Chaeum's team,

00:11:08.725 --> 00:11:12.865
and we've confirmed
they actually discussed developing it.

00:11:16.005 --> 00:11:18.975
It turns out the victim, Song Min Su,
also came from Chaeum.

00:11:19.575 --> 00:11:24.545
As a senior researcher,
he even scored Lee's submission highly.

00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:28.585
After he left Chaeum, he and Prof. Han,
Lee Woo Gyeom's doctor,

00:11:28.685 --> 00:11:31.185
apparently started
the Jinnam Research Institute.

00:11:31.615 --> 00:11:34.555
It's possible he was still in contact
with Lee Woo Gyeom from there.

00:16:20.975 --> 00:16:21.975

00:16:33.085 --> 00:16:34.485

00:16:44.265 --> 00:16:45.495

00:16:48.565 --> 00:16:50.075

Mr. Park!

00:18:48.185 --> 00:18:50.755
I just heard Lee Woo Gyeom was taken
to the hospital this morning.

00:18:56.665 --> 00:19:00.105
They'll most likely reject
the medical demonstration.

00:19:06.335 --> 00:19:07.345
Come on, so what?

00:19:08.375 --> 00:19:10.075
If I can't do the medical demonstration,

00:19:10.315 --> 00:19:11.975
then there's no point
in having this trial.

00:19:14.485 --> 00:19:16.185
We need to have a backup plan.

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:19.215
A backup plan? What kind of backup plan?

00:19:19.985 --> 00:19:21.955
Is there a better plan
than the medical demonstration?

00:19:23.325 --> 00:19:24.325

I'll take care of the rest.

00:19:55.285 --> 00:19:58.425
The only way to make sure
the court can't refuse the medical demo...

00:19:59.695 --> 00:20:00.865
is this.

but it'll take way too long.

00:20:22.615 --> 00:20:24.955
I'm going to improvise a little.

00:20:28.955 --> 00:20:29.955
How?

00:20:30.225 --> 00:20:31.455
I'll have to put my life on the line.

00:20:32.355 --> 00:20:34.125
If I hadn't put my own body
on the line in the first place,

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:37.535
I never would've found the cure.
Besides, you...

00:20:38.665 --> 00:20:41.705
- You risked it all for Min Seo?
- You...

00:20:43.035 --> 00:20:44.435
You're on trial right now.

00:20:45.535 --> 00:20:47.545

- The worst is a death sentence.

00:20:49.205 --> 00:20:50.315
I don't care about that.

As long as I can prove what I am,

00:20:55.785 --> 00:20:57.885
the sentence means nothing to me.

00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:00.885

00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:02.985

He's showing symptoms
of shock from blood loss.

00:21:10.535 --> 00:21:12.935
We've never seen a case this unusual,

00:21:13.435 --> 00:21:15.365
so it's a good thing
Professor Han Sang Ho came when he did.

00:21:15.935 --> 00:21:19.035

- Professor Han Sang Ho?

How would Professor Han Sang Ho
know to come here?

00:21:22.305 --> 00:21:25.575
The patient gave us
his contact information.

00:21:26.215 --> 00:21:28.515
Said he was a patient of his,
diagnosed with a blood mutation.

00:21:33.085 --> 00:21:36.425
Administering it to a human is impossible.

00:21:36.925 --> 00:21:39.995
What happened to the man
who was stabbed by Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:21:43.565 --> 00:21:47.405
He had severe internal bleeding, was out,
and it was an emergency,

00:21:47.905 --> 00:21:50.405
but Lee Woo Gyeom drew his own blood...

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:53.645
and transfused it directly
into the patient, Bae Geun Hyeok.

00:21:54.605 --> 00:21:57.345
But get this.
Not only did the stab wound heal,

00:21:57.545 --> 00:22:00.145
his congenital corneal damage
was cured as well.

00:22:00.445 --> 00:22:03.085
He made a full recovery
in just a few hours.

00:22:04.155 --> 00:22:06.555
Is that even possible?

00:22:06.755 --> 00:22:09.655

Regarding the defense's request
for a medical demonstration...

00:22:34.985 --> 00:22:36.185
We have reviewed it thoroughly.

00:22:37.515 --> 00:22:38.915
And this appellate court,

00:22:39.555 --> 00:22:43.185
in agreement with the lower court,
will also deny the medical demonstration.

00:22:44.695 --> 00:22:47.695
Therefore, both sides should prepare
for a standard trial.

00:22:49.465 --> 00:22:50.995
A wise decision, Your Honor.

00:22:52.195 --> 00:22:54.465
We are filing a motion...

00:22:56.165 --> 00:22:57.175
for a constitutional review.

00:22:57.705 --> 00:23:02.475
- You demand the medical demonstration?
- That's correct.

00:23:02.745 --> 00:23:05.115
If Lee Woo Gyeom can truly cure
an incurable disease,

00:23:05.945 --> 00:23:09.445
I believe that's ample reason
to consider it in his sentencing.

00:23:10.015 --> 00:23:13.185
No.
The court's deliberation on this is over.

00:23:19.725 --> 00:23:23.095
Filing a constitutional petition
is at the discretion of the defense,

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:24.835
You may proceed if you must,

00:23:25.895 --> 00:23:28.835
but the appeal will proceed as scheduled.

00:23:29.635 --> 00:23:30.635

from Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:24:20.685 --> 00:24:23.855
Yes. I just found out
from the article myself,

so I'm looking into the details now.

Seriously, what's with
that jerk Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:24:29.065 --> 00:24:31.235
If he had something to prove,
he should've done it way sooner.

00:24:31.635 --> 00:24:34.505
He had to know that a death penalty case
goes to a third trial.

00:24:35.165 --> 00:24:36.165

- Please, don't doubt me.
- What? Hey, do you even hear yourself?

This court,

00:24:57.355 --> 00:24:59.695
after carefully reviewing
the defendant Lee Woo Gyeom's...

00:25:00.095 --> 00:25:03.865
recent act of providing
medical treatment in prison,

00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:08.665
has determined that it is necessary
to verify his medical abilities.

00:25:08.865 --> 00:25:12.275
An unprecedented decision has been made
in South Korea's constitutional history.

00:25:12.575 --> 00:25:16.945
The court handling the Lee Woo Gyeom case
has approved the medical demonstration.

Professor Han Sang Ho?

00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:29.325
According to the attending physician,
Lee Woo Gyeom called Prof. Han Sang Ho,

00:25:29.385 --> 00:25:31.855
and he confirmed that Bae Geun Hyeok
was transfused with Lee Woo Gyeom's blood.

00:25:35.525 --> 00:25:38.195
I checked Lee Woo Gyeom's visitor log

she's apparently treating their daughter

Maybe it's not us.

00:28:57.465 --> 00:28:59.565
He could be avoiding someone else.

00:29:04.935 --> 00:29:05.975
Thanks for all your hard work.

00:29:06.405 --> 00:29:09.005
So now, I just have to do well
in the medical demonstration.

00:29:10.005 --> 00:29:11.215
Let me confirm something first.

00:29:12.175 --> 00:29:13.175
About what?

00:29:14.745 --> 00:29:16.215
What was Professor Han's part in this?

00:29:16.915 --> 00:29:17.955
Professor Han?

00:29:20.555 --> 00:29:21.885
I reached out to him myself.

00:29:23.895 --> 00:29:26.425
- What's your relationship with him?
- What do you mean, relationship?

00:29:26.925 --> 00:29:28.265
He was just my doctor.

00:29:29.365 --> 00:29:32.065
If Professor Han knew about
your condition from the start,

00:29:33.535 --> 00:29:34.665
then he must have known about the cure...

00:29:35.465 --> 00:29:36.665
as well.

00:29:37.105 --> 00:29:38.575
What are you talking about?
He didn't know.

00:29:39.675 --> 00:29:44.375
And stop trying to connect the two of us.
He and I are nothing alike.

00:29:45.545 --> 00:29:46.545
How so?

00:29:47.615 --> 00:29:51.515
I'm telling you. That man has no idea
how to make the cure.

00:29:53.155 --> 00:29:55.055
He spent his whole life
trying to develop a cure,

00:29:55.125 --> 00:29:58.555
but he failed. Of course
I'm different from a loser like him.

00:29:59.695 --> 00:30:03.695
He visited me before and kept asking
how I developed the cure.

00:30:04.195 --> 00:30:06.265
It was so annoying.

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:10.135
Still, I guess I can see why
someone like him would do that.

00:30:11.235 --> 00:30:14.245
- Is that all?
- What'd you expect? That we were dating?

00:30:18.215 --> 00:30:21.615
Do you happen to know where
Professor Han might be staying?

00:30:23.285 --> 00:30:24.555
Why? Can't you reach him?

00:30:24.815 --> 00:30:27.225
No, I can't get ahold of him.
For our case,

00:30:27.825 --> 00:30:30.455
he's the only witness
who can testify about you.

00:30:32.055 --> 00:30:34.225
Let's not worry about Professor Han...

00:30:35.025 --> 00:30:36.725
and just focus on
the medical demonstration.

00:30:37.695 --> 00:30:39.195
We're so close to the finish line.

00:30:39.765 --> 00:30:41.235
We need to see this demonstration
through to the end.

00:30:41.635 --> 00:30:45.205
Instead of looking for Professor Han,
go buy a gift for Min Seo.

00:31:06.925 --> 00:31:09.595
You pulled off the medical demonstration
after all.

00:31:10.665 --> 00:31:11.695
Congratulations.

00:31:14.365 --> 00:31:15.735
You know, it's amazing...

00:31:16.435 --> 00:31:17.535
how you never change.

00:31:19.235 --> 00:31:21.105
Then and now, whenever you lie,

00:31:21.805 --> 00:31:23.805
the corner of your mouth
curls up slightly.

00:31:24.675 --> 00:31:25.815
When do I do that?

00:31:26.475 --> 00:31:29.645
And when you're embarrassed,
you always look away.

00:31:30.245 --> 00:31:31.285
Some things never change.

00:31:33.085 --> 00:31:36.055
Why on earth do you have to go through
with this medical demonstration?

00:31:37.225 --> 00:31:38.295
To prove his motive.

00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:40.055
But he already confessed.

00:31:40.795 --> 00:31:44.265
If his confession were enough,
then his sentence should be reconsidered.

00:31:45.535 --> 00:31:46.965
Is that really why you're doing this?

00:31:47.835 --> 00:31:49.635
Just to get his sentence reduced?

00:31:49.935 --> 00:31:51.405
Why? Does that make you nervous?

00:31:52.105 --> 00:31:54.475
You're the one who's nervous, not me.

00:31:55.645 --> 00:31:57.615
Why did you hide
what's happening with Min Seo?

00:31:58.075 --> 00:32:01.385
Hiding something
and not saying anything are different.

00:32:01.885 --> 00:32:02.885
Besides,

00:32:03.215 --> 00:32:05.985
why would you need to know about
the opposing counsel's personal life?

00:32:08.555 --> 00:32:09.555
Stay out of it.

00:32:10.485 --> 00:32:12.155
So is that why,
back at the training institute,

00:32:13.325 --> 00:32:16.965
you'd get drunk and keep telling me
that, "People come before the law,"

00:32:17.025 --> 00:32:18.565
and stay up all night repeating yourself?

00:32:20.195 --> 00:32:21.205
Han Jun.

00:32:22.105 --> 00:32:23.605
Even now, at the Judicial Research
and Training Institute,

00:32:24.135 --> 00:32:26.205
you're still held up as a model example.

00:32:28.405 --> 00:32:29.575
Well, I guess it's about time...

00:32:30.145 --> 00:32:31.445
for that to change, then.

00:32:31.515 --> 00:32:35.385
What happened to the prosecutor who always
put away every scumbag he could find?

00:32:35.445 --> 00:32:38.255
I'm simply doing the best I can
for my client.

00:32:38.315 --> 00:32:39.985
But this is Lee Woo Gyeom
we're talking about.

00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:43.285
You're really going to accept help
from a murderer like him?

00:32:43.855 --> 00:32:46.795
Since when have you ever cared
who the defendant is?

00:32:47.595 --> 00:32:50.265
You just need a high-profile case
to make a name for yourself.

00:32:51.435 --> 00:32:52.635
And what's wrong with that?

00:32:52.635 --> 00:32:54.305
Don't use Lee Woo Gyeom's
death sentence...

00:32:55.965 --> 00:32:58.405
as a stepping stone for your career.

00:32:59.305 --> 00:33:02.475
You can reach your goals
without Lee Woo Gyeom, but I...

00:33:03.905 --> 00:33:05.815
I need him right now.

00:33:06.715 --> 00:33:10.345
You think Lee Woo Gyeom
is really going to cure Min Seo?

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:12.285
What if he's lying?

00:33:12.815 --> 00:33:14.885
There's no guarantee
the treatment will even work.

00:33:16.085 --> 00:33:19.125
That's why I'm saying we should find
a legitimate way to do this.

00:33:19.825 --> 00:33:21.725
I'll help in any way I can.

00:33:22.095 --> 00:33:25.395
If you need money for the treatment...
I know you won't like this, but...

00:33:25.465 --> 00:33:26.465
Yi Yeon.

00:33:30.805 --> 00:33:32.005
That's enough.

00:33:36.545 --> 00:33:37.715
I'll see you in court.

00:33:38.145 --> 00:33:40.715
You know this is wrong.

00:33:41.345 --> 00:33:43.715
Why are you giving
a guy like that a chance?

00:33:44.885 --> 00:33:48.125
- Let me help you get the treatment.
- That's not what this is about, darn it!

00:33:49.585 --> 00:33:51.095
If it was something
a treatment could solve,

00:33:51.755 --> 00:33:53.125
I wouldn't have gone this far.

00:33:54.295 --> 00:33:56.095
I look at that jerk, Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:33:57.495 --> 00:33:59.335
and I second-guess myself
hundreds of times a day.

00:34:00.395 --> 00:34:03.035
I told myself I'd rather die
than defend that monster.

00:34:05.175 --> 00:34:06.735
But then... My daughter, Min Seo...

00:34:08.405 --> 00:34:09.845
is really dying.

00:34:11.515 --> 00:34:13.975
They said she could die any second,
not tomorrow, but right now.

00:34:15.615 --> 00:34:17.285
That was a wake-up call for me.

00:34:18.715 --> 00:34:20.855
I realized what I've been living
for all this time.

00:34:23.955 --> 00:34:24.955
I...

00:34:26.095 --> 00:34:28.095
don't care about anything else
in this world...

00:34:28.865 --> 00:34:30.425
except for getting my Min Seo treated.

00:34:31.395 --> 00:34:32.935
Even if this is the wrong choice,

00:34:34.065 --> 00:34:36.005
I would make it all over again.

00:34:37.405 --> 00:34:38.405
Understand?

00:34:42.905 --> 00:34:43.905
Han Jun...

00:34:52.255 --> 00:34:53.255
Yi Yeon.

00:34:56.055 --> 00:34:58.195
Then all you have to do
is beat me in court.

00:35:08.065 --> 00:35:09.065
To be honest,

00:35:12.405 --> 00:35:14.445
I'd rather you win.

00:35:34.165 --> 00:35:36.165

00:36:16.305 --> 00:36:20.135
They'll announce the recipients soon.
So let's just wait a little longer.

Mr. Jo.

00:36:36.455 --> 00:36:38.855
- Hey. Thank you.
- Careful, it's hot.

00:36:40.225 --> 00:36:42.395
Now all that's left is selecting
the participant for the demonstration.

00:36:43.665 --> 00:36:45.195
You think the attorney's going to be okay?

00:36:46.095 --> 00:36:49.665
He must have mixed feelings.
He's probably getting his hopes up.

00:36:50.565 --> 00:36:51.575
Goodness.

00:36:53.005 --> 00:36:54.805
It still doesn't feel real to me.

00:36:55.245 --> 00:36:56.245
What doesn't?

00:36:56.505 --> 00:36:58.375
That an incurable disease
can actually be cured.

00:37:01.045 --> 00:37:03.785
It's not just you.
The whole world feels that way.

00:37:04.355 --> 00:37:08.525
Inventions and discoveries have never been
welcomed with open arms in human history.

00:37:09.085 --> 00:37:11.155
The Earth's rotation and revolution,

00:37:11.425 --> 00:37:15.625
the law of universal gravitation,
the discovery of the New World...

00:37:17.225 --> 00:37:20.635
Do you think people will come
to accept this over time?

00:37:21.405 --> 00:37:22.435
I wonder.

00:37:22.965 --> 00:37:23.965
I hope so.

00:37:26.075 --> 00:37:27.075
No.

00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:30.375
They have to.

00:37:36.315 --> 00:37:38.985
We're hearing that the patient
for the demo will be selected today.

00:37:39.185 --> 00:37:43.555
Reports say Lee Woo Gyeom's lawyer's child
is a top choice.

00:37:44.125 --> 00:37:47.325
That choice makes sense, and it's likely
why he took the case in the first place.

00:37:47.765 --> 00:37:51.335
Right. Being first brings pressure
and the risks involved.

00:37:56.765 --> 00:37:58.175

Regarding the selection...

She wasn't selected for the demonstration.

00:38:25.395 --> 00:38:26.665
Jae Hee, I'm so sorry.

00:38:27.765 --> 00:38:29.105
It's all my fault.

00:38:29.905 --> 00:38:30.905
I see.

00:38:31.405 --> 00:38:35.205
- There are so many.
- A ton! Let's go check it out.

00:38:35.275 --> 00:38:36.405
- Ji Yeon.
- Let's go.

00:38:36.475 --> 00:38:37.545

00:38:38.515 --> 00:38:39.945

- Bye!

- Lee Woo Gyeom, who is on trial,

- Execute him!
- will operate on the dying Choi Woo Jin.

00:39:28.695 --> 00:39:29.925
- That monster...
- As he prepares for the procedure,

00:39:29.995 --> 00:39:31.965
- Execute him!
- the question of its success...

00:39:31.965 --> 00:39:33.095
- Execute him!
- has captured the nation's attention.

00:39:33.165 --> 00:39:34.165
- Lee Woo Gyeom...
- He's here.

00:39:34.235 --> 00:39:36.805
- Lee Woo Gyeom is a murderer!
- Murderer!

00:39:36.865 --> 00:39:38.205
Murderer!

00:39:38.505 --> 00:39:41.035
- Execute him!
- Execute him!

00:39:41.105 --> 00:39:44.475
- Execute him!
- He's in there!

00:39:44.615 --> 00:39:46.675

It was a conflict of interest, right?
Her father's defending Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:12.765
But it's not like the procedure
is a guaranteed success.

00:41:12.835 --> 00:41:14.165

Exactly.

00:41:21.375 --> 00:41:24.245
And the attorney was so hopeful too.

00:41:24.245 --> 00:41:28.285
And the nation is watching closely
to see if a cure is truly possible.

00:41:30.145 --> 00:41:31.185
Come watch this.

00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:34.055
Who did they pick to be the patient
for this demonstration?

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.425
They said they selected
a child with severe cancer.

00:41:40.855 --> 00:41:43.025
Lee Woo Gyeom, follow me.

00:41:48.005 --> 00:41:50.235
(Changing Room)

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.615
(Angiography Room)

00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:35.685
As of this moment,

00:42:36.445 --> 00:42:39.585
we will commence the medical demonstration
by the defendant, Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:42:40.185 --> 00:42:42.355
Defendant, are you ready?

00:42:42.725 --> 00:42:44.425
Yes, I'm ready.

00:42:44.955 --> 00:42:47.855
Then you may begin
the medical demonstration.

00:43:42.645 --> 00:43:45.385
We're being told that court officials
have now exited the room.

00:43:45.755 --> 00:43:49.425
The question is if the patient recovers
within 24 hours, as the accused claimed.

00:43:49.625 --> 00:43:52.195
The on-site medical team
is monitoring the situation.

00:44:05.305 --> 00:44:06.305
What?

00:44:15.085 --> 00:44:16.285
It's just a spam call.

00:44:19.955 --> 00:44:21.985
Why aren't I getting any calls? Seriously.

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:08.665
Prosecutor Cha, I found prints on the pipe
in that building and ran them.

00:45:09.035 --> 00:45:11.365
We got a hit.
The guy was already in our database.

00:45:11.435 --> 00:45:13.105
(Criminal Record Inquiry Report,

(Fatal assault, fraud,
intimidation, extortion)

00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:22.145
He killed someone
and only got a suspended sentence?

00:45:29.425 --> 00:45:31.255
(Sentence)

00:45:31.325 --> 00:45:33.455
To kill someone so brutally...

00:45:33.525 --> 00:45:35.225
(The assault resulted
in the victim's death.)

00:45:37.495 --> 00:45:38.865

to 2 years in prison)

00:45:38.935 --> 00:45:41.135

will be suspended for 4 years)

(Prosecutor: Oh Hyeon Deuk)

00:45:51.945 --> 00:45:53.245
A medical demonstration?

00:45:54.215 --> 00:45:55.445
What is this crap?

00:46:05.925 --> 00:46:07.095
(Prosecution case inquiry)

The source isn't important.

00:46:28.215 --> 00:46:29.915
What matters is that before you knew,

00:46:30.315 --> 00:46:34.415
someone had already
finished their business...

00:46:34.415 --> 00:46:35.525
concerning Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:46:35.925 --> 00:46:37.255
What are you implying?

00:46:37.685 --> 00:46:39.495
It means if you dig too deep,

00:46:40.255 --> 00:46:43.425
you could get hurt, Prosecutor.

00:46:49.035 --> 00:46:51.775

Woo Jin, can you see Daddy?

00:47:25.835 --> 00:47:29.145

No, I didn't order anything.
