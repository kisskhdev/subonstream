[THE DEVIL BETWEEN US]

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
[Episode 5]

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.640
Who are you?

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.400
Don't move.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.710
Narcotics Unit.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.600
Come here.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.870
Wang An.

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.590
Come.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.790
We need to talk.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:07.040
Take his bag off first.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.480
Bag.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.230
Trying to run?

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.840
Where can you go?

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.630
If we didn't have solid proof,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.430
would we be here looking for you?

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.390
We waited until after class to talk

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.940
so you'd have some privacy.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.290
Listen to me.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.329
Making a mistake isn't terrible.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.220
What's terrible is repeating it.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.760
Am I being clear enough?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.470
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.270
When did you start taking drugs?

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.310
What drugs?

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.310
Your sister

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.590
ate what you left at home

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.190
and was sent to the hospital.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.460
Playing dumb, are you?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.840
You're an adult.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.440
Don't you know if it's drugs?

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.700
So, you wanna talk here,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.420
or back at the station?

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.630
Take him away.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.240
Let's go.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.730
I don't know anything!

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:56.120
Listen,

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:57.590
when he gave it to me,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.050
I didn't know it was drugs.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.590
And I only took it twice.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.120
You can't blame me for ignorance.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.450
I swear, I knew nothing.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.780
Really.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.440
Who sold you the drugs?

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.780
My gear sucks. I can't win.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:15.150
Speak up.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:17.400
What are you doing?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.120
Tang Sile.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.310
Where are you going?

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.120
Excuse me!

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.910
Move!

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:25.750
Coming through!

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.360
Move!

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.230
Stop!

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.040
Out of the way!

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.910
Move!

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.890
Move!

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.430
Move!

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.430
Make way!

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.710
Move!

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:41.590
Move!

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.470
Out of the way!

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.590
Move!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.840
Move!

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.680
Move!

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.470
Move!

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.270
Out of the way!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.680
Excuse me!

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:51.190
Move!

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.840
Excuse me!

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:52.630
Excuse me!

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.280
Move!

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280
Get out of the way!

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.630
Watch out!

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.310
My balls!

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.400
Move!

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.250
Coming through!

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.760
Run?

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.650
Still running?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.600
Qin!

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:25.600
Calm down.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.730
Don't be impulsive.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.360
Get down!

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.750
I'm telling you,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.240
don't do anything rash.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.950
Don't come up!

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.800
I'm telling you!

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:30.120
Calm down!

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.870
Get down now!

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:31.480
Calm down!

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.270
Get down!

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.920
Watch out.

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.480
Don't come up!

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.600
Qin, be careful!

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.270
What are you doing?

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.240
Trying to toss the drugs?

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.190
I'm telling you,

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:39.830
no matter where you dump the drugs,

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.950
we'll find them.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.800
Qin!

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.270
Qin!

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.390
Let me see.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.040
Let me see.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.920
Don't cover it.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.830
Don't cover it!

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.490
Don't move!

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.540
Call an ambulance!

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.210
I called.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.070
Qin!

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:09.950
It's okay.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.560
Don't move.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.390
Where is he?

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.620
Up there.

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.800
Youth Center rooftop. Hurry!

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.130
Call an ambulance! Now!

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.390
Hu Wenjing!

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.750
It's okay, Qin.

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:24.390
It's okay.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.500
Here's what you do.

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:28.300
If the cops spot you,

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.270
eat all these pills

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.470
before they grab you.

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.600
No evidence, no crime.

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.990
Won't I die if I eat that many at once?

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.110
You won't die.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.580
Raw materials are so expensive now.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.640
How much could they even put in these?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.280
Director Liu,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.560
Qin Ke has been rushed

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.020
to Meizhou No. 2 Hospital.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.340
The young drug dealer is dead.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.160
Okay.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.430
I'm hanging up now.

00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.090
Got something to handle here.

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:33.080
Everyone, settle down!

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.350
Settle down!

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.600
Listen to me.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.000
Listen to me!

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.090
Why did you arrest my child?

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.390
Yeah, what did our kids do?

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.030
Why are you holding them?

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:40.840
Let me explain.

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.360
We just asked the kids

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.000
to come in and help with some inquiries.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.630
Once we clear things up,

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.510
those who are innocent

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:47.720
can leave anytime.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:48.340
Officer,

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.720
can we at least

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.630
see our kids?

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:51.270
Yeah!

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.240
You police
have to follow the law too, don't you?

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.720
How are we not following the law?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.640
Quiet!

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.130
You're all educated people.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:04.790
What kind of place is this?

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:05.720
Is it appropriate to make a scene here?

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:06.440
Is it?

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.190
You keep saying they're kids,

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:11.900
but they're adults in their twenties.

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.620
With what happened
at the test prep center,

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.820
don't you want to get to the bottom of it?

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.260
All this noise won't help.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.510
I've said it already.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:21.600
We'll investigate as soon as possible.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.190
Those involved won't get away

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.310
with anything.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.110
And the innocent ones?
We won't keep them a second longer.

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:28.550
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.950
Don't crowd around here.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.460
I'll go push things along.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.300
Appreciate your cooperation.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:34.060
Alright?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:37.970
[Monitoring Query Room]

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.630
Tang Sile

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.370
tried to sell me some
brain-boosting candy.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.050
He said his grades improved
just by eating this candy.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:48.560
So I asked about the price.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.150
Good lord.

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.120
One hundred for one piece of candy.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.720
I can't even afford one
on my daily meal budget.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:56.910
Of course I didn't buy any.

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.200
But I know a few guys

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.200
in our class are pretty close to him.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.720
Which ones?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.450
Could you provide their names?

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.360
That doesn't seem right.

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.750
Don't worry about that.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:09.550
We will definitely keep it confidential.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.720
No one will know

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:11.750
that you told us.

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.150
He kept telling everyone in class

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:17.150
that this thing

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.930
can improve academic grades.

00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:20.070
He even

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.950
begged me

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.880
to arrange a few more quizzes for them.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.380
He would memorize the answers beforehand.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.560
That way,

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.230
it would look like
his grades were constantly improving.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.430
So you helped a drug dealer scam people?

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:34.830
Some teacher you are.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.090
I was blinded by greed for a moment

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:38.880
and fell for Tang Sile's trick.

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:40.720
Can you keep this secret for me?

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.960
Don't tell my family,

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.280
especially my daughter.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.240
If she finds out,

00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.670
how can I face anyone?

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:48.390
How can I be her father?

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.240
Last night was the second time.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.560
Tang Sile and I

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.890
met at the entrance of Mix Club.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.300
How many pieces did you buy this time?

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.280
He had five pieces in total.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.460
I bought them all.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:05.570
These five pieces you bought,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:06.970
what did you do with them?

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.360
I ate one.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:11.070
Three were at home.

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.360
And the left one

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.050
was the one you found on me.

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.350
Your sister accidentally ate two.

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.080
Where did the remaining one go?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:23.730
I don't know.

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:26.540
I put them all in the pen holder.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.210
I don't even know how my sister ate them.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.060
Do you know where Tang Sile got his stock?

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:37.720
No.

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.320
He didn't tell me,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:41.640
and I didn't ask.

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:50.000
Jin,

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:51.390
how's the interrogation going?

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.320
We'll let them go
after recording their statements.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.320
Release the innocent kids immediately.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.940
Having parents
blocking the door is troublesome.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:11:59.670
Okay. Got it.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:01.090
Hurry up.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.190
I found something.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:04.150
Come take a look.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.740
Let's go.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.960
When we caught Tang Sile today,

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.910
I thought he looked familiar.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.150
So I checked
the surveillance footage again.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.840
Look here.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.750
This is the bar entrance.

00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:25.530
That's him, right?

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.410
Let me zoom in for you.

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.690
That's him, right?

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.940
Look, this was last night.

00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:34.200
That's him too, right?

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:36.720
He was always hanging
around this bar entrance.

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.510
There's definitely
something wrong with this bar.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.370
It's possible.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.320
Wang An said

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.510
that after he traded
with Tang Sile yesterday,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.720
he was out of stock.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:46.270
But Tang Sile died of an overdose today.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:47.960
Based on the wrappers at the scene,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.870
he had at least a dozen units of drugs.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.790
We also found

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:52.080
twenty units in his home.

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:54.150
This means after their deal yesterday,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:55.080
Tang Sile definitely

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.880
went to his supplier to restock.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.390
Right.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:59.510
And another drug user named Liu Qiang

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.110
also comes to this bar often.

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.840
See, Liu Qiang is connected to this bar.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.670
Tang Sile is connected to it too.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.790
So I have reasonable suspicion

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.030
that there is a problem with this bar.

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.430
Give me a search warrant.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.720
Without evidence,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.320
you can't just raid a place.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.440
Didn't the Public Security Brigade

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.960
catch someone in the bar

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.540
carrying date-rape drugs?

00:13:17.570 --> 00:13:17.980
Yes.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.910
We'll use that as grounds
to apply for a search warrant.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:20.970
Is there a problem?

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:22.580
That could work.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.360
But the Municipal Narcotics Unit
has too many cases

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:26.870
and not enough manpower.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:29.010
It would be best if your unit sent people.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:30.670
It's perfectly justifiable.

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:32.490
Director Dai.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:33.090
What is it?

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.480
Well,

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.360
Tang Sile's mother

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.080
revealed important information.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.120
She said she was overworked before,

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.360
and on a colleague's recommendation,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.550
she took a drug for treating ADHD

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:44.750
smuggled from Korea.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:45.750
Healthy people who take this drug

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.120
get very hyper.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.790
She thought it worked great at first,

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:50.440
so she got Tang Sile to take it too.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.870
Later, her mental state got worse
the more she took.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:52.870
She felt something was wrong,

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.730
and it took a lot of effort to quit.

00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:56.390
She didn't let Tang Sile
take it anymore either.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:13:58.270
But she didn't know
that after stopping it,

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.360
Tang Sile actually started using drugs.

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.920
She knew even less about
him dealing to support his habit.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.320
Did she say where she bought the drugs?

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:03.930
Yes.

00:14:04.250 --> 00:14:05.310
Nuan'an Pharmacy.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:07.610
The pharmacy sells banned drugs.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:08.630
But Tang Sile's drugs

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:10.000
weren't necessarily bought there.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.480
I think the problem lies with the bar.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.270
Agreed.

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:13.770
The bar is suspicious.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:17.550
Alright.

00:14:18.830 --> 00:14:19.510
Hu Wenjing,

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.720
take Team One

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.570
to the bar.

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:23.240
Also search the bar owner

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.900
Yu Qing's private residence.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:25.600
If anything goes wrong,

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.360
I'll take responsibility.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.790
No problem.

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:27.360
Go.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.490
Tan Jie,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.160
take Team Two

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.720
and assist Jin Longzheng

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:33.080
to raid the pharmacy.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:49.670
Hello.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:50.240
Hello.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:51.220
Narcotics Unit.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.920
Here's the search warrant.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:04.640
What's this?

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:07.120
And this?

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.720
You're back.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.540
How was your chat with your cop friends?

00:15:26.670 --> 00:15:27.330
It was fine.

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:29.010
Just eating and drinking.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.910
Nothing special.

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:36.560
Since when do you play video games?

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.120
I'm not playing.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:39.510
I meet them

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.150
in this game and communicate

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.510
using code words.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.080
Look.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:45.170
This guy...

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:47.010
is called Quan.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.580
I set up a meet with Quan

00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:53.810
in four days.

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.290
I also booked a boat.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.080
If he turns on me,

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.030
I'll kill him,

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:59.120
take his money,

00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:01.830
and set sail immediately.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.630
He must have made a lot recently.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.270
Enough for us to live it up for a while.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:16.920
We're leaving

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.070
in four days?

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:19.640
That soon?

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.390
I said "if."

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.040
But knowing Quan,

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:26.960
I'm 80% sure

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.420
I can convince him to work with me.

00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:31.140
In that case,

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.430
we can stay in Nuanhai

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:33.550
for a while longer.

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:35.590
What if he

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.120
put all the money in the bank?

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:39.780
We are drug dealers.

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.610
Why would we put money in a bank?

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:49.440
I'm not ready to go abroad.

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:53.080
You don't have to go.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.270
When you get caught,

00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:57.070
I'll pray for you

00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:58.500
at Wat Pho.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960
I fixed it for you.

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:12.869
I can't believe

00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.710
you kept a cheap 200-yuan gadget

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.180
for so many years.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:31.810
It's ugly.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:40.640
Is it?

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.970
[Nuanfeng Hengke Electronics Co., Ltd.]

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:04.140
Cheng Ken.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.510
Get in.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.880
We've met before.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:22.790
You probably forgot.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.790
Really?

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.350
There are too many people at the factory.

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.350
I don't remember.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.920
Our factory is huge.

00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:38.150
Many families depend on it
for their livelihood.

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.690
Some work honestly.

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.000
And some are like us,

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:44.720
using certain methods.

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:46.960
Everyone uses their own skills.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.860
So you need to understand,

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.060
we're not acting alone.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:53.130
And what we're discussing

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.740
isn't just about one or two invoices.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.280
That's exactly why I came to you.

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:03.950
I'm not here to cut off anyone's income.

00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.720
I...

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.000
I just want...

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.330
To get a piece of the pie?

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:16.640
I don't know if Mr. Sun

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.240
told you about my situation.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.310
My parents are gone. My wife too.

00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:24.990
It's just me and my daughter now.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.790
My daughter has uremia.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:29.230
I need money to save her.

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.790
I make 3,800 a month.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.740
It's not enough.

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:34.590
What's that got to do with me?

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.050
And why should I?

00:19:38.170 --> 00:19:40.700
Just because you're
the factory accountant?

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.730
Wouldn't it be easier for me
to go straight to Mr. Sun?

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.750
Sure, that would work.

00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.360
But the premise is...

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:00.860
no one reports you.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.720
Are you blackmailing me?

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.920
Ever been to this river?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:27.080
No.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.270
Believe it or not,

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.010
I'll throw you in right now.

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:36.930
I believe you.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.630
But when I got in your car just now,

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:43.090
the factory cameras

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.250
probably caught it.

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.550
If I drown,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.360
you pay with your life.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:51.030
If I half-drown, you pay cash.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.890
You really are going for broke.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:04.310
Fine.

00:21:06.330 --> 00:21:07.760
I underestimated you.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.990
12,000.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:32.290
Is that enough?

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.200
I'll pay you 12,000 a month from now on.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:39.610
I don't need

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:41.460
to teach you what to do, right?

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.090
No need.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.630

Yes.

Well,

there's only one camera
at a nearby intersection.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.240

passing back and forth.

Just one camera?

You know the camera coverage
in our county.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.510
I have to say,
this guy is really something.

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.310
He had the guts to kill himself,

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.440
but not to face the law.

00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.440
Now that he's dead, the lead is gone.

Really?

Maybe.

He said you were guessing blindly.

Let him talk.

I arrested you the other day.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:20.210
It was a misunderstanding.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.770
So I came to apologize.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.240
You must be joking.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.000
You work for the government.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.400
How can you apologize
to common folks like us?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:28.550
Listen to you.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:29.000
You still...

have a grudge against us.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.030
Then I didn't come for nothing.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:31.790
No grudge.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:33.750
Really, no grudge at all.

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:35.410
You said it was a misunderstanding.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:36.610
Let's just let it go.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:38.480
Well, first time strangers,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.510

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.190
It's good.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:41.400
I...

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.270
I've got stuff today.

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:44.160
Let's talk some other time.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:44.960
I'll see you out.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.030
What is it?

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.110
I...

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:48.070
I have to take

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:49.200
the kid out later.

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.750
I came just to see the kid.

00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:51.640
The other day at the station,

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.440
you mentioned your family situation.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.770
Your daughter is called...

00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:55.830
Jiajia.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.030
Right? I remember it.

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.680
These fruits are for Jiajia.

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:01.170
When I heard what you're going through,

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:02.230
it really moved me.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.050
Really.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.350
You've had it so tough.

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.830
I'm used to it.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.680
It's fine.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:08.680
Another time. You're busy too.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.200
Let's just...

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.350
No, I'll just see the kid.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.280
I'll leave right after seeing her.

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:20.100
Now's not

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.730
really a good time.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.280
Why not?

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.880
Well,

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.200
I'll just see the kid and leave.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.240
It's not that it's inconvenient at home.

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.970
It's just...

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.200
we have an appointment.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.160
I'll go up and get her,

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.820
then take her to the hospital.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.590
That's perfect.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.720
I'm heading back to the station.
It's on the way.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:34.920
You can give me a ride.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.720
Your station is quite

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:37.830
far from the hospital.

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.550
It's not that far.

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.160
I'll walk from there.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.420
Consider it exercise.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:41.880
Look,

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.720
I took time off work and bought fruit.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.110
You wouldn't mind
giving me a lift, would you?

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:46.070
No.

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:47.980
I wouldn't mind.

00:26:50.030 --> 00:26:50.240
Tell you what.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:50.550
I...

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:51.070
Fine.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:51.680
I...

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.160
I'll go up, get the kid,
and come right down.

00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:53.480
Okay?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:53.790
It's fine.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:54.920
I'll go up with you.

00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.510
I'll be right back down.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.240
I want to see where you live,

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.640
so I can visit more often.

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:02.190
Alright.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:03.580
Might as well.

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:04.070
Right?

00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:04.590
Let me do it.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.160
It's fine.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.440
I got it.

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.240
Go ahead.

Change your shoes.
We're going to the hospital.

This is Uncle Jin.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:44.440
He's a police officer.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.310
Say hello to Uncle Jin.

Hello, Uncle Jin.

00:27:46.350 --> 00:27:47.210
Hello, Jiajia.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:48.270
I'll go get the bag.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:50.920
I'll get it.

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.540
Are you done changing?

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:03.640
Officer Jin,

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:06.520
just put the fruit on the coffee table.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.310
Okay.

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.350
Let's go. Hurry.

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.880
We don't have much time.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.350
I put it here.

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.880
Okay.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.960
Thanks.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.240
What about this?

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.250
I'll deal with it when I get back.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:14.860
Thank you.

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.120
Let's go, Officer Jin.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:22.470
Slow down, Jiajia.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:34.920
Jiajia,

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:37.950
doesn't your dad work hard
taking care of you?

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.640
Dad gets up in the morning
to make me breakfast,

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:43.240
then he goes to work.

00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:45.630
At night, he makes me dinner,

00:28:46.170 --> 00:28:47.130
plays with me,

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.000
tells me stories,

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.440
puts me to sleep.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.880
And he takes me to the hospital a lot.

00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:54.200
Then your dad

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:56.200
doesn't have any time to rest at all?

00:28:57.670 --> 00:28:59.360
If I wasn't sick,

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:02.230
Dad wouldn't have to work so hard.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:05.030
It's okay, Jiajia.

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:06.930
You

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:08.330
will get better soon.

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:13.240
I don't know much about this.

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:16.000
Is the local hospital
capable of doing a kidney transplant?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.810
Yes.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.630
I'm seeing Director Song at the hospital.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.440
He is an expert in this field,

00:29:21.460 --> 00:29:22.260
an authority.

00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:24.200
He said he's confident

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.540
about the surgery.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.070
It's not that difficult.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:27.730
I trust him.

00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.120
What about the money?

00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:32.060
The cost.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.430
I know.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.310
The surgery costs 200,000.

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.480
The medication after surgery

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:40.720
and nutritional supplements

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.070
cost 100,000 a year.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:44.660
Jiajia,

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.730
do you know how much 200,000 is?

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.600
I know.

00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.480
A bag of rice crackers is 10 yuan.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:51.860
200,000 can buy 20,000 bags.

00:29:51.890 --> 00:29:53.950
I couldn't finish them in a lifetime.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.960
How are you so smart,

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.670
Jiajia?

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:13.910
How are you doing with raising the money?

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.870
Money?

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.160
For the surgery fee,

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.170
I've scraped it together now.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.210
As long as there's a suitable kidney,

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:23.990
the operation
can be performed at any time.

00:30:23.990 --> 00:30:24.900
Jiajia is currently

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.630
at the top of the hospital's
kidney waiting list.

00:30:28.250 --> 00:30:29.370
We just have to wait.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.070
Fortunately,
regarding her current condition,

00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:32.130
Director Song says

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:32.800
it's okay.

00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:34.360
She can hold on a bit longer.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.380
It's just the money for the kidney.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:39.830
I haven't raised enough.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.160
Still short quite a bit.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.670
I'm thinking of picking up

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:45.690
another night shift soon.

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:48.160
Every little bit helps.

00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.870
Ken.

00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:06.220
Let me give you a word of advice.

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:09.450
I know you're under a lot of pressure,

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.910
but never touch things
you shouldn't touch.

00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:14.240
Your family relies
entirely on you right now.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.840
If something happens to you,

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.500
who will take care of Jiajia?

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.070
Right?

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.330
Right.

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:20.970
I'll remember that.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.280
Can we go play with Jiang later?

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:32.300
Sure.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:34.750
I'll take you there when we're done.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.300
Please wait outside.

00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:38.800
Okay.

00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:42.830
Jiajia, put your hand here.

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.460
How many times a week does she come?

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.200
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays.

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.040
Three times.

00:31:58.510 --> 00:32:00.040
You should get back to work.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.120
Thanks for coming to see her.

00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:05.550
Alright.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.000
See you another time.

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:09.180
Take care.

00:32:09.330 --> 00:32:09.990
No problem.

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.220
My silent, stern father,

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:34.880
how I cannot bear to see—

00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.830
your disappointing son

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:38.610
has left your temples frosted

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.080
like snow.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:42.960
The strength in your back I once knew,

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.220
now lives only in my memory.

00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:48.580
Your eyes once held hope,

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:51.960
while I lost myself in my own youth.

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:53.920
Father,

00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.510
tonight's starry sky

00:32:57.260 --> 00:32:59.350
reflects the regret in my heart.

00:33:00.630 --> 00:33:01.690
Please believe me.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:05.110
I wish to repay you with action.

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:07.320
In your twilight years,

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.350
I will give you more company

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:11.240
and care.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.880
Actually, when I recited this poem,

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.650
I was really thinking about my sister.

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:35.890
Our parents died when we were young.

00:33:36.790 --> 00:33:39.030
My sister raised me all by herself.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.330
She was both a father and a mother to me.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:48.090
My sister never actually used drugs.

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.200
She just accidentally ate

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.440
what I left behind.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:54.820
She didn't even need to be here.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.670
But she came anyway,

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.040
to support me

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.960
and join me in every rehab session.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:10.400
Ping,

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:17.620
I'm grateful for everything
you've done for me.

00:34:18.989 --> 00:34:20.239
I promise you,

00:34:21.130 --> 00:34:23.090
I will work hard to quit

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:24.670
and never relapse.

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:35.219
Don't worry.

00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.590
I only took it by mistake this one time.

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:38.400
The dose was small.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.670
I won't get addicted.

00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:41.469
The doctor already told me

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.610
I only need to come once a week now.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.440
Just check-ups,

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.480
to monitor my recovery.

00:34:46.679 --> 00:34:47.630
How's Wang An?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.150
He's doing okay too.

00:34:49.590 --> 00:34:51.679
He was terrified when he first got here.

00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.400
He thought it would be
some kind of hellhole.

00:34:54.650 --> 00:34:56.530
But to his surprise,

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.350
the staff here have been nice to him.

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:00.860
He's calmed down a lot.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.310
Here,

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.950
besides the treatment,

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.470
we have support groups,

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.880
attend classes,

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.360
and do some light work.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:11.230
Overall, it's not bad.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.730
So the treatment's going smoothly?

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:15.080
Pretty smoothly.

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:16.960
Wang An's condition

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:18.120
is relatively mild.

00:35:18.530 --> 00:35:19.710
He isn't one of those people

00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:21.030
inside who are

00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.960
in desperate agony.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.480
But the doctor told us,

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.290
after taking this drug,

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:26.050
the physical

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:28.550
dependence is not strong,

00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:30.650
but the psychological dependence is huge.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.510
Look, I only took it by mistake once,

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.200
right?

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:34.970
I feel like

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:36.920
I don't have any particular

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:38.360
physical discomfort.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:41.510
But sometimes my mind keeps thinking about

00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:43.110
that feeling I had back then.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:45.600
That's because you took a small dose.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.860
Otherwise, your body
wouldn't have been able to handle it.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:52.170
[Nuanfeng County
Public Security Bureau Committee]

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.270
Officer Zhang.

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.080
Li Xiaoya?

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:23.010
You head back first.

00:36:23.490 --> 00:36:24.320
Look who's here.

00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:25.740
What, here to see Wenjing?

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.630
I was just passing by,

00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.620
so I thought I'd drop in.

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:28.390
Is she in?

00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:31.030
I think she went to the city.

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.630
She should be back soon.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.800
Why don't you wait inside?

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.890
No need.

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:37.450
I'll just wait for her here.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:40.020
You look sharp again.

00:36:40.770 --> 00:36:41.530
Do I?

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.030
What are you busy with?

00:36:44.030 --> 00:36:44.840
Nothing much.

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.550
Just routine work.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:50.320
There was a student trafficking drugs,

00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:50.920
right?

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:51.920
Yes.

00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:53.010
I heard about it.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.070
The pharmacy was investigated.

00:36:55.070 --> 00:36:56.790
I used to buy meds there all the time.

00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:57.620
It's so scary.

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.440
How could there be drug dealers?

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.910
Don't stress about it.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:02.460
That pharmacy wasn't trafficking drugs.

00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:04.010
They were just selling some smuggled,

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:04.760
unapproved meds.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.280
We've already issued a public notice.

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.000
What meds?

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:08.860
I don't understand that.

00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:10.120
But I just want to know,

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.850
did you catch the drug dealer?

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.100
For people like us in business,

00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.180
social stability is everything.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:21.940
One little ripple,

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.320
and it hits us hard.

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:24.750
You have to trust the police.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:26.840
We'll clean up all this trash eventually.

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.640
I do trust you.

00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:29.760
Why else would I
be this close with Wenjing?

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:30.710
Thank you, Officer Zhang.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:31.320
You're so nice

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:32.400
for telling me all this.

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.930
Let's grab a meal sometime.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.320
Sure.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.440
No problem.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:38.230
Why not today?

00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.960
Let's do it.

00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:41.520
Wait for me to get off work.
We'll find a place.

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.880
Today?

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.360
I'm really busy today.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.960
I just wanted to drop by and see her.

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.230
She...

00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:51.400
won't be back for a while, right?

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.000
I won't wait for her.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:53.840
I'm leaving now.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.710
Let's eat together another time.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:55.150
Really.

00:37:55.150 --> 00:37:55.800
Okay.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.860
Another time then.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:58.180
Looking sharp.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:58.840
Bye.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.480
Bye.

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.640
Yeah, sharp.

00:38:22.750 --> 00:38:23.480
Take it easy.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.080
Slow down.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:25.910
Easy.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.220
Jiajia's here.

00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:30.140
I've been waiting for you for days.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.060
My dad bought me a new board game.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:33.660
He can get out of bed now?

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.290
The doctor said
the lung infection is much better.

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:38.190
And...

00:38:38.590 --> 00:38:39.390
he can eat now.

00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:40.420
It's a good sign.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:41.590
Good sign.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.170
Did they find a specific drug?

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:43.900
No.

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:45.740
It's just the same meds as always.

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.260
Probably his immunity kicking in.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.040
Her mom praying everywhere
probably helped too.

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:51.880
Sincerity works wonders.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.400
Right?

00:38:52.710 --> 00:38:53.710
This donor you found

00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:55.550
actually matches your daughter's
white blood cell antibody

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:56.750
at six sites exactly.

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.450
That's incredibly rare.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.600
It works.

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:02.070
It works.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:03.940
He'll be discharged soon, right?

00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:05.360
We have to listen to the doctor.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.760
They said at this rate,

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:08.280
it should be soon.

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.030
That's good.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:12.290
Perseverance prevails.

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:12.860
Right.

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.130
Jiajia is doing well, right?

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:16.860
Pretty good.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.810
She's okay.

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.800
I didn't expect this.

00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.670
It's a good thing.

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:28.480
Hi, Cheng Ken.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.150
Hi.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:30.580
It's good.

00:39:30.930 --> 00:39:31.930
I'll walk around.

00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:33.900
Jiajia,

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.430
Jiang missed you so much.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.730
