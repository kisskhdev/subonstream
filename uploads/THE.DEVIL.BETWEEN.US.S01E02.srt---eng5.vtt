[THE DEVIL BETWEEN US]

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.030
[Episode 2]

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.229
Suspect: Ding Lai.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.070
Local of Haizhou.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.590
Drug dealer and fraudster.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.789
Forty-one years old.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.950
Liu Yi.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:58.710
From Qiongyang.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:59.870
Twenty-five years old.

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.950
He came to Haizhou
with his parents in 2013.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.210
Ding Lai's underling.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.170
Not long ago,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.640
we received intelligence
from the Municipal Narcotics Unit.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.840
Ding Lai, at an unknown location,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.680
obtained a batch of

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.960
a new hallucinogen
from an overseas laboratory.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.970
He mixed it into drinks
and snacks for sale,

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.300
and it sold out quickly.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.280
After this test run succeeded,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.750
he planned to restock.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:18.240
Three days ago,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.190
the two of them came
from the city to Nuanfeng County.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.710
Most of the time,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.640
they were under our surveillance.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.680
Only around 3 p.m.
the day before yesterday

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.490
did we lose track of Ding Lai
once at Nuanhai Square—

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.090
for no more than three hours.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.130
Hu Wenjing.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.520
Thirteen minutes before we arrived

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.710
at the Yuelai Hotel,

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.470
two suspicious individuals

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.630
left the hotel.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.480
It seemed a man had come
looking for someone in Room 401.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.680
One male,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.560
one female.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.560
The male:

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.200
about 1.78 meters tall,

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.230
average build,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.120
black top,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.710
black pants,

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:50.710
wearing a mask.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.710
As for

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.079
the female:

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.190
around 1.60 meters tall,

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.840
aged between 15 and 20,

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.190
long hair, slim build.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.000
I now suspect these two

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.520
are associates of Lv Deli.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.640
In Lv Deli's room,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.930
aside from a small amount of drugs,

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.360
we found a large quantity of laxatives.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.840
This matches what I heard Lv Deli say
in the restaurant earlier —

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.840
"Give me an hour,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.680
I'll make sure

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.470
she shits it out."

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.910
So I'm almost certain

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.810
he's using human body smuggling.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.310
The digestive cycle of a healthy adult

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.000
is 24 to 72 hours.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.800
If the drugs entered the body

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.120
and still hadn't been
expelled by this morning,

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.470
we can infer his time of entry

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.400
must not exceed 72 hours.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.300
Jiajia,

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.930
come.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.730
Take this to Xiaoyu.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.030
Ask her to change into these
clean clothes after her bath.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:39.400
So far the immigration office
has only found

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.960
Lv Deli's entry record.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.079
The girl in the footage

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:43.590
has no corresponding entry record—

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.840
very likely she was smuggled in
with someone else.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.910
We suspect this is

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.110
an organized cross-border
drug trafficking operation.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:10.730
Comrades,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.750
Comrade Jin Longfeng
from the Municipal Narcotics Unit

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.950
was tragically killed in this mission.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.370
We must turn our grief into strength.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.310
From now on,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.620
everyone must stay on high alert.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.240
Our county public security bureau

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.600
will fully cooperate with Comrade Wu Jun
of the Municipal Narcotics Unit.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.870
At present, some officers

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.120
have already been deployed to hospitals

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.230
and major traffic routes across the city.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.390
We'll strive to capture Ding Lai,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.550
Liu Yi,

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.159
and Lv Deli's two accomplices

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.310
within 24 hours.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.390
Dad, why do you
have to cut Xiaoyu's hair?

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:48.260
Because Uncle Tao's family
keeps their home very clean.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.070
If Xiaoyu

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.770
is going to stay there,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.610
she has to be clean too.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.750
Right?

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.070
Then when is Xiaoyu leaving?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.630
In a little while.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.670
Late tonight.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.380
Can I go with you to see her off?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:16.830
You are not going to sleep?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.540
No, I'm not.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.200
Xiaoyu, don't be scared.

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.720
Do you know what this is

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.470
wrapped around you?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.400
It's to keep your hair
from falling on you,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.560
so you don't get dirty.

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:34.560
Then do you know

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.630
what my dad is holding?

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.720
It's scissors.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:39.780
Snip. Snip.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.010
Invincible Wind Fire Wheels!

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.110
Got you!

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.490
Stop making noise.

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.800
Invincible Wind Fire Wheels!

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.280
I told you to stop it.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.080
Hello, Aunt Xiaoya.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.100
Go sit over there.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.880
Every time you come, you make a mess.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.770
Where's its head?

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:17.590
Who did this?

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.160
Speak up!

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.000
What's wrong?

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.690
What happened?

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.510
Why didn't you keep an eye on them?

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.940
They've broken my stuff.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:28.730
They're just kids.

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:30.490
If it's broken, just buy another one.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.980
How am I supposed to buy one?

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.870
That was a gift from a friend
when I was in college—

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:34.800
over 10 years ago.

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.530
Where would I even buy that now?

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.520
They're your good friend's kids.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.280
If it weren't because I like children,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.680
I wouldn't be helping you look after them.

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:48.370
Where's Xiaodong?

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.720
He went out.

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:56.560
Listen.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.409
Two more groups came
today asking for money.

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.830
Either you find a way to pay them back,

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.490
or you move out completely.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.320
Honey.

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.750
Next Monday at ten in the morning,

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.950
let's meet at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.560
Do we really have to come to this?

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:38.500
About the money—

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.950
I can help you solve it.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:40.760
I've told you,

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.159
it's not about the money.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.880
That's just small money.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.510
I can cover it with a little cash flow.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:47.159
I really can't stand this life anymore.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:47.800
I've had enough.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.460
I've had enough of your mom...

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:51.720
And of you.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:53.950
Mom's just getting old,

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.170
so she likes to nag.

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:56.360
Then we can move out.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.800
Wouldn't that solve everything?

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.390
This isn't about living arrangements.

00:07:59.390 --> 00:08:00.890
Why can't you understand?

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.720
What problem can't be solved?

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.390
I'll listen to you.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.120
I'll change.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.270
Cheng Xiaodong,
what are you even changing?

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.510
How many times have I told you?

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:10.270
You don't even understand what I'm saying.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:11.070
How are you going to change?

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.560
This is how I do things.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.430
Once I've made a decision,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:14.120
I don't waver.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:14.830
You know that too.

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:16.000
So stop dragging this out.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:16.960
Pack up my things,

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.890
hand them over to me,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:19.130
and we'll be done.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.130
Understand?

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.410
And one more thing—

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.140
don't ever come looking for me.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:30.880
Except at the Civil Affairs Bureau,

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.679
I don't want to see you anywhere.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.890
Hu Wenjing was on a mission.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.240
Why did she bring you along?

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:47.860
No,

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:49.560
Wenjing wasn't on duty today.

00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:50.720
Wasn't she on leave?

00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.220
The three of us planned
to go eat at Black Forest together.

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.300
When we first got to the restaurant,

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.790
Xiaoya thought a guy there
looked pretty handsome

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:00.620
and wanted us to go ask for his WeChat.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:01.460
But we never expected

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:03.680
that man turned out to be a drug dealer.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.300
Everything went chaotic in an instant.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.630
During the chase,

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.510
a police officer even died.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.440
Why did Li Xiaoya

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.370
insist on setting you up with a man?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:15.730
And besides,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.120
if something had happened to you,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:19.380
what would I have done?

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:31.800
Li Xiaoya has no sense of shame herself

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:33.480
and she insists on leading you astray.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.800
Don't talk about Xiaoya like that.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.480
I advise you to keep
your distance from her.

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.960
You're not the same kind of people.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.360
I really don't know how you two
ended up hanging out together.

00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:17.450
Xiaodong.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:17.870
You're here.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.670
I just finished up.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:19.960
Sorry I'm late.

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.270
They're both exhausted,

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:22.320
already asleep.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:25.280
Why are they sleeping so deeply?

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.210
Where's Xiaoya?

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.340
Li Xiaoya.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.200
Long time no see.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:52.470
So you're the drug dealer
the police are after.

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.310
I happened to see you at the café today,

00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.910
thought I'd come over to catch up.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.240
It's done.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:05.950
I've bandaged you up.

00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.490
You should leave now.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:10.600
I promise—

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.010
I absolutely won't call the police.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.190
I remember you married an honest man.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.170
How did your life become so miserable?

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.840
After all these years,

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.520
you're still the only woman

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.430
who can ignite passion in me.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.080
You have that fire inside,

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.600
nowhere to release it,

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:43.730
so you can only use it in bed.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.950
Get out!

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:46.250
Get out of here.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.870
If you drive me away now,

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.790
I'll have no way to survive.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.240
I don't mind

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.900
having someone accompany me

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:57.880
on the road to hell.

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:06.470
Li Xiaoya!

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.480
I know you're in there.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.870
Stop playing games with me.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:11.200
Debts must be paid.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.150
That's only natural.

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:13.550
You can't hide forever.

00:14:13.550 --> 00:14:14.880
Open the door right now!

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.330
Li Xiaoya!

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.990
Don't make me break it down.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:19.280
I'm telling you—

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:20.690
if I don't get the money today,

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:21.970
I'm not leaving.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.020
I'll stay right here

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.780
and see who lasts longer.

00:14:30.750 --> 00:14:31.930
How long to pick the lock?

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:32.730
Five minutes.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:34.080
Then hurry up.

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:56.430
The IOU.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:01.510
Here.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.400
Leave now.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.390
The money is real.

00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:13.460
Mine's real too. Hua.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:14.390
Then let's go.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:29.750
Xiaoya.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.660
No one knows about us.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:33.690
You're safe.

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.350
There are real feelings between us.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:41.010
As long as I get through this rough patch,

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:45.480
I'll take back everything
that belongs to me.

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:46.510
When that time comes,

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.610
whatever you want,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.590
I can give it all to you.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:56.520
When I first met you,

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.590
you were just a fraud
preaching success formulas.

00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.480
What now?

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.880
So you switched careers,

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:04.610
but you're still using
the same old routine?

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:06.700
Trying to sell me dreams again?

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.510
Are you scared

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.020
that after you fall asleep,

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.180
I might sell you off?

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.790
The money in that bag is all yours.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.000
There will be even more in the future.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:20.010
As long as you help me this time,

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.210
I'll change the rest of your life,

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:26.350
let you live the life
you've always wanted,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:28.540
just like back in Haizhou.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.960
You'll be caught by the police
sooner or later.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:42.760
I'm not stupid.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.790
I won't die together with you.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.340
If someone keeps dealing drugs,

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:54.720
there's no way they can stay free forever.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.700
If you want wealth from danger,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.300
two conditions must be met:

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.960
First—

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.310
increase the efficiency of making money.

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:02.810
You must, in the shortest time,

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.470
earn the most money possible.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.030
Second—

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.880
once I've earned the amount
my heart truly desires,

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.069
I'll quit for good.

00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:11.240
This kind of risk is controllable.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:12.990
When the time comes,

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.200
we'll leave Nuanhai

00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:17.500
and live a rich, comfortable life.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.930
I know

00:17:21.569 --> 00:17:24.170
these past two years
haven't been easy for you.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:28.540
Haven't you always
wanted to leave Haizhou—

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:31.720
leave this small county?

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:37.720
But

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.210
there are many ways to leave.

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:44.360
The plan I designed for you—

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.330
do you like it?

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:17.630
Jiajia,

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.480
you can't stay up all night.

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:21.800
Get some rest.

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:23.830
I'm not sleepy.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:50.220
Come on, move forward.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:53.910
The ones behind, keep up.

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.040
All clear.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.130
Go.

00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.480
Temporary inspection.

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.460
Drive forward.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:08.580
Slow down.

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.880
Come over here.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.900
Keep moving forward.

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.660
Zhang Yan.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:13.070
Ken.

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.280
Where are you going this late?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.720
Do you know what time it is?

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.200
I…

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.090
I'm taking the kids
to stay at Tao's for a day.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.640
What happened?

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:21.680
Such a big operation?

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.550
We're on a mission—

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:23.550
been up all night.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:26.900
Know them?

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.490
Yes.

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.320
They're my neighbors.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.190
He used to be my mom's student.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:31.390
He's now an accountant
at the county electronics factory.

00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:33.030
We've known each other for years.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.830
Why set off in the middle of the night?

00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.480
I‘m taking the kids to a friend's place.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.270
Tao's family

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:38.590
live by the seaside, right?

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:40.990
I wanted to take the kids
to see the sunrise.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.780
Roll down the back window.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:50.350
What's your relationship
to these two kids?

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.200
My daughter.

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:52.620
My niece.

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.110
How old?

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.980
Nine.

00:19:55.610 --> 00:19:56.340
Fourteen.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:58.090
Let me see your ID.

00:19:58.420 --> 00:19:59.150
ID.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.960
I left in a hurry,

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.890
didn't bring it.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:03.750
Then driver's license.

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:04.090
Driver's license.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:04.860
A driver's license will do?

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:05.420
Right.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:15.980
Step out of the car.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.530
Open the trunk for a look.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:27.820
Alright, that's fine.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.410
Okay.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.400
Hello, officer.

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:41.310
Hello.

00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.820
What's your name?

00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:45.790
My name is Cheng Jiajia.

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:47.200
I was asking about your cousin.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.310
Why isn't she talking?

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.230
Xiaoyu is sick.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.830
What illness?

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:54.400
She has congenital intellectual issues,

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.860
her mind isn't very sharp.

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.440
Has she seen a doctor?

00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:59.100
Yes.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:00.640
She's been seeing doctors
since she was little.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.160
I took her to the hospital yesterday.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.060
Yang Xinyu did her examination.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:06.030
He's also my mom's student,

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.830
a doctor at the county hospital.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:09.240
Her parents are local?

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:09.790
Yeah.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:10.970
Call them.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.370
It's this late—they're asleep.

00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:16.170
Make the call.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:21.150
I'll call them.

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:39.040
You'll be a while, huh?

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:40.370
Maybe the whole night.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:46.310
Connected?

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.830
Yes.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:48.710
They must be asleep.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:49.470
No answer.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:50.540
Ken.

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.400
What's wrong?

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400
Stop the car!

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.830
Stop the car!

00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:55.160
Freeze—stop!

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.030
Stop!

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:01.340
Stop the car!

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:07.680
Hurry, hurry!

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:08.810
Don't move!

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:09.550
Hands on your head!

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.240
Hands on your head!

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:10.820
Get out of the car!

00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.620
Get out now!

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.740
Out of the car, quickly!

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:15.880
Hands on your head!

00:22:17.050 --> 00:22:17.590
Get out!

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.200
Where's Ding Lai?

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.600
Step out for inspection.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:23.920
Get out now!

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:25.440
Our people blocked someone in front.

00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:26.220
What's going on?

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:27.620
Someone's been stopped.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.760
Those behind, move up fast.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:29.440
Ken.

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:31.350
I'll call you back in a bit.

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:43.950
Come.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:45.120
Follow me.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.430
Jiajia, you stay seated.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.950
Dad, why did you abandon Xiaoyu?

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.400
Will Xiaoyu die?

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:42.830
I'm sick too.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.000
So one day

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.930
will you abandon me as well?

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.330
I didn't leave her because she's sick.

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:49.890
Then why?

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.440
She won't die.

00:24:55.670 --> 00:24:56.190
But…

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.510
This is complicated.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.070
Xiaoyu was wearing your clothes.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.220
Liu Yi.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.230
Who killed the police officer?

00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.230
Ding Lai.

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:47.440
He took a bullet

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.680
and pushed him down.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.960
Where was he shot?

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.040
In the arm.

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:55.650
He said he was hit.

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:57.120
I'm too exposed right now.

00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.160
I can't run far.

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.200
We split up.

00:26:59.220 --> 00:26:59.620
Okay.

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:00.980
You go get the car first.

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.780
I'll find a way out of Nuanfeng.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.440
Alright.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.060
The bag!

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.170
Give it to me.

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:15.190
Who was the one trading with you?

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:16.990
Ding Lai contacted him.

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:19.100
He said his name was

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.310
Ao…

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:21.510
Ming.

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.420
Be clearer.

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.400
Ao Ming!

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:31.380
Do you know Lv Deli?

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.600
No.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.840
The one you met at Black Forest.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:39.730
That was my first time seeing him.

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:40.890
I don't know his name.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.070
Anyway, it was arranged

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.470
that he would carry a green canvas bag,

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:46.080
and Ding Lai would wear

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.880
a black hat with a special mark.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.240
Who set the rules?

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.400
Ao Ming.

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.340
So is this Lv Deli actually Ao Ming?

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.960
No idea.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.750
What was the deal about?

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.830
Everything was decided by Ding Lai.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.110
You're asking me
about Ding Lai's business—

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:01.240
I really don't know!

00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.700
Trying to play tricks with me again?

00:28:05.050 --> 00:28:06.450
I've told you everything

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:08.420
I can say.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.550
What I don't know—

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:13.290
shoot me and it won't help.

00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:37.060
[One Month Later]

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:52.320
Dad.

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.540
Are you there yet?

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.120
Where?

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:55.400
Where was I supposed to go?

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:56.850
Didn't we agree
to meet Liu's nephew at noon

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.020
for lunch together?

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.540
I... I forgot.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.510
I've already started eating.

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:01.940
You should apologize to them.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:02.620
Just cancel it.

00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:03.860
Don't.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:06.240
Liu even called me about it.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.350
I already promised him.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.630
If you stand them up,

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.050
I'll lose face.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.310
Well, I...

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.700
Wenjing, you have to go.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:13.440
Madam Wenjing.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:14.720
Alright, fine, fine.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.000
Stop nagging. I'll go.

00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:16.680
Hurry up.

00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.350
Alright.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:22.680
Wenjing.

00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.520
Why didn't you go eat at the cafeteria?

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:25.650
I'm eating already.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.130
You're eating already?

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.390
I even brought you two buns.

00:29:28.390 --> 00:29:29.250
Hand them to me.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:31.160
Watching the surveillance footage?

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.030
Nothing at all.

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:33.880
By the way, Director Dai said

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.000
you should go to his office right now.

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:37.130
For what?

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:39.170
Go and you'll find out.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.630
Then don't touch my food.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.380
Eating so happily.

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.320
My wife made it. How could it
not make me happy?

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.450
You wanted to see me?

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:55.550
Well…

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:56.410
I heard

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.810
you're still reviewing
the Yuelai Hotel surveillance.

00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:01.830
I only do it in my spare time,

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.410
during my own rest hours.

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.880
Alright, alright.

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.810
I'm not planning to criticize you.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:08.820
I called you here this time

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.640
to let you know

00:30:11.270 --> 00:30:12.800
there's news from the city.

00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.200
After discussion at the meeting,

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.210
regarding Comrade Jin Longfeng's

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:18.770
sacrifice,

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:21.260
you bear no responsibility at all.

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:23.350
They were completely fair and just.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.370
That's how it should be.

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:25.830
Feel relieved now, right?

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:28.590
But about your transfer
to the city bureau—

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:30.890
it probably won't happen this year.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.570
Why?

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:34.220
Well…

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:36.510
Some comrades in the Narcotics Unit

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:38.370
have certain opinions about you.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.350
Who could have known?

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:43.430
How could anyone have known
they were in action there?

00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:45.800
Not pursuing
your responsibility in this matter

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:46.920
is already a blessing.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.550
Right?

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.850
You're still...

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.110
Let me tell you.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.640
Stay away from Ding Lai's case.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.450
Don't glare at me.

00:30:55.790 --> 00:30:56.920
It's been over a month.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.590
He's probably not
even in Nuanfeng anymore.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.110
Even the Municipal Narcotics Unit
has withdrawn.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.240
What are you fussing about?

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:01.750
What do you mean I...

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:02.860
Stop it.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.880
I say one sentence,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.880
and you've got eight waiting for me.

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.360
I'll be honest with you.

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:10.860
I don't want you
going to the city bureau either.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:12.400
Look,

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:13.480
in our bureau,

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:15.800
there aren't many people left

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:18.340
with ability, experience,
and the guts to fight.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:19.250
If you leave,

00:31:19.310 --> 00:31:20.790
won't I have to train someone new?

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:21.960
Don't laugh.

00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.650
You really...

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:24.270
You really know how to play me.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:25.240
Play you?

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.680
I'm not playing you.

00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.720
I know that with your temper,

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.050
I can't stop you anyway.

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:31.920
So just wait a bit more.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:33.640
One year.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.920
After this whole thing passes,

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.350
I'll personally go to the city bureau
leaders to plead for you.

00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:37.920
Your child is still young.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:38.960
What's the rush?

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.790
My dear Director Dai,

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.920
I can't wait a year.

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.790
A whole year.

00:31:41.790 --> 00:31:43.200
How can I not be anxious?

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.320
My kid needs to get to

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.510
the primary school affiliated
with No.3 Middle School of the City first.

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:47.450
Otherwise how will she
ever get into No.3 Middle School later?

00:31:47.450 --> 00:31:48.030
You can...

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:48.640
Listen to me.

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.440
In the end,

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.960
it's all because
I didn't clear up Ding Lai's case.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.310
How about this?

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:54.160
For Ding Lai's case,

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.030
I promise you,

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.590
I will absolutely not
take up my working hours.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.720
I still have something this afternoon.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.310
After lunch,

00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.960
take a nap.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.480
Nap for what?

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.480
Just have a midday rest.

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.480
I'm not done talking yet.

You're staring blankly.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:17.970
You didn't sleep well last night?

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.640
It's been over 2 years
bringing Jiajia for dialysis.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:26.270
Every time, the night before coming here,

00:32:26.270 --> 00:32:27.470
I still get insomnia.

00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:30.410
It's almost become a routine.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:37.680
Logically, I'm someone
who adapts pretty well,

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.560
but this is something
I can never get used to.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.720
I know

00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:49.960
only the hospital can save Jiajia,

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.700
but I just hate this place.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.730
I hate it so much.

No mood to write.

there was something like...

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:40.580

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.310
I'd take it home, let Jiajia swallow it,

00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:51.370

Very busy.

About the blind date—my dad agreed to it.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.670
I personally had no intention of it.

00:34:17.670 --> 00:34:19.530
I needed to make that clear to you.

it's 3 to 10 years in prison.

Harboring an armed drug dealer—

00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:37.240

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:03.890
Over 400,000?

When my business was good,

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:08.140
I could make that back in 2 months.

you need to help me buy one more thing.

Are you out of your mind?

00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.030
Sounds like you're just full
and craving something sweet.

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.480
I've got a friend in Nuanfeng
called Daquan.

00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.840
He used to run with me.

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:59.680
Now he opened a milk tea shop
to distribute goods.

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.400
Nuanfeng is his territory.

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:04.530
I've thought it through.

With a narcotics officer dead,

going back to Haizhou to make money again

00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.590
is impossible now.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.650
The best option is
to bring Daquan under our wing,

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.960
use his sales network to make quick cash.

00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.720
He used to follow you.

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.020
Will he still listen now?

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:24.530
If he listens,

00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.820
I'll use the chicken to hatch the egg.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:28.730
If he doesn't,

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:32.660
I'll kill the chicken and take the eggs.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:47.060
Why are you here?

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.750
I came to see you.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:50.490
I don't want to see you.

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:52.090
We're already divorced.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:56.340
Even divorced people
can be friends, right?

00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:58.600

Have the creditors come
looking for you recently?

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.880
If you need help, just say it.

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:15.960
I've told you already.

00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:17.690
It was just cash-flow trouble.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:19.310
It's all settled long ago.

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:21.400

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.090
You've got another man, don't you?

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.350
What's wrong with you?

You don't even know

How would I not know?

00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:40.960
Don't you just love money

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.000
and big-name brands?

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.840
Are you insane?

00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:43.440
All those Chanel,

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.360
LV and Hermès nonsense...

00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.190
Li Xiaoya!

00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.220
Get in the car.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:49.840
So shallow.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:53.290
I'm so pissed off.

00:42:59.130 --> 00:43:00.170
So pissed off.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.530
Come on, you two

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.070
are already broken up.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:07.590
Can you stop clinging like this?

00:43:07.590 --> 00:43:08.650
Right there on the street?

00:43:08.650 --> 00:43:10.600
If he keeps harassing you on his own,

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:11.830
call the police or tell me.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:12.690
I'll handle it.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.150
When it really matters,

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:15.360
I still gotta rely on my bestie.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.000
You, me, and Wang Ping —

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.320
it’s been almost a month
since the three of us

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.250
last met, right?

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.840
I've been crazy busy lately.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:20.690
I really have.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:21.580
Busy with what?

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.700
Still that same case from before?

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:25.530
Did you catch the drug dealer?

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.160
How could I tell you that?

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:28.180
Alright.

00:43:28.220 --> 00:43:28.700
I get it.

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:29.460
Discipline.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.630
I won't ask.

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:32.110
What are you busy with?

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.710
Me?

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.960
I'm preparing to immigrate.

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.630
Again? Immigration again?

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:40.800
This time it's really solid.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.860
But once you leave,

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.590
we basically won't see each other anymore.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:45.150
I can video call you every day.

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:46.480
I can report everything to you.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.740
Do I look that free?

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:48.670
Fine then.

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:50.030
I'll video call Wang Ping instead—

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:51.070
won't include you.

00:43:51.070 --> 00:43:51.980
Why are we splitting...

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:52.940
Forming cliques?

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:54.940
Three people split into two groups?

00:43:57.780 --> 00:43:58.450
You're

00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:00.230
telling me about this.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.030
Are you

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.720
trying to give me a heads-up emotionally?

00:44:04.810 --> 00:44:07.340
Afraid I won't be able
to take it or something?

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.320
Your intuition

00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:13.670
is so sharp

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:15.180
that it even scares me.

00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:16.070
Why are you scared of me?

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.270
Only the bad guys should be scared of me.

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:31.770
