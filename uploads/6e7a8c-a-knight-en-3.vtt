WEBVTT

00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:58.349
Easy, boy.

00:01:27.378 --> 00:01:28.837
Come on!

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:29.923
Just run!

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:31.966
Move.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.843
You're stubborn as old iron.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.470
He's twice the size of your last rider,

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.347
and the field could be
just like this or worse,

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:40.058
so you best get your feet under you.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:45.395
My father told me
you should never talk to a horse.

00:01:45.396 --> 00:01:48.566
He said they're dumber than dogs
and only understand the crop.

00:01:54.364 --> 00:01:55.532
But I don't think that's true.

00:01:56.533 --> 00:01:59.743
I think a horse doesn't
want to be ordered about

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:01.412
any more than a man does.

00:02:04.374 --> 00:02:05.959
Ser Duncan only has us.

00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:08.878
And if he loses, he won't even have that.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.090
I can get the weapon in his hand...

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.551
somehow.

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:17.137
But then, it's up to you.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:26.604
Hyah! Go!

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.994
Hyah! Yah!

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.081
Hyah! Yah!

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.461
Not bad.

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.047
Ha! Go!

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:55.884
Go, Thunder!

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.224
Ser Duncan, take it.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.894
Ha! Go, Thunder!

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:13.942
Take it quick, Ser Duncan.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:15.944
Go, Thunder!

00:03:15.945 --> 00:03:18.030
Whoo!

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.282
Come on!

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:24.037
Whoo!

00:03:24.704 --> 00:03:27.623
Good boy. Good boy, Thunder.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.666
Good boy.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:31.377
You steal that horse?

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.601
Tell the truth. We'll be fair.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:50.480
It's not stealing
if you mean to put it back.

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:08.121
What's wrong with your hair?

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.083
What's wrong with your eye?

00:04:17.257 --> 00:04:18.299
Ahh!

00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.849
You're Ser Robyn Rhysling.

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.768
You're the maddest knight
in the Seven Kingdoms.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.271
We are a vessel for the Warrior.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.858
When it is madness bid,
it is madness delivered.

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:39.361
You're small for a squire.

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:41.447
I serve Ser Duncan the Tall.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.284
He's large enough for the both of us.

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.413
- We've not heard of him.
- You will.

00:05:05.179 --> 00:05:06.972
Where have you been?

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.224
Training.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.978
Don't wander off without telling me.

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:19.109
What are you doing, Ser?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.988
- Sewing a patch.
- Is that not my job?

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:24.282
You know how?

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.369
Then quit jawing and get the brushes.

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.247
Thunder looks like he's been
dragged through a hedge.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:33.582
What about breakfast?

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.460
There's salt beef after you're done.

00:05:36.627 --> 00:05:38.128
I'd sooner eat the horse, ser.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.548
You'll eat my fist
if you don't do as you're told.

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:51.642
Never mind that.

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:55.062
Yeah. Yeah, just like that.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.732
Keep it as close to the edge as possible.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:05:59.567
And that's your whipstitch.

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:01.986
How'd you get it so even?

00:06:03.613 --> 00:06:07.158
Just, like-- just practice.
Just try again.

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:12.705
- There.
- Yes!

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:17.501
- Ser?
- Mm-hmm?

00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:20.087
Is it odd that I have black hair
growing out of my stones?

00:06:20.088 --> 00:06:21.798
It's odd that you're telling me.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:27.594
Prince Baelor was the first born

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:30.055
Prince Maekar sprang out last

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.891
Daemon was the bastard,
so they kicked his bastard

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:36.561
Grass is green in summer,
green grass I adore

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:39.940
But grass is red all over
when you kill a rebel

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.691
Horses die in battle

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.693
This battle was the front

00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:47.114
Blackfyre's not a trueborn,
he came from the wrong

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:50.742
Country was in peril,
The Anvil was a rock

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:53.954
The Hammer smashed the bastard
with his giant veiny

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:57.750
- Host of Dornish spearmen
- It's time.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:01.421
- Fetch my armor.
- Now?

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.757
Aye, now.

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:06.759
Why?

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:10.679
Because I mean to enter the lists.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.348
You don't have your shield.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.019
We'll-- yeah, we'll gather it
along the way.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.187
Mm-hmm.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:22.607
Also, the right of the first challenge
goes to knights of high birth and renown.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.694
Are you a knight
of high birth and renown, ser?

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:29.781
Wait, so I cannot enter the lists today?

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:34.078
Not today, ser, no.
Only knights of high birth and renown.

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:38.707
Then why have I been vomiting all morning?

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.001
It's a mystery.

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.217
No, no, no, no, no.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:51.178
Goose eggs.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.180
Just the eggs.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.182
No, no, no.

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:58.895
Shit, goose eggs, like...

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.147
Just the...

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:04.150
Thank you.

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.571
Do you like goose eggs?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.450
Your shield will be ready
this evening, ser.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:15.912
Thank you.

00:08:27.548 --> 00:08:30.760
- Ooh, ooh! Ooh!
- Shut up.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:58.996
Mm!

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.501
Mm!

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.382
Come on!

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.719
- Come on! Whoo!
- Whoo!

00:09:15.596 --> 00:09:17.139
- Why not?
- Come on!

00:09:29.068 --> 00:09:30.736
Come on!

00:09:31.862 --> 00:09:33.114
Whoo!

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.369
Do you want some hard salt beef?

00:09:41.497 --> 00:09:44.332
Oh, I'm Egg. I can't eat hard salt beef.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:47.795
I just eat lovely food
and grapes and all the...

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.880
Can't even drink a pint of ale.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.508
Yeah, 'cause it's disgusting.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:55.760
- It's not disgusting.
- Yes, it is disgusting.

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:57.262
- It's not disgusting.
- It's disgusting.

00:09:57.263 --> 00:09:58.555
Well, then I won't buy you another one.

00:09:58.556 --> 00:09:59.557
Good.

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.188
I think I could be quite happy
in a place like this.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:10.275
You're in a place like this.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.193
I meant for a while.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:13.446
Ah, yeah.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:17.490
After I lead a great
campaign for my lord, of course.

00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:18.701
Of course.

00:10:20.036 --> 00:10:24.581
I return a war hero and he gives me
a parcel of land for my very own,

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.917
and the hand of his second
most beautiful daughter.

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:29.337
Second most?

00:10:30.379 --> 00:10:33.423
Well, you've already
married the first most.

00:10:33.424 --> 00:10:35.092
Have you not, ser?

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:41.473
I'd keep horses, plant oats and peas.

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:44.225
- Raise cows.
- And lambs, perhaps.

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:45.977
Fuck your lambs.

00:10:45.978 --> 00:10:50.148
Did you really ride all the way here
in the back of some farmer's wagon?

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:51.901
I don't want to talk about it.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.577
I'll say this for you.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:05.038
You're a good worker
when you put your mind to it.

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:06.540
Think so?

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.043
Mm-hmm.

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:15.924
Does that mean
I can stay on as your squire

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:17.718
after the tournament?

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.392
If I lose my first joust,

00:11:25.393 --> 00:11:27.812
I'll scarcely be a knight
after the tournament.

00:11:31.982 --> 00:11:33.442
But if you win?

00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:42.493
If I win...

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.041
If I win, you can--

00:11:50.042 --> 00:11:51.918
Ser Duncan?

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.713
A word, if you please.

00:12:01.512 --> 00:12:03.346
Is there an issue with my entry?

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:05.808
Hm? Oh, no. No, I...

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.019
I only wanted to show you
a new fishing spot I'm keen on.

00:12:13.649 --> 00:12:18.403
Ser Duncan,
I believe we are both men of honor.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:23.159
So, I hope you understand that what I ask
serves no private interest.

00:12:24.368 --> 00:12:26.494
Might it surprise you
to learn that my Lord Ashford

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:28.831
has richly overspent
on his daughter's pageant?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.292
- It might not.
- Mm.

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:36.963
Well, with winter not so long past,
and many of our flocks collapsed,

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:38.757
hard times lay ahead.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:42.511
Unless we endeavor
to reverse our fortunes.

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:48.601
I don't have any money, I...

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.606
Shocking, that may be,

00:12:54.815 --> 00:12:57.777
I mean not to rob you, but to reward you.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.614
- Reward me?
- Aye.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:06.368
What do you know of
Lord Ashford's youngest, Sir Androw?

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.087
He's a deft lance.

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:19.339
Indeed, indeed.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:24.177
But were a challenger to come forth

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.971
and unhorse Ser Androw, against all odds,

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.766
the lucky few who backed
such an unlikely winner

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:32.061
would find their pockets full.

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:40.736
Now, now, rest assured.
Rest assured, I mean no disrespect.

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:44.364
I ask only what you already intend.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:47.409
Drive your foe from his saddle
and take your place on champion's row.

00:13:49.328 --> 00:13:53.207
I do not want a victory
that I have not earned.

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:56.210
Have you not earned it?

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:02.006
Let Ser Androw take the fall,

00:14:02.007 --> 00:14:05.052
and you shall have his horse, arms,
and armor as recompense for your role.

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:09.640
A tidy sum for a young hedge knight
who presently calls an alder tree home.

00:14:11.559 --> 00:14:12.768
It's an elm.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:16.272
Elm.

00:14:20.442 --> 00:14:22.277
I beg you, think on it.

00:14:22.278 --> 00:14:24.238
I shall seek your answer on the morrow.

00:14:26.782 --> 00:14:29.368
Perhaps the rains will hold till then.

00:14:30.911 --> 00:14:32.580
Mind your pride, Ser Duncan.

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:05.528
Son of Meakar,
grandson to King Daeron the Good

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:08.531
and Prince of House Targaryen,

00:15:08.532 --> 00:15:11.869
Prince Aerion Brightflame.

00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:27.760
Hyah!

00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:44.360
Cousin.

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:54.787
Not to worry. I won't embarrass you today.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.168
Come out, come out, little knight.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.630
It's time you faced the dragon.

00:16:07.591 --> 00:16:08.842
Hyah!

00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:46.880
Hyah!

00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:50.009
Kill him. Kill him!

00:16:52.594 --> 00:16:54.555
Aww!

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:05.315
Lance!

00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:07.609
Go!

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.991
He's too low.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:24.269
- I want to leave.
- Aye.

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.612
That was a terrible sight.

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:36.989
But a squire must be strong.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.869
A mishap may befall me, and I'll need you
to keep your wits if it does.

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:43.831
That was no mishap.

00:18:50.254 --> 00:18:52.339
The jousting is done for the day, I think.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:54.675
Come, lad.

00:18:56.802 --> 00:19:00.513
Oh! Alice was a special lass

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:02.765
Born bereft 'er thumb

00:19:02.766 --> 00:19:06.519
Lost a digit tending flock,
now feeling awfully glum

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.021
Oh! Alice with three fingers

00:19:09.022 --> 00:19:10.898
A copper in her glass

00:19:10.899 --> 00:19:12.733
Had two fingers less than most

00:19:12.734 --> 00:19:15.153
She'll shove them up your arse, hey!

00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.614
I once gave her a silver,
feeling down and lone

00:19:18.615 --> 00:19:22.160
I tried to buy a pinky,
but I got the whole arm bone

00:19:22.161 --> 00:19:26.038
Oh! Alice with three fingers
never had a lot

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:27.999
She gave me all she had to give

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.500
Two more than what was sought

00:19:29.501 --> 00:19:31.336
Oh! Two more than what I bought

00:19:37.926 --> 00:19:39.678
Do you suppose there was an Alice, ser?

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:44.765
A crippled girl who shoved
her hand up men's arses?

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:46.351
I think there probably was.

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:48.896
Of course, there probably was.

00:19:50.105 --> 00:19:51.982
Do you think her name was really Alice?

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:58.697
Mm, no. I just think Alice
is a nice name to write a song to.

00:19:59.865 --> 00:20:01.407
That means there was a cripple girl

00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:03.743
who was so good at pleasuring men
in their bums

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:06.287
that they saw fit
to celebrate her in song,

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.623
yet they could not bother
credit her true name?

00:20:08.624 --> 00:20:13.002
If there's a lesson in that,
it's for wiser men than me to say.

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.713
Perhaps it is a story of honor.

00:20:15.964 --> 00:20:16.965
Honor?

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:20.886
A misfortuned girl making
the best of her natural gifts.

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:24.555
One might wish for more.

00:20:24.556 --> 00:20:26.724
But is this not the act
of a dogged spirit?

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:28.517
Giving more than what is asked?

00:20:28.518 --> 00:20:30.187
"The whole arm bone," as it were.

00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:33.731
Perhaps her name does not matter, then.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.567
It's her story that abides.

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:38.028
Her name is Hope, ser.

00:20:38.862 --> 00:20:40.530
Belongs to all who invoke it.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:45.785
Oh! Alice was a special lass

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:47.828
Born bereft 'er thumb

00:20:47.829 --> 00:20:49.664
She lost a digit tending flock

00:20:49.665 --> 00:20:51.208
And now she's awfully--

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.630
Did you ever know your father, Egg?

00:20:57.631 --> 00:20:59.049
Mm...

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:02.426
No. Not really.

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.388
Most like I saw mine hanged.

00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:09.642
There was a pot shop in Flea Bottom.

00:21:09.643 --> 00:21:12.646
I used to sell them rats and cats
and pigeons for brown.

00:21:13.647 --> 00:21:15.941
Cook there always said
my father was some thief.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:21.154
If he was as big as me,
he wouldn't have made a very good one.

00:21:33.583 --> 00:21:35.209
Say your fortune.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.336
Oh, yeah. Go on, then.

00:21:37.337 --> 00:21:40.173
You shall know great success
and be richer than a Lannister.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.926
Thank you. Do the boy now.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:48.015
You shall be king...

00:21:49.474 --> 00:21:53.395
and die in a hot fire,
and worms shall feed upon your ashes.

00:21:54.771 --> 00:21:57.524
And all who know you
shall rejoice in your dying.

00:21:58.483 --> 00:21:59.484
What?

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:04.197
Thank you, that's very good.

00:22:07.367 --> 00:22:09.076
Why would she say that?

00:22:09.077 --> 00:22:11.204
Why would she say what? Come on.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:16.752
Ser Duncan!

00:22:18.045 --> 00:22:19.587
I saw you earlier with this boy.

00:22:19.588 --> 00:22:22.631
Yeah. This boy is my squire.

00:22:22.632 --> 00:22:25.509
Egg, this is Raymun Fossoway.

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:26.762
Good day.

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.638
See our show! It's great!

00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:31.849
Will you join me in my tent
for a cup of cider?

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:34.310
I could wait at the puppet show, ser,

00:22:34.311 --> 00:22:36.480
and bring your shield
when the performance is over.

00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:41.109
We make it ourselves.

00:22:43.779 --> 00:22:44.863
Very well.

00:22:51.203 --> 00:22:53.245
Have you chosen an opponent yet?

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:55.040
Oh, I'm not sure.

00:22:58.335 --> 00:23:00.337
Who does your cousin mean to challenge?

00:23:01.505 --> 00:23:02.964
If anyone's wounded on the morrow...

00:23:04.007 --> 00:23:06.009
I'm sure Steffon will be quick
to knock on his shield.

00:23:07.469 --> 00:23:09.638
He's about as chivalrous
as a starved weasel.

00:23:17.354 --> 00:23:20.731
I suppose Ser Androw and I
are quite equally matched.

00:23:20.732 --> 00:23:23.527
A local favorite.
You mean to play the villain?

00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:27.613
I heard Aerion were in
a spittin' rage at Lord Ashford

00:23:27.614 --> 00:23:29.073
for giving away his horse.

00:23:29.074 --> 00:23:31.283
Little comfort that will be
to Ser Humfrey.

00:23:31.284 --> 00:23:32.952
It looked as if he was
going to carry the day.

00:23:32.953 --> 00:23:34.620
Now his leg's shattered
like a baking dish.

00:23:34.621 --> 00:23:37.999
My squire thinks Aerion meant
to kill the horse.

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:44.047
Just hard to accept that a knight
might be so dishonorable...

00:23:45.132 --> 00:23:46.382
let alone a prince.

00:23:46.383 --> 00:23:47.801
Why is that hard?

00:23:49.928 --> 00:23:51.011
No, I--

00:23:51.012 --> 00:23:52.764
They're incestuous aliens, Duncan.

00:23:54.391 --> 00:23:57.351
Blood-magickers and tyrants
who've burned our lands,

00:23:57.352 --> 00:23:59.270
enslaved our people,

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.313
dragged us into their wars
without a mote of respect

00:24:01.314 --> 00:24:02.982
for our history or our customs.

00:24:02.983 --> 00:24:04.608
Every pale-haired brat they saddled on us

00:24:04.609 --> 00:24:07.278
has been madder than the last,
gods know how.

00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:10.030
The only honorable thing a Targaryen

00:24:10.031 --> 00:24:12.908
can do for this realm
is finish on his wife's tits.

00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:15.328
So aye, I think he meant
to kill the fucking horse.

00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:26.006
I got a bit carried away there.

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:32.679
I heard that part
about the tits from Steffon.

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:44.858
Excuse me.

00:25:00.123 --> 00:25:01.666
Wow.

00:25:38.453 --> 00:25:42.331
Aerion, he's all smiles and chivalry
as long as his father's watching.

00:25:42.332 --> 00:25:44.500
I saw Prince Maekar's chair was empty.

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:47.503
He left Ashford this morning
to search for the rest of his misbegats.

00:25:47.504 --> 00:25:49.880
Misbegats? Which are those?

00:25:49.881 --> 00:25:53.008
His heir, Daeron, and the youngest.

00:25:53.009 --> 00:25:55.094
They departed Summerhall
together a few days ago,

00:25:55.095 --> 00:25:56.846
but never reached Ashford.

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:00.307
There's rumors going about
that the boys are dead.

00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:02.726
Though most like Daeron,

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:04.104
he's probably just drunk again.

00:26:06.773 --> 00:26:10.276
Little wonder Maekar's been walking around
like someone pissed in his swan pie.

00:26:10.277 --> 00:26:12.444
He's probably just worried about his sons.

00:26:12.445 --> 00:26:14.363
Seven know why.

00:26:14.364 --> 00:26:17.993
Daeron's a sot.
Aerion's just vain and cruel.

00:26:18.994 --> 00:26:20.786
The third's so useless,
they were gonna ship him off

00:26:20.787 --> 00:26:22.621
to a citadel to make a maester of him.

00:26:22.622 --> 00:26:25.249
- And the youngest--
- Ser! Ser Duncan! You have to come!

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.460
- Aerion's hurting her.
- Hurting who?

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:32.924
Stay back!

00:26:53.445 --> 00:26:54.403
Hold still!

00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:55.488
Hold on!

00:27:16.926 --> 00:27:19.387
Why did you throw your life
away for this whore?

00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:22.766
She's scarcely worth it.

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.227
She's a traitor.

00:27:28.271 --> 00:27:29.731
The dragon ought never lose.

00:27:34.736 --> 00:27:35.904
Nothing more to say?

00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:45.872
You've loosened one of my teeth.

00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:51.294
So, we'll start by breaking out
all of yours.

00:28:03.473 --> 00:28:06.058
No! Don't touch him!

00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.352
- Ah...
- You stupid boy!

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:10.229
Hold your tongue or they'll hurt you.

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:11.772
- No, they won't.
- Watch out, please.

00:28:11.773 --> 00:28:13.524
- Excuse me.
- If they do, they'll answer to my father.

00:28:13.525 --> 00:28:14.942
Let go of him!

00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:16.986
Wate, Yorkel, do as I say.

00:28:19.948 --> 00:28:23.409
You impudent little rat.
What's happened to your hair?

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:26.663
I cut it off, brother.
I didn't want to look like you.
