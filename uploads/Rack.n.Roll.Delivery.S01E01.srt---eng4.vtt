WEBVTT

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:26.680
Old Ghost

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.040
You have no martial ethics.

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:29.200
Congratulations

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.400
The final move of the Six Marvelous Strokes

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.239
You have mastered it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.599
The ten years are up

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.640
You have graduated

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.640
Master

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.280
The decennial Super Power Cup

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.560
is coming soon

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.000
I know you have waited a long time for this moment

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.319
The world is vast

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.319
with countless capable people

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.120
You possess unique skills

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.760
but you must never use them for ill-gotten gains

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.359
The shock from ten years ago

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.280
caused you psychological trauma

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.560
but it was a blessing in disguise

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.439
You gained super hearing

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.719
I hope it can help you

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.360
eliminate unnecessary distractions

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:11.680
Thank you, Master

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:14.479
You must walk the path ahead on your own

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.000
Remember

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:17.680
Walk the right path

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.080
Do the right thing

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.080
I will take it to heart

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.039
Have you decided on a name?

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.439
Hei Ba

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.039
Very good

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.479
Only a resolute heart

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:33.240
can shatter the enigma

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.120
If I were twenty years younger

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:38.639
I would definitely

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.879
play a good game with you

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.639
What a pity

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.879
A pity

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.800
Don't worry, Master

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.800
I will take back everything that belongs to me

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.319
So you are

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.120
the legendary 9-Ball Queen

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.039
Have some manners

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:04.400
Cover yourself up

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.000
Careful not to expose yourself

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:08.759
If you lose

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.879
your title of 9-Ball Queen

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.159
will belong to me

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.120
Thanks for the Big Rockets, brothers

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.759
Ke'er loves you forever

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.000
So amazing

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:57.319
Awesome

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.319
Number ending in 7086

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:07.879
Who has the number ending in 7086?

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.919
What are you filming?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.319
Number ending in 7086

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.560
Don't you know to lower the camera?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.560
7086

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.599
The coffee you ordered is here

00:04:21.879 --> 00:04:23.040
Are you blind?

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.279
Can't you see we're live streaming?

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.560
Get lost

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:36.160
Lang Jiu

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.240
Do you not have eyes?

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.639
You stinking delivery guy

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:51.160
I won

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.319
You ruined a good shot of mine

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:06.399
What do you say we do?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.519
Meddlesome trash

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.680
It's been ten years

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.879
Still so rude

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:30.800
Get... get him

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.680
Don't fight! Don't!

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.519
What are you doing?

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:50.759
Let go of me

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.680
Just watch the show

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:53.600
Let go of me

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.560
Weiwei

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.720
Are you calling me?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.399
Who dares to smash this place?

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.399
Boss Lady

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.079
Your billiard club is quite something

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.360
People who don't know

00:06:42.519 --> 00:06:43.959
would think it's a triad den

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:46.600
No wonder it gets reported so often

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.240
Lang Jiu

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:49.720
What are you good for?

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.759
B-B-B-Boss Lady

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:52.959
My fault

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:54.639
It's not what you and Boss Nan think

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:55.639
Please spare me

00:06:56.079 --> 00:06:57.519
You know what to do

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.600
Clean up your own mess

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:06.160
Get out of here, now

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:08.560
Let's go

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.000
This place

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.680
should have closed down long ago

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:47.279
Is that you?

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.480
Long Weiwei?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.639
Weiwei.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:50.240
Congratulations on winning the championship.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:50.839
I did it.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:52.720
I can marry you now.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.160
Weiwei.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.000
From now on, you'll be the champion's wife.

00:07:55.199 --> 00:07:56.600
Who said I wanted to marry you?

00:08:05.439 --> 00:08:06.079
What are you doing?

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:07.120
Do you know who this is?

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:07.879
Do you have a death wish?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.079
Weiwei!

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.560
Don't you recognize me?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.879
It is reported that

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:20.879
early this morning,

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:23.000
a gas explosion in a residential area in the western suburbs

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.920
caused an accidental fire,

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.240
resulting in the death of a woman.

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.680
No remains were found.

00:08:41.399 --> 00:08:44.200
Weiwei!

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:52.960
Look closely.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:54.759
Who is standing in front of you?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.919
Tell him who I am.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.120
Kid.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.200
Look closely.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.960
This is Yi Xin, the Boss Lady of our Liheng Group.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.600
Look at yourself, you're trash.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:14.559
How dare you mess with the Boss Lady?

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.159
A toad lusting after swan meat.

00:09:17.039 --> 00:09:17.559
Impossible.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:18.639
I couldn't be mistaken.

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:20.000
You are Long Weiwei.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:27.679
Instead of letting your imagination run wild,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:30.200
you should go get your head checked.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.559
Impossible.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.120
I can't be wrong.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.440
You are Long Weiwei.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.600
Your delivery is here.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.519
Leaving already?

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.000
I...

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.600
I ordered so much takeout just to find you.

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:26.840
I won't let you

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.000
like yesterday

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.960
get away so easily today.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.200
What do you want?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.519
What do I want?

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.200
Because of you,

00:10:33.519 --> 00:10:35.039
my account got banned.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.799
Do you have any idea how much my account

00:10:36.799 --> 00:10:37.679
is worth?

00:10:38.519 --> 00:10:39.120
I don't know.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:40.440
And I don't want to know.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:41.480
You leave.

00:10:42.279 --> 00:10:43.759
If you leave, I'll give you a bad review.

00:10:47.159 --> 00:10:48.200
What's your name?

00:10:49.679 --> 00:10:50.399
Hei Ba.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.759
Oh.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:01.840
Here.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.159
This is my phone number.

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.879
I'll contact you anytime.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:13.519
What for?

00:11:13.759 --> 00:11:14.240
Yo.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:15.039
Mr. Big Streamer.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.279
Account got banned?

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:18.480
Perfect timing to join our Nine Heavens Media.

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.879
Let my team package you properly.

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:22.320
Package my ass.

00:11:23.639 --> 00:11:24.440
No, wait.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.519
I think you did this on purpose.

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.120
Causing trouble in my stream,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.159
getting my account banned.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.919
Just so you could swoop in.

00:11:31.559 --> 00:11:32.879
Sign with Nine Heavens?

00:11:33.399 --> 00:11:34.440
Don't even think about it.

00:11:41.759 --> 00:11:43.000
He got away again.

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:45.759
Stubborn mule.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.159
He really won't listen to reason.

00:12:13.679 --> 00:12:15.639
You talked such a big game back then,

00:12:15.879 --> 00:12:17.519
promising to sign her to the company.

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.639
But in the end,

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.279
she got away,

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.440
and the joint got raided.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.480
A bunch of our brothers, in broad daylight,

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.080
were all thrown in the slammer.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.559
Is your brain made of paste?

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.120
Getting played like a fiddle by a female streamer.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.120
Boss, Boss.

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:34.320
I was wrong.

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:36.320
I intended to use the nude photos

00:12:36.639 --> 00:12:37.840
to force her into Nine Heavens.

00:12:38.039 --> 00:12:39.000
I didn't expect

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.919
to get screwed over by a delivery guy.

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:41.799
Boss,

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:42.960
give me another chance.

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:43.600
I...

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.120
I'll teach that girl a lesson

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.480
and make it right for you.

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:49.840
Remember,

00:12:50.559 --> 00:12:51.639
don't hurt her face.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.120
Her face

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.320
is worth more than your life.

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:57.720
Understood.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:58.759
Understood.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:06.840
Nan... Boss Nan.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:08.720
I've got an unexpected bonus here.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.519
L-Look at this guy.

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:12.639
D-Does he look familiar?

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:16.080
Interesting.

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.320
The former Snooker King

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.080
turned into a delivery guy.

00:13:21.759 --> 00:13:23.159
And he's deaf, too.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:30.159
No wonder he vanished for ten years.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.039
Ten years have passed.

00:13:32.639 --> 00:13:33.639
This debt...

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:35.279
it's time to settle it.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600
Nan-Nan... Boss Nan.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.080
He's changed his name.

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.480
He goes by Hei Ba.

00:13:42.519 --> 00:13:44.039
That championship match back then

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:46.200
cost me two fingers.

00:13:49.919 --> 00:13:51.120
Find him for me.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.720
This time,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.399
it's time he paid the price.
