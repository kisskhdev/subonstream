00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.890
Uncle Lei,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.020
you must know about Yin Dai
stealing the credit.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.930
Why did you never tell me?

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.096
What good would it have done?

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.180
So many people saw it.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.130
Who ever spoke a word of justice?

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.660
But with my mother's temperament,

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.020
how could she endure it?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.490
Your mother was furious at first.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.980
But think about it.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.850
Your aunt was gravely injured

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.460
and didn't want to be disturbed.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.690
Moreover...

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.846
My mother had anticipated

00:02:06.857 --> 00:02:08.490
that the demonic sect
would seek revenge?

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.300
Though Nie Hengcheng was killed,

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.420
his disciples were vicious and powerful.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.980
Yin Dai took the credit,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.300
so he naturally had to bear
their retaliation.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.100
So,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.460
was Siqi Sect

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.180
massacred by the demonic sect

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.180
because of this?

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.380
Yes.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.140
Yang Yi died an untimely death

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.180
in that massacre.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.300
Only Yang Heying was left.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.060
The Yang clan then declined.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.053
All matters in this world

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.780
are but reaping what one has sown.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.860
Cause and effect cycle endlessly;

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.380
retribution never fails.

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.580
Master.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.300
Zhao.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.300
Xiuming.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.426
The medicine for you
has just been prepared.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:57.330
Zhao,

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:58.356
take it to your master.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.300
Alright.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.140
Thank you, Xiuming.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.060
Master.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.660
Yunke,

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.060
where do you plan

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.140
to bury Qiu?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.100
After all, we were fellow disciples.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.340
I think

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:21.780
we should put him

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.940
in the ancestral hall of Qingque Sect.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.840
The Yin family's ancestral hall?

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.100
Master,

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.460
Uncle Qiu would rather die
than turn back.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:33.780
Perhaps

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.653
he wouldn't wish
to enter the ancestral hall.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.060
Zhao is making a point.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.900
Then I'll find

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.060
another place for him.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.140
By the way, Zhao,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.860
that day,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.340
when you fought that villain,

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:50.660
did you see his appearance?

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.860
From head to toe,

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.400
he was tightly covered.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.620
But I felt

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:04.752
his bearing was extraordinary.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.940
Extraordinary bearing?

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.300
(Chuitian Dock)

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.140
This saliva

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.580
is so miraculous.

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.140
I'll go fetch some more for you.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.340
No need.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.810
Uncle Lei said the saliva
can warm the meridians,

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:23.300
but it can only help me recovery

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.340
to this point.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.540
Zhao.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.740
Why did Qian Xueshen

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.380
hand over the saliva once you left?

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:35.720
He must be touched

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.170
by my sincerity.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.140
And then

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.580
he died from poison?

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.210
The demonic sect

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.820
had long planted poison in him.

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.220
By the time I arrived,

00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:47.200
it was already too late.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.700
Alas.

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.220
Qian Xueshen is gone.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.300
Then,

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.380
what about Chang?

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:58.380
Did you meet him?

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.460
Did he help?

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.500
No.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:02.420
I didn't see him.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.940
No one helped me.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.260
Who knows where he went?

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.500
Zhao,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.940
you really didn't go
to the snow mountains?

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.100
Of course, I didn't.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.260
Those snow mountains are far away.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.140
How could I travel back and forth
in half a month?

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.100
Now that the crisis has passed,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.380
you should rest and recover.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.860
I asked my mother about the treasure

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:30.340
that can cure Nether Aura.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.773
She couldn't remember clearly

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.420
and said she needs to look again

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.373
through the notes and letters
left by my aunt.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.340
My mother

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.540
and my grandfather owe Luoying Valley.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:42.460
Yet you're still willing to help me.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.620
I'm deeply grateful.

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.940
If you truly feel sorry,

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.260
why not pick

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:53.260
a few treasures from Guangtian Sect

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.340
and give them to me?

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.980
You can have anything

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.580
that Guangtian Sect and I have.

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.860
Thank you in advance.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.100
This money

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.340
is enough for you to open several shops.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.293
Where did it come from?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.300
Zhao, you've struck it rich.

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:18.700
Yuzhi's payment to me.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.740
The saliva is expensive.

00:06:21.246 --> 00:06:22.649
Does that mean Yuzhi's cultivation

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.660
can recover with the saliva?

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.140
He's not fully recovered,

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.620
but he's been better.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.369
If he wants a complete cure,

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:30.780
he'll still need a healing treasure.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.620
Heaven truly envies talent.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.340
Uncle said Chang's poison
has also not been fully cured

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.130
and still needs an antidote.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.900
Take out the remaining saliva.

00:06:44.166 --> 00:06:45.853
- My wounds haven't healed.
- Take it out.

00:06:45.866 --> 00:06:47.333
- I can't win.
- Take out the saliva.

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.300
You soaked in the Wanzai Hot Spring

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.180
for quite some time.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.300
Your injuries have healed.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.380
Only one of his poisons
remains hard to remove.

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:54.520
So, he still needs rest.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.860
Zhao,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.980
that day at the Dusk Palace,

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.300
you accused Ning
of being a demonic sect spy.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.140
Was that true?

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.180
Of course not.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.546
That was just for show.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.260
Otherwise, how could we

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.596
draw them out

00:07:07.607 --> 00:07:08.847
and expose the Body Shift plot?

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:11.420
That's what I thought.

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.420
Chang's acting was so convincing.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.700
That reaction had me thinking
he truly fled in fear of guilt.

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.060
Then where is Ning now?

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.260
Who knows?

00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:24.380
Maybe he's hiding somewhere
enjoying himself.

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.380
Now that he's healed,

00:07:26.533 --> 00:07:28.179
he's probably making
a fortune somewhere.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.860
Anyway, he never wanted to stay here.

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.100
Didn't he swear
to avenge his father before?

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.740
People change.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.860
He might've made another decision.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.620

Young...

Mu Qingyan,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:20.740
you're still alive.

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:23.540
A mere injury from the Wudu Palm.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.060
What's so hard to cure?

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.140
Go back and tell Nie Zhe

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.240
that the Young Master is back

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.060
and will reclaim everything that belongs

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.180
to the Mu clan.

You've always been meticulous

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:41.700
and steady in your actions.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.500
How could this brilliant scheme
to topple Qingque Sect

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:47.660
have failed?

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:49.140
Originally,

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.100
everything was under my control.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:52.940
However, Cai Pingshu's niece

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.220
obtained the antidote to the Body Shift.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.980
Thus, the plan failed.

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.540
Cai Pingshu's niece?

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.580
How is her martial skill?

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.980
She bears much
of Cai Pingshu's former presence.

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.780
I never expected Cai Pingshu
to leave behind such a remnant

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.020
to continue wreaking havoc on our sect.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.100

Do you know

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.660
your son has returned?

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:49.420
Impossible.

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.940
He's back,

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.620
unaffected by your poison.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.620
Impossible.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.940
Chief, you must believe me.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:01.020
This poison has no cure.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.500
Mu...

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.100
He is

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:07.740
just struggling to live.

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.380
He'll die soon.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.460
Of course, I believe you.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.260
But isn't this too coincidental?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.180
He appeared

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.420
precisely when the strategist

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:23.820
screwed up the plan.

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:36.060
Where did Chang Ning of Chang Fort go?

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.180
Why is there not the slightest clue

00:11:38.307 --> 00:11:39.613
about the item we're looking for?

00:11:39.624 --> 00:11:41.220
After Chang Ning went down the mountain,

00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:42.333
he vanished without a trace.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.900
I've sent people to search everywhere.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.860
Make sure to find that item.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.060
Understood.

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.340
Time to think about how to deal
with Mu Qingyan.

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.740
Elder Hufa,

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.140
what do you think?

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.740
(Hu Fengge, Elder Hufa of Li Sect)

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:09.460
Rest assured, Chief.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.620
Once he comes,

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.220
he will surely die.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.060
With you and the strategist,

00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:17.580
I naturally feel at ease.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.100
Cai Pingshu's niece

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.740
has such courage.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:42.140
I was careless and got struck

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.060
by Qi Yunke's Huolong Palm.

00:12:47.227 --> 00:12:48.427
Had I known this would happen,

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.180
I should've gone with you.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:55.420
If you didn't stay in Bliss Palace,

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:57.380
how could I

00:12:58.660 --> 00:12:59.980
be at ease outside?

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.140
Mu Qingyan has returned

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.940
with better martial strength.

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.460
Maybe

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:12.460
he cultivated some miraculous method.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:14.740
Moreover,

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.180
Qinong's token has fallen

00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.220
into Cai Pingshu's niece's hands.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:20.620
I fear

00:13:20.940 --> 00:13:22.540
Qinong and Elder Tianji

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:25.900
are already dead.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.186
With troubles within and without,

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.580
in these turbulent times,

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.460
you and I

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.060
must not be careless.

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:46.615
(To Zhao, my daughter)
Yuzhi, my mother has replied.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.820
This treasure is called Jade Sunflower.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:51.020
It was stolen
from the demonic sect's treasury

00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:52.040
by my aunt's close friend.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.300
After curing
the Shi brothers' Nether Aura,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:55.973
its whereabouts became unknown.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:57.180
So,

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.100
there is still no clue.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.500
I suspect

00:14:00.859 --> 00:14:02.620
it returned
to the demonic sect's treasury.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:03.540
How do you know?

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:05.540
My aunt acted with integrity.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:06.553
She wouldn't keep

00:14:06.564 --> 00:14:08.020
a demonic sect treasure for herself.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.540
I think after using the Jade Sunflower,

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:12.220
she returned it intact.

00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:14.060
Ms. Cai truly was such a person.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.260
Why don't we go steal it

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.140
from the demonic sect treasury?

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:22.980
The demonic sect is in great turmoil.

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.020
It's not that simple.

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.260
What are you two doing?

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.500
What are you two doing?

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.980
We're discussing important matters.

00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:34.373
What important matter
requires discussing face-to-face?

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:35.900
- Lingbo, I...
- Quiet.

00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:36.780
I wasn't asking you.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:39.620
I can't tell you now.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:40.700
Even to me?

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.540
But you can tell her?

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:44.380
Lingbo, actually...

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.413
No need to explain to her.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:47.380
Qi Lingbo,

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.420
have you already forgotten

00:14:49.431 --> 00:14:50.660
what you said to me days ago?

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.700
Yuzhi,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.340
do you think I'm too stupid

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.980
and incompetent to help you?

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.460
Is that why you discuss
everything with her?

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.020
Or is it you...

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:05.953
You're overthinking it.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:07.340
I'm not.

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:10.060
I'm the one closest to you.

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:12.500
Yet now, you're not even willing

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.100
to talk to me.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.140
Well,

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.460
sorry to interrupt you two.

00:15:20.553 --> 00:15:21.540
I'll take my leave first.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.020
Cai Zhao, stop right there.

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:25.140
Cai Zhao, stop right there!

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.340
Cai Zhao!

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:30.820
Father.

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.700
Uncle.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.500
You're bleeding.

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.340
Son,

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.755
didn't you use to dislike

00:15:47.766 --> 00:15:49.500
these gold and silver vulgarities
the most?

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.980
Why have people deliver these this time?

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.460
Zhao likes them.

00:15:53.739 --> 00:15:54.820
Compared to refined objects,

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.580
she seems to prefer gold and silver.

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.500
These are for Zhao?

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.420
You like her.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:08.340
I'm giving her these

00:16:08.705 --> 00:16:10.426
to thank her for helping me
find medicine.

00:16:11.126 --> 00:16:12.380
I'm still bound by a betrothal.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:14.233
Father, please don't say that.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:15.700
Don't harm Zhao's reputation.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.020
Son,

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:17.940
listen to me.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.740
A true confidant is hard to find.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.180
Fate is something you must seize.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:25.820
To be honest,

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.300
your betrothal to Lingbo

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.980
was decided on a whim
by your mother and Lady Yin.

00:16:29.991 --> 00:16:31.545
I've always felt it was inappropriate.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.500
Coincidentally,

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:34.660
Lady Yin invited me to discuss matters.

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:36.820
I can just help you annul the betrothal.

00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:37.940
Father,

00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.180
a betrothal is serious.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.780
Even if I have no feelings for Lingbo,

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.173
I must first report this to Master.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.860
Moreover,

00:16:46.086 --> 00:16:47.720
the sect's turmoil
has only just settled,

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:49.740
and Senior Qiu just died.

00:16:50.486 --> 00:16:51.860
If we break off the betrothal now,

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.813
everyone will think Lingbo despises me

00:16:53.824 --> 00:16:55.010
for being injured and useless.

00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.540
How would Lingbo
face herself in the future?

00:16:58.900 --> 00:16:59.740
Son,

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.940
you always hesitate like this.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.140
What if Zhao leaves you?

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.460
I still need to cultivate.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:08.100
Goodbye.

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:09.140
You...

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.860
Look, the fish have grown quite a bit.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:20.820
Feed them some more.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:23.340
Look at that one.

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.980
I heard Yuzhi sent
a lot of valuables to Zhao.

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.300
Shijun, do you know about it?

00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:31.020
The saliva Zhao sent over

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:32.580
is truly good stuff.

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:33.900
Yuzhi used it in his medicine,

00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:35.940
and the cold energy
in his body decreased a lot.

00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:36.860
With such great merit,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:38.700
even sending more treasures

00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:39.900
would be only proper.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:44.300
Zhao did a great service this time.

00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:47.460
Back then,

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:48.980
Pingshu's grace and bearing

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.500
were already breathtaking.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:53.660
What a surprise that her niece
would be just as outstanding.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.140
So young,

00:17:55.293 --> 00:17:56.593
yet calm in the face of trouble,

00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:57.700
brave and resourceful,

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.166
worthy of great responsibility.

00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.140
The Cais did a great job in parenting.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.900
Yuzhi also showed
the air of a great general.

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.460
If not for his steady response,

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.020
there might've been complications.

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.980
Shijun, have some tea.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.260
Yuzhi naturally carries
my old style and spirit.

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.780
I only hate the Nether Aura.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.580
Once I leave,

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.380
even if I wear out iron shoes

00:18:30.499 --> 00:18:31.533
and spend all my wealth,

00:18:31.544 --> 00:18:33.433
I'll try my best to find
more medicine for him.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:34.980
Are you going to leave?

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:36.540
Yes.

00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.420
There are many matters in the sect,

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.140
all borne by Xiuzhi alone.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:41.540
I can't set my mind at ease.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:43.380
Since you're about to leave,

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:44.660
why not take these two days

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.900
to set Lingbo and Yuzhi's wedding date?

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:50.860
It will also make it easier for Lingbo
to take care of Yuzhi.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.340
Well.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.260
There's no rush.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.140
No rush.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.180
Let's wait until Yuzhi recovers.

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:01.180
What if his injury never heals?

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.020
Yuzhi is still young.

00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:06.300
One year, two years,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.700
at most three or five years.

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:08.940
He will recover eventually.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.300
As for the marriage,

00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:11.780
we can decide later.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:45.980
Let me see.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.620
Milady,

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:52.260
you don't need to do

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.820
such rough work.

00:19:55.380 --> 00:19:57.220
Just have the servants do it.

00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.460
No.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.620
This is something close to Yuzhi.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.460
How could I let others handle it?

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.200
It's getting cold.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.020
I need to finish it quickly for Yuzhi.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.780
No need to care so much about him.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.940
Yuzhi is my fiancé.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:17.660
If I don't care, who will?

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:19.860
But what if he doesn't have you
in his heart?

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.460
Yuzhi and I grew up together.

00:20:24.563 --> 00:20:26.032
How could he not have me in his heart?

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:28.060
It's just that he's been injured lately,

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.100
and his mood is low.

00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:31.260
He is a bit more distant than before.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.340
But in the end,

00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:34.700
we do have a betrothal.

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.820
The betrothal was decided by the elders.

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:38.140
It's not impossible to cancel.

00:20:39.860 --> 00:20:40.700
Mother,

00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:45.140
the betrothal was decided
by you and Aunt.

00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:47.500
Before Aunt passed away,
she repeatedly instructed

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:48.993
that this betrothal must be honored.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:50.406
How could we go back on our word?

00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.300
I made a mistake.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.220
Your aunt passed away so suddenly.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.620
That's why it was decided hastily.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.100
You know Yuzhi better than anyone.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.940
He only loves martial cultivation.

00:21:00.046 --> 00:21:01.020
His temperament is cold.

00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:02.620
He's not close to you.

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:04.460
So,

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.326
you told me to restrain my temperament

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.740
and get closer to Yuzhi.

00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.460
After Yuzhi was injured,

00:21:09.471 --> 00:21:10.802
I showed care and consideration,

00:21:10.813 --> 00:21:11.733
attentive in every way.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.380
I've done all of that.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:15.820
But however you please him,

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:18.180
has he ever been even gentler
toward you?

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.460
I can't bear to see you suffer anymore.

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:23.700
From now on,

00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:25.140
keep some distance from him.

00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:28.540
I'm fine.

00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:30.340
I don't think I'm suffering.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.300
Very soon,

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.820
Yuzhi's injury will heal,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.980
and everything will get better.

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:37.220
Stop deceiving yourself.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.700
The poison he suffered is Nether Aura.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.660
The chance of recovery is slim.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.820
He may never be the Lord.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:45.740
And you are the Lord's daughter.

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.820
If your husband
can't love you or protect you,

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.260
how will you secure
your position in the sect?

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:51.980
What do you mean?

00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:53.700
Do you want me to abandon

00:21:53.711 --> 00:21:55.311
my fiancé because of his incompetence

00:21:55.322 --> 00:21:56.740
and marry another man just like you?

00:21:56.740 --> 00:21:57.580
Nonsense.

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.700
Everything I do is for your own good.

00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:02.180
The Yins have operated
within the sect for generations.

00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.880
Are we to watch helplessly
as someone else

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.260
takes charge of the sect?

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.140
So what?

00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:07.660
What do you take me for?

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.700
A puppet to maintain the Yins' power?

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.980
Enough. How dare you accuse me?

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.260
When I was lazy in cultivation before,

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:24.340
you failed to urge me to improve

00:22:24.860 --> 00:22:27.020
and even told me stories
of powerful women

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:28.700
meeting tragic ends.

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.660
But now,

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.780
I truly envy Cai Zhao.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.060
When the sect faced a crisis,

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:36.220
she was brave and fearless,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:37.860
able to turn the tide.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.420
She can do what she wants to do.

00:22:40.513 --> 00:22:42.569
She doesn't need others
to love her or protect her.

00:22:42.580 --> 00:22:44.220
She can protect herself.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.740
Milady,

00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:49.180
Lady Yin is only worried about you.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.060
Is she worried about me,

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:53.020
or does she look down on me?

00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:55.460
You were just like Grandfather,

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.020
believing women cannot be lords,

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.180
insisting on finding
a powerful husband,

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.420
until you met Cai Pingshu.

00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:03.653
Then you finally realized

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:05.740
that women too can be powerful,

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:08.060
brave, and unstoppable.

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.900
So, you and Aunt harbored resentment,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.020
targeting the Cais at every turn,

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.540
even using Cai Pingshu's tragic death
to warn me,

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.189
wanting me to walk the same path

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.740
of attaching myself to others as you.

00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.082
What's so great about Cai Pingshu?

00:23:22.093 --> 00:23:23.426
She died young.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.100
If I could die as spectacularly
as Cai Pingshu,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.420
an early death would be worth it.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.020
Lingbo.

00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.620
What did I say wrong?

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:38.460
It was all Grandfather's selfishness

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:40.900
that caused so many tragedies
and disasters.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.580
For the Yin's power,

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.100
for the position of the Lord's wife,

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.140
how many more people must you sacrifice?

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.140
Lingbo...

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:52.100
Milady.

00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:53.820
Lingbo?

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.300
Milady.

00:23:57.260 --> 00:23:58.100
Lady Yin.

00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:03.420
Dalou, why are you here?

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.140
I heard you were struck
by the Chaos Needle.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:09.940
Why aren't you resting?

00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:11.540
Thank you for your concern.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.460
I'm already much better.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.580
Master ordered me to come

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:18.460
and return this to you.

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:32.860
The Clearing Pill.-

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:30.620
(Grave of Qiu Renjie)

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:48.140
Since you're here,

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.260
come pay your respects.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:56.820
Why did you have Dalou return the pill,

00:25:56.966 --> 00:25:58.106
yet you didn't come yourself?

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.140
Since that day,

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.180
you've been avoiding me.

00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:06.180
Are you bothered by my past with Qiu?

00:26:07.386 --> 00:26:09.100
When he pretended to be you,
we did not...

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:10.980
I know you did not cross any boundaries.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:12.780
Then why is it?

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.220
Qiu held deep resentment
toward my father.

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:16.820
He left the sect long ago.

00:26:16.859 --> 00:26:18.180
One-sided words cannot be trusted.

00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:19.020
Dear,

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.260
even if Qiu Renjie wronged everyone,

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:22.740
he'd never wrong you.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.660
If he truly intended to humiliate you,

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.900
he would not have repeatedly

00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.340
kept you outside his door.

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:31.060
If he truly were a spy,

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:32.260
even for appearances,

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:34.100
he would've pretended
to be close to you.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.620
But he refused to approach you at all,

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.060
just to protect your reputation.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.820
That was what let Yuzhi see the flaw.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.580
Not to mention

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.420
that Clearing Pill.

00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.380
Are you blaming me

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.180
for keeping the pill all these years?

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.700
Then what about you,

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:54.180
going to Luoying Valley every year,

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.380
thinking of a bedridden woman?

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.300
Forget it.

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:36.180
(Grave of Qiu Renjie)

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:46.420
(Qinglong Altar)

00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:57.340
(Lian Shisan, Li Sect)

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:14.620
(You Guanyue, Master of Qinglong Altar)

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:17.700
Today is Master You's birthday.

00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.740
There should surely be many guests,

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.220
lively and bustling.

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.380
Thank you all for coming...

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:28.820
Where is everyone?

00:28:30.213 --> 00:28:31.500
Why isn't there a single person?

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.133
This is bad, Master You.

00:28:34.813 --> 00:28:36.860
There are rumors
that you colluded with Mu Qingyan,

00:28:36.871 --> 00:28:38.542
just like your adoptive father,
Elder Qiu,

00:28:38.553 --> 00:28:39.329
intending to rebel.

00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:40.420
To avoid suspicion,

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:41.740
no one dares to come.

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:42.700
What?

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:44.900
Me?

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:47.140
Rebel?

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.300
Isn't this slandering me?

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:51.740
This is more unjust
than snow falling in midsummer.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:56.820
Shisan,

00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.180
bring paper and ink.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.660
Yes.

00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.620
This petition of grievance to the Chief

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:18.780
must show some sincerity.

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:28.100
Shisan,

00:29:28.853 --> 00:29:30.260
let me see your long, slender hand.

00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:35.980
What are you doing?

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:43.460
Dear Chief,

00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:45.820
since joining the Li Sect,

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.500
I've only known the Nie clan,
never the Mu clan.

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.260
My loyalty to you

00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:58.380
is wholehearted and true.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.420
It's Master You's birthday.

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.700
Why is it so desolate?

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.340
Mr. Yu, you're here.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.780
My Qinglong Altar is truly honored.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.100
I heard that you stirred

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.620
the Six Sects into discord

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:22.420
and left them with a mess with ghostly

00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:23.460
and unfathomable methods.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.300
What a remarkable deed.

00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:28.100
What have I done to deserve

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.260
your personal congratulations?

00:30:33.580 --> 00:30:34.420
I...

00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:36.060
I'm so moved that I could cry.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:37.980
Li Yi.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.380
The Chief heard it's your birthday

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:43.300
and had someone find

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.940
Elder Qiu's spear from the treasury

00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:47.460
as a gift.

00:30:51.260 --> 00:30:53.020
Master You, do not overthink it.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:55.180
The Chief means

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:57.460
that Elder Qiu's position

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.180
will sooner or later be yours.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:01.740
The Qinglong Altar guards the first line

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:02.980
of our Li Sect.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.860
We will rely on you even more.

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.980
Thanks to the Chief.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.580
Thanks, Mr. Yu.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.340
My subordinate, Li Yi,

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.020
has long admired your talent.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.340
Today, I'll do a small favor

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:18.780
and let him stay here

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.100
to seek guidance from you.

00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.260
(Li Yi, Li Sect)
I long for your advice.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:29.660
Master You is unwilling.

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:30.820
Then, let's go.

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:31.980
With Li's help,

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:34.260
we'll surely be like a tiger with wings.

00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:37.740
I won't fail the trust
of Mr. Yu and the Chief.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:45.420
Nonsense.

00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:46.540
Guidance?

00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:48.380
He's clearly here to spy on me.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:51.660
(Spirit Tablet of Qiu Baigang)

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.940
Father.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.100
Why are you here?

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:01.380
Darn it.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.100
Who wants to harm me?

00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:15.700
(Spirit Tablet of Qiu Baigang,
Elder Tianquan)

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:20.540
Father,

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.420
you're magnanimous.

00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:24.620
Don't blame me.

00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.410
Who?

00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:32.260
Who dares to hit me?

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:36.380
(Spirit Tablet of Qiu Baigang)

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:44.820
Father,

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.820
don't harm me.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:48.700
You're magnanimous.

00:32:59.020 --> 00:32:59.900
(Spirit Tablet)

00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.820
Father,

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:05.060
I know you died unjustly.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.300
But my life in the sect
isn't easy either.

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.340
Every day,

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.220
danger lurks everywhere.

00:33:10.333 --> 00:33:11.486
I'm like walking on thin ice.

00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.580
I'm already 31 this year,

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.700
yet I still haven't married Xing.

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.380
You don't even have a grandson.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:20.380
If you kill me,

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:21.820
there will be no one

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.780
left to worship you.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.940
Father, you're magnanimous.

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:27.820
I'll kowtow to you.

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.453

Rebel!

00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:40.380
I...

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:43.420
Get lost!

00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.740
What a jerk!

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.060
Go die!
