[Too Young To Love]

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.310
[Episode 2]

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.910
Everyone,

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.310
team up in groups of two.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.000
The winners can skip the 800-meter run.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.789
Pick your own partners.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.870
Pick your own partners.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.400
Pick your own partners.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.789
The winners can skip the 800-meter run!

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.789
Come on, three groups for the first round.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.789
Let's come up with a chant.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.120
When we move the outside foot,
we shout "one."

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.310
When we move the inside foot,
we shout "two."

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.230
So it goes: one, two, one, two...

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.120
Three, two, one.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.790
Go!

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.150
Come on!

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.510
Come on!

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.400
Tong Xiaole!

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.400
Come on!

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.150
Come on!

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.680
Come on!

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.960
One, two, one, two.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.870
Awesome!

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.120
-So amazing!
-Go for it!

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.960
Come on, three more groups.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.710
Hurry up.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.860
I can get you out of the 800-meter run.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:39.360
Ready?

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.760
Later you follow my call.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:46.910
For the outside foot, I'll shout "one."

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.120
For the inside foot, I'll shout "two."

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.190
Come on. Three, two, one.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.680
Run!

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.470
Come on!

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.030
One, two, one, two.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.430
One, two.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.750
One, two.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.960
One, two.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.870
One, two.

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:01.800
Sorry.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.840
Are you okay?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.240
Yi Lan.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.400
You're the best!

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:26.710
Give it to her.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.360
Sorry about what happened just now.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.260
Your stuff's blocking my view of my work.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.630
Stand up.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.240
Good morning, sir.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.240
Luo Ningzi...

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.079
You're not going to defend her again,
are you?

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.710
Her playing skills are just average.

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.110
I'd even say they're bad.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.520
Who's bad?

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.600
Just because I'm bad now
doesn't mean I'll be bad forever.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:06.710
Luo Ningzi.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.710
How could you say something so harsh?

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.970
We're all classmates.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.000
I'm just telling the truth.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.840
Do I

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.700
have to make up nice things

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.190
just to make you happy?

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.480
Why did you choose

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.720
the third movement
of Rachmaninoff's Symphony No. 2

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.270
as your life song?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.860
It's in A major.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.830
The melody is beautiful and melancholic.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.360
The harmonies are rich and varied.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.240
And it's one

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.970
of the most poignant
and aesthetic chapters in music history.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.120
Is that it?

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.040
Leningrad was being bombed

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.159
with hundreds of tons
of explosives every day.

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.510
To pull people through,

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.120
musicians performed this symphony

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.120
for the first time right there in the war.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.650
It made everyone believe
that they would win.

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.140
That is the power of music.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.120
That's why I tear up whenever I hear it.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.270
It's my life song too.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:03.950
I thought that having the same life song,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.880
we'd feel the same way about music.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.390
But that doesn't seem to be the case.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.450
Since you don't want to be friends
with me,

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.370
I don't want to be friends
with you either.

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.240
Faster.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.600
You know what?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.680
Joining the school orchestra
requires applying a month in advance.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.680
Because you suddenly transferred here,

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.920
not only did you humiliate Yi Lan
in front of everyone,

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.510
but you also made her lose her chance
to audition.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.370
Yet she didn't get angry about it.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.680
Instead, she recognized your ability

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.740
and respected you.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:46.680
But in my opinion,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.570
your attitude right now

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.690
doesn't deserve to be respected.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.920
This... I think

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.240
she meant to give it to you.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.120
No wonder she doesn't have any friends.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.390
You all look so lifeless.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.430
It's time to switch seats, isn't it?

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.920
Groups 1 to 4 switch seats
with Groups 5 to 8.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.310
Luo Ningzi,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.950
you should be

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.840
in Group 5.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.600
Five minutes!

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.490
Hurry up and switch!

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.030
Ning, let me help you.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.920
You leg is injured.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.480
You're in Group Five,
so you'll be Xiaole's deskmate.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.909
Thank you.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.159
Hi, deskmate.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.070
Hi, deskmate.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.380
Hi.

00:06:54.409 --> 00:06:54.750
Hi.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.120
Hi.

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.520
Hi.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.040
Hi.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.620
Are you free after school?

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.450
I want to ask you something.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.830
Okay.

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:18.600
Traitor.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.270
I'll wait for you at the school gate.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.340
Shall we go?

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.580
School's over.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.720
Aren't you going with your new friend?

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:53.520
So... you're not coming with us?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.200
What would I do there while you two chat?

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.930
Good point.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.160
I'm off then.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:00.920
Go ahead.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.720
You said it.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.750
Yeah.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.240
I'm leaving then.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:08.240
Bye.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:10.950
My new friend!

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.160
My new friend!

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360
My new friend!

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.560
He's got a new friend now?

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.830
Do those two have some kind of secret?

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.850
Come with me.

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.080
Later, let's go eat malatang together.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.200
My treat.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.049
Can you slow down a bit?

00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.600
Is your foot okay?

00:08:48.390 --> 00:08:48.990
It's fine.

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.480
I can't hear them.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.030
When did those two get so close?

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.200
They're even going home together now.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.330
Why should I believe

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.660
what you just said?

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:00.960
I mean

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.870
why I should believe

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.400
that I took Yi Lan's spot.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.280
The school orchestra

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:16.600
is basically run by students.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.660
If you don't believe this,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.640
you can go ask anyone.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.000
Why aren't you this impatient

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.320
when you talk to them?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.200
The way I talk makes you uncomfortable?

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:31.810
That's good.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.150
At least now

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.120
you know how Yi Lan felt.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:37.960
Childish.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.330
Are you okay?

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600
Yi Lan, Mengmeng,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600
what are you doing here?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.660
You disappeared right after school.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.000
Mengmeng insisted on coming here

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
to enjoy the view.

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.330
What's there to see?

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.480
It's really nice.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.440
What were you and Mengmeng

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.170
furtively looking at just now?

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.780
We were enjoying the view.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.080
The view?

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.810
What's so nice to look at around here?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.200
It's quite nice.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.690
What does it have to do with you?

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.320
Are you mad?

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.480
Why would I be mad?

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.240
I'm not mad.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:45.320
I'm not mad!

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:46.630
Fine.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
If you're not mad,

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.000
get on the bike.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:50.800
Let's go home.

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:55.510
I have legs.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.880
I can walk by myself.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.870
You think those two legs of yours

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.730
can run faster than my two wheels?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:01.550
Hurry up.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:03.870
Leave me alone.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.490
I can walk by myself.

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:07.920
You still say you're not mad?

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.200
You're clearly mad.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.200
I said I'm not mad!

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.730
Can you stop making conversation
out of nothing?

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.600
Fine.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.200
When did you

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.970
get so close to Luo Ningzi?

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.200
You know things between her and me
are awkward.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.200
You're betraying me, you know that?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.520
Do you still want to play cello with her?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.440
What does it have to do with you?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.390
Yeah.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.930
It indeed has nothing to do with me.

00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:53.200
Walk home by yourself then.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.900
You're actually leaving?

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:10.280
Do you still want to play cello with her?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.870
It's lunch break, right?

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:23.670
Alright, arrange your own time.

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:24.510
Don't erase the blackboard.

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.640
We'll continue this afternoon, okay?

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:28.120
Don't run around!

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.320
Class dismissed.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:32.850
Come with me.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.160
I need to talk to you.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:40.950
Go eat by yourself first.

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.700
Qiao Mengmeng.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:00.360
You lost.

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.000
That doesn't count.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Let's do it again.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.100
Zhao Zhenghao, let me ask you something.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.960
Are there auditions
for the school orchestra?

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:15.000
Why did you cancel Yi Lan's audition?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.860
What audition?

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:22.120
Don't tell me

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.240
you're actually sympathizing with her.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.300
It's not sympathy.

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:26.880
I want to compete fairly,

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:28.410
even if she still loses.

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.870
There's no such thing as fair competition.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:37.960
I decide who it is!

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.060
Since you're the captain,

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.610
you should consider
your members' opinions.

00:13:43.870 --> 00:13:44.600
Besides,

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.470
I was just nervous last time.

00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.200
If you've got the guts,

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.440
let me play again.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.770
Otherwise, I'll leave too.

00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:56.200
Then let's just set another time.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.720
Right?

00:13:58.870 --> 00:13:59.440
Fine.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.720
Since you want to prove yourself so badly,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.380
I'll give you another chance.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.300
Next Monday,
see you in the music room after school.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.200
Thanks.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:21.440
After school.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:23.030
See you in the music room.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.480
See you in the music room.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:35.600
Why are you smiling so happily?

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.290
I'm happy whenever you're around.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:43.930
The basketball!

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:58.600
Xiaole!

00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.080
So you're at home.

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.440
Why didn't you answer the phone?

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.900
I called you so many times.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:07.250
I didn't hear it.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.060
Move over a bit.

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.750
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.360
No.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.360
I'll cook for you in a bit.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:24.880
I need to rest for a while.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.440
Mom, I'm going out.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.290
Why are you so inconsiderate?

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.600
It's already this late,
and you're still going out?

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.660
Your mom just said she'd cook for you!

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:02.440
Are you mute?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:03.860
Say something!

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:06.790
Oh.

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:09.080
What kind of attitude is that?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.870
You never answer your mom's calls!

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:13.070
Do you know how worried she was just now?

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:13.750
Alright, alright.

00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:15.680
You always make such a mess at home.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:18.000
Every time your mom has to clean it up
after she gets home!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
It's fine, really.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.060
Alright, alright.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.550
Give it a rest.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:22.440
Give it a rest?

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.200
Today, I'm going to let him know

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.080
that I am his father!

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.240
He can't just do whatever he wants

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.200
in this family!

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.000
So you do remember you're my father!

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.200
All you care about is your lousy money!

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.550
Have you ever cared about me?

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:33.320
Have you ever been
to my parent-teacher conferences?

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.720
Have you ever cared
about what I do

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.980
or what I eat at school?

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:36.720
Look at yourself!

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.870
What right do you have to lecture me?

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:39.270
Because I'm your father!

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.320
I work my ass off to support this family!

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.650
This is how you repay me?

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.360
Stop it.

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:45.480
Stop it.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.240
Just get out.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:46.700
Get out.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:48.890
Who are you glaring at?

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.160
You ungrateful brat!

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:04.860
[Come get some fried chicken, same place]
[Come quickly!]

00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:08.470
[Okay]

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.600
It's really boring, Yi Lan.

00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.270
You're so boring.

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.110
How come you started eating without me?

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.110
It smells so good.

00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.030
Try one.

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:50.310
Have a bite!

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:56.920
Are you okay?

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.830
I'm good.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:18:59.750
I'm great.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.590
He picks on me
every time he comes home anyway.

00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:02.400
I'm used to it.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:06.830
It's okay.

00:19:06.830 --> 00:19:07.920
Don't be upset.

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:10.550
Your hands are all greasy.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:11.550
So what?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.070
Just come to me whenever you're unhappy.

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.830
Don't keep it to yourself.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:17.890
I'll stay with you.

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:19.490
Really?

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.030
Yeah.

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:24.270
What are you doing?

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.570
You're in trouble!

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.310
Xiaole, you're back.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.970
Yeah, I'm back.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.110
Mom, I'm going to sleep.

00:20:14.110 --> 00:20:15.160
You should rest early too.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:15.830
Okay.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:44.550
I'm here!

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.030
Didn't you say you were going
to do homework?

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.090
Why are you carrying your cello case?

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.310
I obviously need to practice hard.

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.550
I have to do well
at the school orchestra audition.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.400
Fine.

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:55.000
Aren't you gonna help me carry it?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.460
Just toss it in the basket.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:12.810
There's some weird noise.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:17.050
Let me check it for you.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:18.930
Give it to me.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.750
Make yourself comfortable.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.550
Someone's practicing in there.

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:45.440
She doesn't even need the sheet music.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:46.700
Pretty talented, huh?

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:50.920
Leave your cello here.

00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.780
I'll let you know when it's fixed.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.680
Thanks.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.450
No problem.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:55.350
Take care.

Why work so hard?

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.590
You'll lose to Luo Ningzi anyway.

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:47.720
Shut your trap.

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.350
I was just joking.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.070
Anyway, I just need to show

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:53.830
my true ability.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.490
I don't care about the rest.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:16.190
That's just beginner level.

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:18.200
With this,

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:20.880
she can get into our school orchestra?

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:21.920
Indeed.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:24.110
Yi Lan, your level...

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.360
What do you say, Luo Ningzi?

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.450
Her understanding of music

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:38.200
is more than qualified

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:40.640
for your school orchestra.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:42.590
What do you mean,

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:43.250
Luo Ningzi?

00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:45.270
It's okay.

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:48.110
I know everyone's really good.

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:49.680
I don't care

00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:53.110
if I can make it
into the school orchestra anymore.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.610
Zhao Zhenghao, you're such a jerk!

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.110
Let's go.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.970
Zhao Zhenghao.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.510
The school orchestra
doesn't belong to you alone.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:09.350
If the school orchestra

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.200
is full of people like you
who don't respect music

00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.200
and are arrogant,

00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:13.590
then I don't see

00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:15.720
any point in this orchestra existing.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.070
I... I didn't mean it.

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.970
Everyone, just keep practicing.

00:26:45.790 --> 00:26:46.510
Sorry.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:55.550
Mengmeng,

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.310
isn't this a bit too much?

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:59.030
You even got me a wheelchair.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:26:59.790
Absolutely.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.850
I'm terrified you'll get hurt again.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:02.830
But Lan,

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:05.690
why didn't you join the school orchestra
in the end?

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.910
Luo Ningzi is indeed excellent.

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:09.750
But at least I've proved to her

00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.830
that I'm not that bad. And that's enough.

00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:12.510
Fine.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:14.550
Anyway, you're the best in my heart.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.350
You are so sweet, Mengmeng.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.790
Of course, Lan.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.790
Why does it take so long

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.920
for Chen Fan and Xiaole to buy skewers?

00:27:34.550 --> 00:27:35.920
What exactly do you want?

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.580
Why are you always against me?

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:39.270
Don't tell me you want

00:27:39.270 --> 00:27:41.600
to be the captain of the school orchestra.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.110
I knew that was your plan.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.250
You wanted to humiliate me
in front of everyone.

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.550
Are you questioning me?

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.050
Let me tell you this.

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:00.310
Without me, the school orchestra
wouldn't be what it is today.

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:01.830
I worked my ass off

00:28:02.030 --> 00:28:04.830
to get every single instrument
in this orchestra.

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.790
To me, the orchestra

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:08.550
is my territory

00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:10.160
and my king!

00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:15.350
My kingdom!

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.310
How can you be so disrespectful?

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.070
Luo Ningzi?

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:32.310
Let's go.

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:33.720
Let's go have a look.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:35.590
I am talking to you!

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.250
Stop it, Zhao Zhenghao!

00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:43.510
Mengmeng.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.050
You called for backup?

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.030
Zhao Zhenghao, I'm warning you.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:51.110
Don't think just because we're off campus,

00:28:51.110 --> 00:28:52.110
you can do whatever you want.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:52.750
Exactly!

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:54.830
I never laid my hands on girls.

00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:57.160
But you've gone too far.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.980
You're practically forcing my hand.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.500
What are you doing?

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:04.810
This...

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:05.930
Is anyone there?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:06.920
Help!

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:09.200
-Help!
-Let go of her!

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:22.680
What kind of man

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.200
picks on three girls?

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.610
What does this have to do with you?

00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:28.110
Mind your own business.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:29.710
Of course it has to do with me.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.070
They're all under my protection.

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:34.770
When you mess with them, you mess with me.

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:37.350
Fine.

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.350
Then let's fight like real men.

00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:46.440
For real?

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:51.250
Come on.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.310
Come on.

00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.770
Come on.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.290
Come on.

00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:05.560
He's so weak.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.680
Captain Zhao!

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.680
Zhenghao!

00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:09.830
Zhenghao!

00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:10.430
Zhenghao!

00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:12.240
Help me up.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:14.680
Run!

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.750
Hurry!

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:18.510
Guys, what took you so long?

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.060
Where are they?

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.060
Where are they?

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:23.360
They called for backup too?

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:27.950
Zhenghao, they ran away.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.400
Should we chase them?

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:30.510
Of course!

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.580
After them!

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:31.990
Quick!

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:33.830
Director Hu,

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.750
it's them!

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.520
Director Hu,

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.510
they're bullying us.

00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:38.070
Are you okay?

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.600
It's him!

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:40.830
You little brats,

00:30:41.350 --> 00:30:42.110
stop right there!

00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:43.350
You punks!

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.920
Which class are you from?

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:46.200
Don't let me catch you!

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:47.350
Stop right there!

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.060
Zhao Zhenghao!

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:56.310
Stop right there!

00:31:08.110 --> 00:31:09.370
Tong Xiaole, Chen Fan!

00:31:10.750 --> 00:31:11.610
Come over here.

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.520
And you guys too?

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.910
Mengmeng,

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.200
you're such a traitor.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.680
You ran off by yourself.

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:23.830
I just went to get help.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.400
Look at you two.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:31.280
Did you really become besties?

00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:33.070
Luo Ningzi.

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:35.350
Although you don't like making friends,

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:37.200
you're still a good friend.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.000
Can I invite you

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.590
to practice cello with me after school?

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.790
After school, I usually

00:31:51.790 --> 00:31:54.450
practice in the school music room
for two hours.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.030
Oh.

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.110
But the school doesn't say

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.040
only orchestra members can use it.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:06.880
Then let's practice together from now on.

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:11.870
Together!

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.120
Let's go.

00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.920
Director,

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.310
it was him.

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:24.270
He led

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:24.960
them...

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:26.070
these guys...

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:27.800
They cornered us after school.

00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:29.000
And my leg

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.730
got injured

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.020
because of him.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.350
It had nothing to do with those two?

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.790
Nothing!

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:34.650
Nothing at all.

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:36.360
Alright.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.600
I've got the whole picture.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.260
Tong Xiaole, Chen Fan,

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.510
you two are innocent.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.390
You can go.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.590
Thank you, Director.

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:44.790
Thank you, Director.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:46.030
Director, then we...

00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.710
You can go.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.610
Stand still!

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:57.830
You guys like causing trouble, huh?

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.590
Fine.

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.000
As your punishment,
you'll clean the toilets

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:01.790
for a week!

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.640
Try playing it first.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.810
Let me take a listen.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:17.270
Stop.

00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:22.170
Count the beat in your head.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.260
You have to keep up.

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:24.950
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:25.540
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:26.150
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:26.950
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.530
Keep the tempo steady.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.270
Five, six, seven, go!

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:31.400
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.000
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:32.690
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:33.440
Da, da, da, da.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:33.830
Stop.

00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:37.550
You're falling behind the tempo a bit.

00:33:37.550 --> 00:33:39.750
You might need to practice more at home.

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.200
Separate your second and third fingers
a bit more.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.330
Curve your fingers.

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.680
Stop.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.350
You still need more practice at home.

00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:23.440
What?

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.760
Give me one.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.130
This is not for you.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.670
You have so many,
but I can't even have one?

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:28.760
Haven't you eaten enough?

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.290
Get lost.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.800
Then it must be for me.

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:39.920
It's not for you either.

00:34:41.550 --> 00:34:42.550
Then who is it for?

00:34:42.710 --> 00:34:44.190
It's for Ning.

00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:45.670
Ning?

00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.760
You call her Ning?

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.250
This morning you called me Qiao Mengmeng!

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:52.400
Mengmeng.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:53.080
Mengmeng.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.580
She's your new friend?

00:34:57.630 --> 00:34:59.190
She is my new friend,

00:34:59.550 --> 00:35:01.150
but you are my best friend.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:02.000
It's different.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.600
Then where does a best friend

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.550
rank?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.670
Ranked first.

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.480
First.

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:12.400
Only one.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:17.760
Ning.

00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:21.150
This nougat is really good.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:22.130
It's for you.

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:25.360
Thanks.
