1
00:00:10,225 --> 00:00:10,865
What?

2
00:00:12,265 --> 00:00:13,174
The deputy had an accident?

3
00:00:14,745 --> 00:00:16,851
The assailant killed in the
shootout was indeed one of Burin’s men.

4
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,048
It's a good thing Vicky is in there,

5
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:19,897
otherwise I'd be worried.

6
00:00:20,072 --> 00:00:21,467
Not only are you a great driver,

7
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:23,787
but you also have such strong determination.

8
00:00:25,505 --> 00:00:27,192
I'm so proud of you.

9
00:00:27,823 --> 00:00:30,327
My son just came back
from abroad earlier this year.

10
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:32,801
I'd like him to get to know your daughter.

11
00:00:34,013 --> 00:00:35,417
If the two of them like each other.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,724
That would be wonderful.

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,977
I never interfere in my child's private life.

14
00:01:21,862 --> 00:01:22,297
Uh...

15
00:01:22,756 --> 00:01:25,115
Congratulations on the top score.

16
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:27,456
You certainly lived up to
your reputation, Captain Tara.

17
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:30,688
How did you know?

18
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:31,343
Well

19
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:33,272
I'm your fan-club.

20
00:01:33,823 --> 00:01:34,303
Hey.

21
00:01:34,807 --> 00:01:38,267
I saw the news of Captain Tara's raid
at Pak Khlong.

22
00:01:38,493 --> 00:01:40,199
- It was so cool.
- Really?

23
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:41,610
It was so cool.

24
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:42,940
- And then...
- 021

25
00:01:44,306 --> 00:01:45,091
What are you doing here alone?

26
00:01:45,882 --> 00:01:47,076
Why aren't you talking to the others, huh?

27
00:01:47,865 --> 00:01:49,734
We're allowed to use our
real names and swap contacts now

28
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:54,860
Probably...

29
00:01:55,213 --> 00:01:56,712
Nobody wants to get to know me.

30
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,592
I’m sorry for making you feel bad.

31
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,506
That was my mistake.

32
00:02:03,073 --> 00:02:04,478
It’s totally fine.

33
00:02:05,595 --> 00:02:06,265
Well,

34
00:02:06,507 --> 00:02:07,248
you can’t

35
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,393
please everyone all the time.

36
00:02:10,025 --> 00:02:11,589
There are bound to be things we don't like.

37
00:02:11,722 --> 00:02:12,297
Hmm.

38
00:02:13,198 --> 00:02:14,905
Your mindset has improved a lot.

39
00:02:15,939 --> 00:02:18,125
But honestly, during
the training, I secretly admired you.

40
00:02:20,825 --> 00:02:21,233
Wait,

41
00:02:22,078 --> 00:02:23,162
What were you admiring?

42
00:02:23,779 --> 00:02:24,596
Oh.

43
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:26,001
you criticized me so hard.

44
00:02:26,967 --> 00:02:28,537
I wanted to run home on the very first day.

45
00:02:30,232 --> 00:02:31,764
But you made it through everything,
didn't you?

46
00:02:33,305 --> 00:02:34,125
You did a great job.

47
00:03:09,115 --> 00:03:09,924
Yay!

48
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:21,210
It’s because I’ve had great encouragement.

49
00:03:21,515 --> 00:03:22,739
That’s how I’ve made it this far.

50
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:28,158
And thank you for being so tough on me,
Instructor.

51
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,362
For making me realize that

52
00:03:31,616 --> 00:03:32,715
I am...

53
00:03:35,275 --> 00:03:36,507
Stronger than I ever thought I could be.

54
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:45,390
Cheers!

55
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:47,222
Cheers.

56
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:49,761
Uh-huh.

57
00:03:50,756 --> 00:03:51,239
Hey.

58
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,048
Drinking like that will knock you out.

59
00:03:55,565 --> 00:03:56,564
Hmm.

60
00:03:57,521 --> 00:03:58,576
In other matters,

61
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:00,730
I might not be able to compete with anyone.

62
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:02,155
But when it comes to drinking,

63
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:03,933
I'm the most confident.

64
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:05,633
Cheers!

65
00:04:05,835 --> 00:04:06,650
Bottoms up.

66
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,762
It’s already going to my head tonight.

67
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:27,316
That's not called being confident.

68
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,162
That's called being cocky.

69
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:30,579
Huh?

70
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:33,965
Then why didn't you stop me?

71
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:35,956
You were too busy talking."

72
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:38,916
So, you're not just cocky.

73
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:40,973
But you also like playing the victim.

74
00:04:45,705 --> 00:04:46,756
Hey, careful.

75
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:15,530
See? Always playing the victim like this.

76
00:05:21,382 --> 00:05:21,912
Foul

77
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:23,467
mouth.

78
00:05:36,057 --> 00:05:37,242
But you're also cute.

79
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:48,004
Hey,

80
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,521
you're talking nonsense because you're drunk.

81
00:05:51,512 --> 00:05:52,475
It's time for you to go to bed.

82
00:05:53,793 --> 00:05:54,374
Go on.

83
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,318
I don't want to go back yet

84
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:14,173
Can we go to the beach?

85
00:06:24,336 --> 00:06:25,745
Please.

86
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,429
We're leaving soon,
and haven't even gone for a swim yet.

87
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,309
Please.

88
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,417
Please. Please.

89
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:34,712
Please.

90
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:35,269
Please.

91
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:36,590
Umm.

92
00:06:37,977 --> 00:06:38,700
Ok.

93
00:06:41,239 --> 00:06:41,690
Go.

94
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:47,598
Hey.

95
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:48,339
You.

96
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:49,411
You.

97
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,393
Wait.

98
00:06:51,636 --> 00:06:52,430
Wait.

99
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,291
We're here.

100
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:06,540
Hey.

101
00:07:07,497 --> 00:07:09,346
The instructor said
we can use our real names now.

102
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:13,370
You’ve known my name since
the day I ordered that cake.

103
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,263
Umm.

104
00:07:16,093 --> 00:07:17,867
But I haven't told you my name yet.

105
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,312
So tell me then.

106
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:22,964
But if you don't want to know,

107
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,647
I don't have to tell you.

108
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:28,386
Of course I want to know.

109
00:07:29,118 --> 00:07:30,173
Come on, tell me already.

110
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:33,379
I'm Vicky.

111
00:07:34,016 --> 00:07:35,423
My real name is Phavika.

112
00:07:38,848 --> 00:07:40,022
That's a very beautiful name.

113
00:07:42,816 --> 00:07:44,039
The name Thara is beautiful too.

114
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,679
But besides just your name.

115
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:54,783
I want to get to know you much better.

116
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:06,081
Can you promise me.

117
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:08,436
That once we leave this place.

118
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:10,825
We'll still be friends.

119
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:26,025
Do you really want us to be just friends?

120
00:11:09,124 --> 00:11:10,688
Despite the toughness of this training,

121
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,952
You have all made it through with grace.

122
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:15,536
I am very pleased.

123
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:18,110
I am both happy and proud.

124
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:19,971
To have female police officers,

125
00:11:20,543 --> 00:11:22,937
who are as capable and high-quality
as all of you, serving as a vital force.

126
00:11:27,328 --> 00:11:28,427
Another matter for today.

127
00:11:29,613 --> 00:11:30,478
We are honored

128
00:11:31,716 --> 00:11:34,368
By the presence of Police General
Phakphum Ratchanon.

129
00:11:36,244 --> 00:11:38,582
Deputy Commissioner
General of the Royal Thai Police,

130
00:11:39,505 --> 00:11:40,336
To give a speech.

131
00:11:41,105 --> 00:11:43,056
And to present certificates
to each and every one of you.

132
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:46,662
All rise.

133
00:11:59,405 --> 00:12:00,999
Salute the commanding officer.

134
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:02,057
Stand tall.

135
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:05,867
Please be seated.

136
00:12:11,287 --> 00:12:12,158
First of all,

137
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:15,716
I would like to congratulate all of you,

138
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:17,251
on completing the training,

139
00:12:17,556 --> 00:12:18,928
and graduating today.

140
00:12:19,358 --> 00:12:21,681
V.I.P. protection,

141
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:26,199
is not just about physical ability alone.

142
00:12:27,681 --> 00:12:29,183
But we must use our intellect,

143
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:30,999
instinct,

144
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:33,669
spirit,

145
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:36,913
and your heart,

146
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:38,777
alongside one another.

147
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:40,712
I hope that

148
00:12:40,985 --> 00:12:43,272
you will never forget this training.

149
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:44,830
And use what you've learned

150
00:12:45,153 --> 00:12:46,593
to protect people

151
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:48,312
to the best of your abilities

152
00:12:48,985 --> 00:12:51,595
and with true professionalism.

153
00:13:05,248 --> 00:13:06,288
I would like

154
00:13:06,505 --> 00:13:08,999
to share a little something personal.

155
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:09,930
Today,

156
00:13:10,626 --> 00:13:11,547
my daughter

157
00:13:12,745 --> 00:13:13,607
is here as well.

158
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:21,130
Her code is 021.

159
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:27,805
Phavika Ratchanon.

160
00:13:46,327 --> 00:13:47,577
If, during the training

161
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,730
my daughter

162
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:52,119
has done anything to cause you trouble,

163
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,438
or made things difficult for you,

164
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,186
I sincerely apologize for that.

165
00:14:01,305 --> 00:14:03,859
Today, I'll allow everyone
to complain about her.

166
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,456
You can criticize her,

167
00:14:06,084 --> 00:14:07,047
but please, don't be too harsh.

168
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:26,881
This Saturday is my daughter's birthday.

169
00:14:27,345 --> 00:14:28,368
We're having a small celebration.

170
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:30,750
Please bring Looknam along.

171
00:14:30,887 --> 00:14:32,247
The kids can be friends.

172
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:34,199
Looknam, please come, dear.

173
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:36,830
You don't need to bring any gifts, dear.

174
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:38,866
Just coming to play with her is enough.

175
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,407
Yes.

176
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,244
- Hello.
- Oh.

177
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,103
Hello.

178
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,445
- Hello. Hello.
- Hello.

179
00:14:45,444 --> 00:14:46,801
Happy birthday, little one.

180
00:14:47,174 --> 00:14:48,093
Thank you.

181
00:14:49,545 --> 00:14:51,690
Go leave the gift with your mom first.

182
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:53,669
Then, take P'Looknam inside
to have some snacks.

183
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:54,472
- Yes.
- Please.

184
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:57,242
- Mom.
- Huh.

185
00:14:57,275 --> 00:15:00,128
P’Looknam brought me a gift
and so did the other friends.

186
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:01,411
Ok.

187
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:02,270
Wow.

188
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:06,765
your name is Looknam?

189
00:15:06,952 --> 00:15:07,530
Yes.

190
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:08,558
Hmm.

191
00:15:09,346 --> 00:15:09,885
Cute.

192
00:15:10,084 --> 00:15:11,672
The name really suits the owner.

193
00:15:12,105 --> 00:15:12,934
Thank you.

194
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:14,970
See?

195
00:15:15,505 --> 00:15:17,622
Her name is quite Thai.

196
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:19,162
It’s actually very cute.

197
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:21,808
But Nong Noo sounds so old-fashioned.

198
00:15:21,862 --> 00:15:23,349
It's old-fashioned.

199
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,266
Thank you for coming, dear.

200
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:27,968
Yes.

201
00:15:28,475 --> 00:15:32,211
Happy birthday day to you

202
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:35,776
Happy birthday day to you

203
00:15:36,063 --> 00:15:39,921
Happy birthday day, Happy birthday day.

204
00:15:39,956 --> 00:15:46,641
Happy birthday day to you

205
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:47,509
Go ahead, blow it!

206
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:50,510
Oh.

207
00:15:50,546 --> 00:15:52,865
Yay.

208
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:55,035
Be a good girl for your mom, okay?

209
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:57,906
I wish you so much happiness, dear.

210
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:03,545
- So, shall we start opening the gifts now?
- Let's do it!

211
00:16:03,865 --> 00:16:04,235
Hurry up.

212
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:09,867
- Open mine first, Open mine.
- Open mine.

213
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:12,742
- Open mine.
- Open mine.

214
00:16:12,792 --> 00:16:13,559
This one.

215
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,065
- Huh?
- Huh?

216
00:16:17,385 --> 00:16:18,531
A pencil case.

217
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,783
- It’s as cute as you are.
- And it's pink, too.

218
00:16:21,162 --> 00:16:21,719
Do you like it?

219
00:16:22,007 --> 00:16:23,310
- I love it.
- Hmm.

220
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,044
- Which one? Which one?
- This one is mine!

221
00:16:25,062 --> 00:16:26,030
Which one would you like, Nong Noo?

222
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:27,456
- Take your pick.
- Let's go with this one first.

223
00:16:31,835 --> 00:16:32,330
Whoa!

224
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,485
A storybook.

225
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:36,267
An English storybook, too.

226
00:16:36,673 --> 00:16:38,727
The title is Frog and Toad.

227
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:44,638
This one is mine.

228
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:45,876
- Umm.
- Whoa.

229
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:46,893
Do you like it?

230
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:48,436
Yeah.

231
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:57,749
Frog and Toad were best friends.

232
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,103
One day...

233
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,832
Toad was sitting in front of his house.

234
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,199
He looked very sad.

235
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,179
He said,

236
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,681
No one

237
00:17:07,808 --> 00:17:10,211
has ever written him a letter.

238
00:17:10,389 --> 00:17:11,627
Frog heard this,

239
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:13,225
so he rushed back home.

240
00:17:13,485 --> 00:17:16,051
He took out a piece of paper and wrote.

241
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:17,705
Dear Toad,

242
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:20,558
You are my very best friend.

243
00:17:20,985 --> 00:17:23,103
I am happy that you are in my life.

244
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:25,017
After that,

245
00:17:25,307 --> 00:17:25,953
Frog

246
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,747
Went to find the mail bird.

247
00:17:29,053 --> 00:17:30,217
and said,

248
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:33,204
Please deliver this to Toad.

249
00:17:34,585 --> 00:17:36,466
I want to got a letter too.

250
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:38,804
I'll send you one myself.

251
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:45,376
Smile for the camera, dear!

252
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:52,202
How was the training?

253
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,266
It's quite tough, sir.

254
00:17:54,075 --> 00:17:54,934
And how about my daughter?

255
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:55,959
She was great, sir.

256
00:17:56,377 --> 00:17:56,813
Sir.

257
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,100
Thank you very much
for being here today, sir.

258
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,623
Excuse me.

259
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:03,073
Daddy.

260
00:18:07,915 --> 00:18:08,905
I miss you.

261
00:18:09,956 --> 00:18:10,967
How are you?

262
00:18:10,993 --> 00:18:11,850
How are you?

263
00:18:22,573 --> 00:18:23,402
How are you?

264
00:18:23,657 --> 00:18:24,211
Are you doing well?

265
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,553
- Ok.
- Ok?

266
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:29,965
What happened to your hand?

267
00:18:32,463 --> 00:18:33,592
Just a minor accident.

268
00:18:34,771 --> 00:18:35,533
But it’s nothing serious.

269
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:38,626
An accident?

270
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:42,288
This is a big deal.

271
00:18:42,848 --> 00:18:44,039
Why didn't you tell me.

272
00:18:45,065 --> 00:18:47,085
You and P’X are both the same.

273
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,416
There have been so many times.

274
00:18:48,576 --> 00:18:49,752
That you've tricked me into coming here.

275
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:51,287
I still haven't settled the score with you yet.

276
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:52,318
Well...

277
00:18:52,653 --> 00:18:55,041
I didn't want you to worry,
so you could focus on your training.

278
00:18:55,444 --> 00:18:57,752
Look, I'm perfectly fine. I'm still very strong.

279
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,168
Don't you know?

280
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:00,798
Your dad is made of steel!

281
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:04,430
Hm.

282
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:06,667
Dad,

283
00:19:07,527 --> 00:19:08,712
I have someone

284
00:19:08,907 --> 00:19:10,119
I’d like to introduce to you.

285
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:11,387
Who is it?

286
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:22,567
Thank you so much for honoring
us with your presence today, sir.

287
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,130
I’ve wanted to meet you
in person for a long time.

288
00:19:25,505 --> 00:19:27,675
021 I mean, Ms. Phavika.

289
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:28,765
You are very impressive.

290
00:19:28,949 --> 00:19:31,684
I’ve known since the first day
that you were something special.

291
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:34,647
The apple really doesn't fall far from the tree.

292
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:37,844
In that case,

293
00:19:38,235 --> 00:19:39,604
let’s exchange Line contacts, shall we?

294
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:42,513
Sure.

295
00:19:44,025 --> 00:19:46,327
May we please take a photo with you, sir?

296
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:47,633
Sure thing, come on in!

297
00:19:49,509 --> 00:19:50,380
Please excuse me for a moment.

298
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,170
I’ll go fetch my friends first.

299
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:54,801
May I

300
00:19:57,047 --> 00:19:57,767
Oh, sure.

301
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,368
Hello, Vicky.

302
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,962
Congratulations!

303
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:11,894
We...

304
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,299
Do we know each other?

305
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:15,139
I'm Bawornthat,

306
00:20:15,328 --> 00:20:16,703
Minister Burin's son.

307
00:20:17,118 --> 00:20:18,152
I used to have black hair,

308
00:20:18,505 --> 00:20:19,737
but I'm looking a bit too cool now,

309
00:20:19,956 --> 00:20:21,005
so it’s red.

310
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:29,995
Ah, Minister Burin.

311
00:20:31,722 --> 00:20:32,528
Congratulations.

312
00:20:35,385 --> 00:20:36,570
How was your day? Are you tired?

313
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:38,620
Well...

314
00:20:38,973 --> 00:20:39,903
It was quite tiring.

315
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:41,136
Wow.

316
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:44,306
My son just came back
from abroad earlier this year.

317
00:20:45,426 --> 00:20:47,796
I'd like him to get to know your daughter.

318
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:50,445
If the two of them like each other.

319
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,693
That would be wonderful.

320
00:20:57,103 --> 00:20:57,909
By the way.

321
00:20:58,345 --> 00:20:59,082
Do you like flowers?

322
00:20:59,118 --> 00:21:00,119
What exactly are you doing?

323
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,873
Well, I’m just here for the party meeting.

324
00:21:06,336 --> 00:21:07,616
When my daughter opened her shop.

325
00:21:07,968 --> 00:21:09,225
You already meddled once.

326
00:21:10,457 --> 00:21:12,392
- And now, you’ve brought your son here yourself.
- Please excuse me.

327
00:21:13,127 --> 00:21:13,696
Umm.

328
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:16,659
Don't be so cynical.

329
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:19,876
I was just showing some kindness.

330
00:21:20,721 --> 00:21:21,556
I know

331
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:23,316
you're threatening me.

332
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,439
This is exactly why I suggested
that our families join together.

333
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:28,727
If we were on the same side,

334
00:21:29,512 --> 00:21:31,411
I would have no reason to threaten you.

335
00:21:32,105 --> 00:21:35,257
I can’t be on the same side as
someone who tried to have me killed.

336
00:21:36,665 --> 00:21:39,965
But didn't we used to be on the same side?

337
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,580
You know exactly why that changed.

338
00:21:42,688 --> 00:21:44,377
Stop using your old tactics.

339
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:46,347
I know

340
00:21:46,833 --> 00:21:48,718
that the opposition is coming after you.

341
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:51,862
If you don't want to end up in prison

342
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:53,450
sooner than you should.

343
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:55,533
Stay away from my daughter.

344
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:24,312
I'm Vicky.

345
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:26,315
My real name is Phavika.

346
00:22:27,331 --> 00:22:28,629
That's a very beautiful name.

347
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,333
Her code is 021.

348
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:41,402
Phavika Ratchanon.

349
00:23:26,066 --> 00:23:26,890
Hey, she's here.

350
00:23:27,705 --> 00:23:28,063
Wait.

351
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:29,447
Why are you alone?

352
00:23:30,105 --> 00:23:30,528
Yeah.

353
00:23:32,857 --> 00:23:34,641
Wasn't 021 supposed to come back with us?

354
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:36,771
She’s inside.

355
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,168
I guess she's going back with her dad.

356
00:23:41,385 --> 00:23:41,906
Let's go.

357
00:23:52,993 --> 00:23:53,565
Tarn.

358
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:54,922
- Tarn.
- Wait.

359
00:23:57,505 --> 00:23:58,128
What's wrong.

360
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:07,856
Huh?

361
00:24:09,556 --> 00:24:11,527
Is 021 really Deputy
Commissioner Phakphum’s daughter?

362
00:24:14,134 --> 00:24:14,596
Wait.

363
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:18,022
Are you two hiding something from me?

364
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:22,214
Look, it's like this.

365
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,041
Deputy Phakphum is the Deputy Chief of Police,

366
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:27,097
and Tarn doesn't really get along with him.

367
00:24:27,505 --> 00:24:29,278
But somehow, she still wants to work for him.

368
00:24:30,004 --> 00:24:31,032
That's all I know.

369
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:33,909
Tarn.

370
00:24:35,361 --> 00:24:36,063
What's going on?

371
00:24:36,496 --> 00:24:37,527
Talk to me.

372
00:24:46,226 --> 00:24:47,728
I’ve told you guys before, right?

373
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:50,484
That my dad fell to his death.

374
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:57,758
My mom and I believe

375
00:24:59,905 --> 00:25:01,225
that it wasn't a suicide.

376
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,576
Why did you do this?

377
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:25,201
- Sir, Mr. Wikarn fell and died at the scene.
- Who is going to take care of our child?

378
00:25:26,896 --> 00:25:27,660
We're processing

379
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,377
evidence to find the cause, sir.

380
00:25:36,187 --> 00:25:37,198
Mrs.

381
00:25:37,479 --> 00:25:38,119
Mrs.

382
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,750
please calm down. Stay calm.

383
00:25:41,545 --> 00:25:43,530
Phi.

384
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:48,949
Twenty years ago,

385
00:25:49,936 --> 00:25:52,436
My father was threatened by a capitalist
to sell our shophouses at a cheap price.

386
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:55,399
The villagers were terrified,

387
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:57,414
so they all gave in and sold their places.

388
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:01,379
But my father refused.

389
00:26:02,513 --> 00:26:04,582
He became the leader,
fighting back against that capitalist.

390
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:06,333
He gathered all the evidence and went to the police.

391
00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:12,620
The officer in charge of the case back then

392
00:26:14,635 --> 00:26:16,075
was Inspector Phakphum Ratchanon.

393
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:22,620
My father was in contact with him
for nearly a year.

394
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:27,450
It seemed like he was on my father's side.

395
00:26:31,939 --> 00:26:33,802
But for some reason, my father ended up dead.

396
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:39,248
Inspector, sir.

397
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:42,084
Could you please tell me a bit
more about what happened that day?

398
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:44,347
I went to see him at his house that day,

399
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:47,213
around 3 PM.

400
00:26:47,811 --> 00:26:49,233
From our conversation,

401
00:26:50,164 --> 00:26:51,307
he seemed extremely stressed.

402
00:26:52,187 --> 00:26:54,967
He was talking in circles.
It didn't make much sense.

403
00:26:55,598 --> 00:26:56,816
Maybe... well,

404
00:26:57,622 --> 00:26:58,179
he was stressed.

405
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,229
I could really feel how overwhelmed he was.

406
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,540
And then what?

407
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:06,208
He told me he couldn't take it anymore.

408
00:27:08,469 --> 00:27:09,663
He didn't want to fight anymore.

409
00:27:11,103 --> 00:27:12,087
He said if anything happened to him,

410
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:13,773
to please look after his wife and child.

411
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,712
The police concluded that
my father committed suicide.

412
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,580
But no matter what, my mom refuses
to believe he would ever abandon us.

413
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:29,725
My dad wasn't that kind of person

414
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,670
One of the reasons
I became a cop was because of this.

415
00:27:39,062 --> 00:27:40,662
I want to know what really happened,

416
00:27:43,091 --> 00:27:45,174
and I've been waiting for the moment to face him.

417
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,176
But it's freaking dangerous, Tarn.

418
00:27:49,746 --> 00:27:51,402
He’s risen so high now.

419
00:27:52,682 --> 00:27:53,894
There’s no way you can take him down.

420
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:57,574
If I were your father,

421
00:28:00,105 --> 00:28:03,174
I wouldn't want you to
risk your life and your future.

422
00:28:05,025 --> 00:28:07,705
For a truth that might not even be provable.

423
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,481
So you guys are just going
to leave me wondering like this?

424
00:28:20,065 --> 00:28:21,497
Even if I can't get revenge,

425
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:24,463
I still need to know.

426
00:28:27,032 --> 00:28:28,836
But he's 021’s father!

427
00:28:29,444 --> 00:28:29,968
Umm.

428
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:32,783
Now that you know this,

429
00:28:34,371 --> 00:28:35,939
does it make things harder

430
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:37,675
or easier?

431
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:47,930
Is she asleep?

432
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:49,859
Or she is working?

433
00:30:00,745 --> 00:30:02,516
It seems like you
really like this friend of yours.

434
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:10,333
She's a very kind person.

435
00:30:11,085 --> 00:30:13,192
And she's very gentle, too.

436
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:15,746
But when something serious,

437
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,447
she’s incredibly precise.

438
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:18,765
Just like you, Dad.

439
00:30:20,265 --> 00:30:22,004
Sometimes, I even think.

440
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:24,365
That she should be your child instead of me.

441
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:25,891
Is that so?

442
00:30:26,715 --> 00:30:27,604
And what’s his name?

443
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:30,739
Tara.

444
00:30:30,813 --> 00:30:31,707
Captain Tarn.

445
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:37,142
She's the one who helped me
at the shop that day.

446
00:30:38,638 --> 00:30:39,657
It’s unbelievable.

447
00:30:39,992 --> 00:30:41,622
It's like fate is playing a joke on us.

448
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:43,171
Crazy coincidence.

449
00:31:03,585 --> 00:31:04,288
Where are you going?

450
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:06,561
Hanging out, Pa.

451
00:31:07,331 --> 00:31:08,374
Do you expect me to just wither away at home?

452
00:31:09,189 --> 00:31:10,522
Did you go see Phakphum's daughter yet?

453
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:12,579
Already did, Pa.

454
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:13,755
She’s not even that pretty.

455
00:31:14,422 --> 00:31:15,177
And she’s not really my type.

456
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:16,377
Don't tell me.

457
00:31:16,967 --> 00:31:18,709
You prefer that old doctor lady.

458
00:31:19,731 --> 00:31:21,017
Women like the ones you prefer

459
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:22,842
are hard to control.

460
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:24,552
Find someone submissive.

461
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:25,936
They're much easier to control.

462
00:31:28,374 --> 00:31:30,223
I don’t care who you sleep with.

463
00:31:30,884 --> 00:31:32,697
But if you can make Vicky fall for you,

464
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:34,531
it’ll be to my advantage.

465
00:31:35,699 --> 00:31:36,448
You know very well

466
00:31:37,254 --> 00:31:38,813
that I’m in a tight spot right now.

467
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:42,457
If that guy Phakphum leaks
the evidence to the opposition.

468
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,072
We’re screwed.

469
00:31:45,376 --> 00:31:45,945
Pa.

470
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:47,971
Just get rid of him, Pa.

471
00:31:48,454 --> 00:31:49,488
Like you did with the others.

472
00:31:50,545 --> 00:31:51,891
He won't be lucky enough
to survive every time.

473
00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:57,319
Thank you.

474
00:31:57,636 --> 00:31:58,454
Thank you.

475
00:32:03,124 --> 00:32:03,710
Hey, Pete.

476
00:32:04,072 --> 00:32:07,082
You have to stop Tarn from
working with that Deputy, you hear me?

477
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:08,786
You've got to make it happen.

478
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:10,238
You know what.

479
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,266
Pete, I gotta go. Talk later!

480
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:17,962
P'Ann.

481
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:20,241
P'Ann.

482
00:32:21,364 --> 00:32:22,288
Are you alright?

483
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:25,331
I’m just feeling a bit dizzy.

484
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:27,660
I guess I haven’t had enough sleep.

485
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:29,725
Are you sure you’re okay?

486
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:31,971
Yeah, I'm good.

487
00:32:34,027 --> 00:32:35,479
Careful. Take a seat, slowly.

488
00:32:42,739 --> 00:32:45,121
Don’t get so caught up with
patients that you forget yourself.

489
00:32:46,976 --> 00:32:48,534
I've been clearing my schedule lately.

490
00:32:49,361 --> 00:32:51,536
I'm thinking of taking a break
and going abroad for a while.

491
00:32:52,842 --> 00:32:53,565
Hey.

492
00:32:54,395 --> 00:32:55,156
Or...

493
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:58,297
Is there a surprise proposal?

494
00:32:59,402 --> 00:33:00,179
Don't be silly.

495
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,316
I'm still very much single.

496
00:33:01,722 --> 00:33:02,110
Wait.

497
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:03,011
Then...

498
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:06,463
Who’s that guy?
The one with the glam look?

499
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:09,382
You know,

500
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:11,337
the one you went out to dinner with last week.

501
00:33:13,625 --> 00:33:14,247
Noey.

502
00:33:14,573 --> 00:33:15,927
Don't tell anyone about this yet.

503
00:33:16,273 --> 00:33:17,340
It’s not official yet.

504
00:33:20,913 --> 00:33:21,705
Got it!

505
00:33:43,284 --> 00:33:44,596
I have a favor to ask you.

506
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:47,287
It won't interfere with your main duties.

507
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:50,211
During your days off,

508
00:33:51,505 --> 00:33:53,767
I'd like you to help provide some security.

509
00:33:55,568 --> 00:33:56,564
No problem at all, sir.

510
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,727
I haven't even told you yet
who you'll be looking after.

511
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:03,841
Isn't it you, sir?

512
00:34:06,451 --> 00:34:07,287
It's my daughter.

513
00:34:07,968 --> 00:34:08,558
Vicky.

514
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:13,950
Ever since that night,
I've been very worried about her.

515
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:16,273
The reason I sent Vicky for training

516
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:18,060
was so she could learn to defend herself.

517
00:34:19,702 --> 00:34:21,053
But if someone was there to look after her.

518
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:23,909
I'd feel much better.

519
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:27,882
She trusts you.

520
00:34:30,125 --> 00:34:31,245
And I trust you.

521
00:34:38,072 --> 00:34:39,310
I've received the package, P'Mart.

522
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:40,472
Oh.

523
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,358
It’s been changed to the meeting room
on the third floor?

524
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:45,823
Which building?

525
00:34:51,749 --> 00:34:52,380
I see.

526
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:53,719
Building Three.

527
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,638
If I may speak frankly,

528
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:05,826
I don't want to spend my off-time carrying bags

529
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:08,007
for some high-society while she's shopping.

530
00:35:09,426 --> 00:35:11,251
I thought you knew my daughter well enough

531
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:12,902
not to say something like that.

532
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:18,196
Fine.

533
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:20,804
I’ll take that as a refusal.

534
00:35:28,057 --> 00:35:29,133
Okay. I'll do it.

535
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:16,469
Hey, stop.

536
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:19,053
Hey.

537
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:35,687
Mr. Bawornthat.

538
00:36:37,008 --> 00:36:37,725
Captain Tarn.

539
00:36:42,724 --> 00:36:44,356
I was just going to help Vicky carry her things.

540
00:36:46,045 --> 00:36:46,916
Do you two know each other?

541
00:36:51,065 --> 00:36:52,377
This is Mr. Bawornthat.

542
00:36:52,705 --> 00:36:54,507
Minister Burin’s son.

543
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:56,187
And this

544
00:36:56,644 --> 00:36:57,779
Captain Tarn.

545
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,008
A friend of mine

546
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:08,004
Pleasure to meet you, Captain Tarn.

547
00:37:11,402 --> 00:37:12,033
Hello.

548
00:37:13,213 --> 00:37:14,516
I'm sorry, I misunderstood the situation.

549
00:37:16,739 --> 00:37:18,182
I happened to have a meeting nearby,

550
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:20,454
so I thought I’d ask Vicky out for lunch.

551
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:23,260
I’m afraid that’s not possible.

552
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:25,127
It’s almost 1 PM already.

553
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:29,832
She's right.

554
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:31,485
I have another meeting soon,

555
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,635
and I need to deliver these items
to my seniors.

556
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:34,146
I see.

557
00:37:34,558 --> 00:37:35,257
That's fine.

558
00:37:35,918 --> 00:37:37,121
Maybe next time then.

559
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,696
I hope I'll have the honor of your company, Vicky.

560
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:43,473
And Captain Tarn.

561
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:47,553
I'm sorry if I startled you earlier.

562
00:37:53,361 --> 00:37:55,260
We'll be taking our leave now.

563
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:56,700
Let's go.

564
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:04,196
Captain Tarn.

565
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,142
Why haven’t you been answering my calls?

566
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,912
I was actually planning to go
and wait for you at your office.

567
00:38:14,945 --> 00:38:15,817
I've been really busy with work.

568
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:18,585
Still,

569
00:38:19,825 --> 00:38:20,949
don't overwork yourself.

570
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:22,318
I'm worried.

571
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:25,613
You're the one who’s more concerned.

572
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:27,947
You're on the phone without
looking at your surroundings.

573
00:38:28,345 --> 00:38:30,270
What if someone with bad
intentions was actually following you?

574
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:33,752
Hey, you...

575
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:34,567
Hey!

576
00:38:51,313 --> 00:38:51,894
Ouch!

577
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,765
Ever since that night at Vicky’s shop.

578
00:39:27,162 --> 00:39:28,149
I’ve been very worried about her.

579
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:30,976
I’d like you to help provide some security

580
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:05,281
I thought you said you were
going to stop seeing that rich girl.

581
00:40:08,545 --> 00:40:09,675
I've given it some thought.

582
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,407
Being a bodyguard for anyone
is the same thing,

583
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:16,697
As long as I can get into that house
to find evidence, that's enough.

584
00:40:17,693 --> 00:40:18,599
Don't be so stubborn.

585
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:20,913
I know you too well, Tarn.

586
00:40:22,265 --> 00:40:23,174
You’re worried about her.

587
00:40:24,285 --> 00:40:26,300
I know what happened
at the Royal Thai Police HQ today.

588
00:40:27,402 --> 00:40:28,833
And I know exactly what you know,

589
00:40:29,435 --> 00:40:30,673
That this was likely no accident.

590
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:35,790
If you're going because your heart tells you to,

591
00:40:36,493 --> 00:40:37,302
then I'm with you.

592
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,576
But if you're going because
of Deputy Phakphum,

593
00:40:41,088 --> 00:40:42,196
then I’m against it.

594
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:45,690
Because if Vicky ever finds out the truth,

595
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:48,564
She’ll think you’ve just been using her as a tool.

596
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:54,096
But I’ve had this in mind
since long before I knew her.

597
00:40:54,934 --> 00:40:56,353
She wasn't the reason I started this.

598
00:40:57,595 --> 00:40:59,684
And do you think she’ll understand that, Tarn?

599
00:41:00,505 --> 00:41:01,402
You have to make a choice.

600
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:03,204
Whether you're going to keep investigating,

601
00:41:04,265 --> 00:41:05,287
Or choose Vicky,

602
00:41:05,488 --> 00:41:06,419
And just let the past go.

603
00:41:17,447 --> 00:41:19,210
Why does she have to be his daughter?

604
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:50,193
So, this is Captain Tarn.

605
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:51,945
Oh, wow.

606
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:54,724
Who would've thought she’d be this beautiful?

607
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:56,513
Huh?

608
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:57,681
What?

609
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,992
And who exactly is she protecting?

610
00:42:02,715 --> 00:42:03,139
Huh?

611
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,256
Vicky?

612
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,857
(All eyes on Bawornthat & Vicky: Political)

613
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:24,004
(and Police heirs—the next power couple)

614
00:42:24,025 --> 00:42:24,857
Vicky.

615
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:35,447
Who is Vicky?

616
00:42:36,478 --> 00:42:36,842
Oh.

617
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:38,745
She is...

618
00:42:39,764 --> 00:42:41,025
Is...

619
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,519
Are you talking business with a foreigner?

620
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:43,530
Oh.

621
00:42:43,669 --> 00:42:44,810
Yeah, a foreign client

622
00:42:46,345 --> 00:42:48,060
You’re such a hard worker.

623
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:49,494
You never stop working.

624
00:42:50,087 --> 00:42:50,910
So diligent.

625
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:52,653
Come on,

626
00:42:53,032 --> 00:42:54,241
the folks in Europe are in a hurry.

627
00:42:55,056 --> 00:42:56,170
I miss you so much.

628
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,860
Hold on, hold on.

629
00:43:03,133 --> 00:43:04,593
And about what you said

630
00:43:05,156 --> 00:43:06,356
taking me on a trip to Europe

631
00:43:07,145 --> 00:43:08,321
when should we go?

632
00:43:10,395 --> 00:43:10,899
Look,

633
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:12,694
I'm really busy lately.

634
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:14,312
Aren't you busy yourself?

635
00:43:19,118 --> 00:43:20,128
By the way,

636
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:21,731
when did you reschedule
Deputy Phakphum’s surgery to?

637
00:43:22,285 --> 00:43:22,774
Hmm.

638
00:43:25,165 --> 00:43:26,356
I'm still looking for a date.

639
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,263
Here comes.

640
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,147
Here is the cake.

641
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:23,950
Captain Tarn.

642
00:44:24,265 --> 00:44:25,124
Captain Tarn.

643
00:44:25,488 --> 00:44:26,762
It really is Captain Tarn.

644
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:27,998
Wow.

645
00:44:28,345 --> 00:44:30,155
You’re so beautiful in person.

646
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:31,020
stunning!

647
00:44:31,225 --> 00:44:32,152
Plus.

648
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:33,829
You're so cool, too.

649
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:35,693
I’m not dreaming, am I?

650
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,159
Vicky, please tell me I'm not.

651
00:44:38,054 --> 00:44:38,466
Uh...

652
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:42,164
Uh...

653
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:44,297
I mean, I’m such a huge fan of yours,

654
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:46,232
May I take a photo with you?

655
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:47,995
Please?

656
00:44:48,374 --> 00:44:48,863
Sure.

657
00:44:49,974 --> 00:44:50,736
Thank you.

658
00:44:51,067 --> 00:44:52,030
A selfie is fine too.

659
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:55,257
One, two, three.

660
00:44:56,054 --> 00:44:57,002
One, two, three.

661
00:44:58,306 --> 00:44:59,070
Thank you.

662
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:00,570
Let me see the photo for sec.

663
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:03,465
No, no, it's not very good.

664
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:05,592
Um, Vicky, could you take a photo for me?

665
00:45:05,891 --> 00:45:07,349
Make it a good one, okay?

666
00:45:09,065 --> 00:45:10,196
Please.

667
00:45:13,265 --> 00:45:13,749
Fine.

668
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:14,822
Thank you.

669
00:45:15,316 --> 00:45:15,947
Uh...

670
00:45:16,439 --> 00:45:17,530
A normal pose is fine.

671
00:45:19,225 --> 00:45:20,670
One, two, three.

672
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:23,174
One, two, three.

673
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:25,793
Oh, can we do a heart pose too?

674
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:28,232
- Heart?
- Yes.

675
00:45:29,355 --> 00:45:29,945
Yes.

676
00:45:32,451 --> 00:45:33,998
One, two, three.

677
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:35,894
- Here.
- Thank you.

678
00:45:38,253 --> 00:45:39,204
Wow.

679
00:45:39,802 --> 00:45:41,174
The photos are so beautiful!

680
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,761
I can finally rest in peace tonight.

681
00:45:46,531 --> 00:45:47,275
Mali.

682
00:45:47,598 --> 00:45:49,299
She is a huge fan of the Captain.

683
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:53,047
I guess it's time
to change your phone's wallpaper.

684
00:45:58,798 --> 00:45:59,385
Let's go.

685
00:46:00,433 --> 00:46:00,878
Uh...

686
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:02,223
Wait a moment.

687
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:03,168
Uh.

688
00:46:03,665 --> 00:46:07,284
Did you say you didn't know Captain Tarn?

689
00:46:07,505 --> 00:46:09,420
Why are you two together today?

690
00:46:18,507 --> 00:46:19,509
Uh.

691
00:46:19,785 --> 00:46:20,356
Well...

692
00:46:21,524 --> 00:46:22,756
We met during the training.

693
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,063
Now we are...

694
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:32,182
Friend.

695
00:46:34,297 --> 00:46:35,396
It’s because of my dad.

696
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:37,654
After what happened at the shop last time,

697
00:46:37,743 --> 00:46:38,964
He’s been incredibly worried about me.

698
00:46:39,322 --> 00:46:41,328
So he assigned the Captain to look after me,

699
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:42,851
Just for peace of mind.

700
00:46:44,611 --> 00:46:46,066
I feel safe now, too!

701
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:48,054
Captain Tarn, you can come here every day.

702
00:46:48,465 --> 00:46:50,347
Even on the days Vicky doesn't come.

703
00:46:50,608 --> 00:46:52,116
You can still come by.

704
00:46:54,442 --> 00:46:55,583
I’d just be in the way.

705
00:46:55,776 --> 00:46:57,287
I'm not sure how much help I’d be.

706
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:58,777
Not at all!

707
00:46:59,065 --> 00:47:00,961
Just standing there looking cool like this

708
00:47:01,162 --> 00:47:03,153
makes the customers feel safe.

709
00:47:05,248 --> 00:47:06,958
Take it down.

710
00:47:11,725 --> 00:47:15,467
Won't there be trouble having
the famous Captain Tarn as my subordinate?

711
00:47:16,768 --> 00:47:18,330
I’m more afraid that
I’ll be the one to mess things up.

712
00:47:19,417 --> 00:47:22,697
If you mess anything up,
I’m reporting you to the Department!

713
00:47:29,385 --> 00:47:30,330
Take off your shirt.

714
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:37,213
Take it off.

715
00:47:37,865 --> 00:47:38,979
To bake.

716
00:47:39,494 --> 00:47:40,762
Weren't you going to help me?

717
00:47:42,842 --> 00:47:43,376
Oh.

718
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:45,162
Yes.

719
00:47:55,195 --> 00:47:55,799
Over there.

720
00:47:56,027 --> 00:47:56,967
Put on your apron.

721
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:18,413
Turn around.

722
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,168
Captain Tarn...

723
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:52,964
You actually have a pretty great figure.

724
00:49:01,073 --> 00:49:01,924
In this look...

725
00:49:03,571 --> 00:49:04,922
You're so cute it hurts.

726
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:11,547
Silly girl.

727
00:49:26,247 --> 00:49:26,691
Oh.

728
00:49:28,016 --> 00:49:29,121
So, is there anything I can help you with?

729
00:49:30,905 --> 00:49:32,176
I should fold these boxes, right?

730
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:55,482
I told you not to stare.

731
00:50:09,562 --> 00:50:10,466
But I want to.

732
00:50:11,056 --> 00:50:11,873
What are you gonna do about it?

733
00:50:53,847 --> 00:50:56,845
A good police must be
an enemy of bad people.

734
00:50:58,036 --> 00:51:00,327
If you're a bad cop,
you're an enemy of good people.

735
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:05,779
I thought you said you
were done with that young lady.

736
00:51:09,865 --> 00:51:11,939
The statute of limitations for that
case will expire in a few months.

737
00:51:12,999 --> 00:51:14,217
If I let it slide,

738
00:51:14,993 --> 00:51:17,287
Burin won't have
to take any responsibility at all?

739
00:51:18,004 --> 00:51:18,967
I heard...

740
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:22,173
You’ve become a bodyguard for Vicky?
