[Accounting Department]

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.840
Wu.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.310
Take a look at these for me.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.640
These are invoices from

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.280
Public Relations Department.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.430
When were they booked?

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.680
I don't remember.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.970
These guys spent a lot of money.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.680
Oh, I see.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:27.079
Mr. Sun instructed that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.310
these invoices don't comply with
the reimbursement regulations,

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.430
but their work is special,

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.320
so some costs can't be
claimed officially.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320
Just let it go.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.990
We usually don't dig too deep into
public relations expenses.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.450
But these past few months,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.730
the amounts have been getting
higher and higher.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.730
If this keeps up,
it's bound to get us into trouble.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.740
What are you afraid of?

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.540
Even if the sky falls,
the tall ones will hold it up.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.940
I’m just afraid the tall ones will duck,

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.620
and we'll get flattened.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.610
Where are you going?

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.040
I'll ask Mr. Sun for his opinion.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.150
See what we can do.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.430
Ken.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.960
Qiang.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.580
Help me check it quickly.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.890
Why haven't I got my salary this month?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:17.150
Qiang.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.590
Have a seat for a moment.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.840
I have to handle something.
We'll talk when I get back.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.420
No.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.530
I need the money urgently.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.390
Clear this up for me before you go.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.660
Then I will tell you the truth.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.520
I think you know

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.400
the reason clearly.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.470
You violated
the workshop equipment regulations

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.740
and caused two production accidents.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.360
Your salary for this month
has been deducted completely.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.150
Since Hengke was established,

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.360
I've been here.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:46.829
I've worked here for fifteen years.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:47.840
I'm a veteran here, right?

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.440
Yes.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.730
Then how can you just
deduct my salary like that?

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.610
Qiang.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.630
If you weren't a veteran,

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.430
we would have

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:56.750
let you pay for the damages.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.470
That's impossible.

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.070
You're being unreasonable.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.190
I didn't break any rules.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.930
It was a machine failure.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.950
I'm going to see Mr. Sun.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.820
Qiang.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.000
Calm down.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.410
You're retiring next year.

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:08.440
You're not in the right here.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.440
Making a scene won't do you any good.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:12.520
I see.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.120
You're behind this,

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.870
right?

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.630
You just don't want to pay me, right?

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.000
No.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:18.630
Am I right?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.769
I'm just an accountant.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.350
The money doesn't come out of my pocket.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.420
I have no reason to target you.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.000
Why are you explaining so much?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.430
Leave now, or I'll call security.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.240
Stop it.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.800
Give me my money!

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.360
Qiang!

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.270
Don't do anything rash, Qiang!

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.240
I want my money!

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.800
Help!

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.430
Calm down.

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:31.600
I want my money!

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.000
Calm down!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.750
Pay me my salary!

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.310
Help! Call the police!

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.950
Give me the money!

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:35.560
Qiang.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.480
Qiang.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.630
I know you want money.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.270
Let's talk to Mr. Sun, okay?

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.990
Don't move!

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.530
Who dares come closer?

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.750
I'll stab him if you do!

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.190
Get back!

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.000
Qiang!

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.020
Back off!

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.000
Qiang!

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.800
Qiang!

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.060
Back off!

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:50.360
Don't be rash, Qiang!

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.630
I'm walking.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:52.750
I didn't...

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.390
Stay back!

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.680
Think of your wife and kids!

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.680
Qiang!

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:19.480
Wang Ping.

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.120
Wenjing,

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.230
why are you here?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.160
What happened?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.130
We got a report.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.960
They said...

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.909
Protect the scene.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.070
He walked me from
downstairs to the stairwell across.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.770
Just like this,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.910
we backed up the whole way.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:01.870
He had me by the neck

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.390
and held scissors to my throat.

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.000
Once we got here,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.270
he didn't allow anyone to come over

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.200
but stand there.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:07.720
When we got here,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000
he pushed me away.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.630
He muttered to himself,

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.820
and then jumped.

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:13.430
I didn't even touch him.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.680
I really didn't push him.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.700
He jumped on his own.

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.030
Wu and the others saw it.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.190
Yes.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.370
He jumped on his own.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.560
Before he jumped,

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.160
what was he muttering about?

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.830
He said something like,

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.270
"I'm sorry to my wife and kids,"

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.270
and "I can't go on living like this."

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.400
He said these words.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.690
Do you guys know

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.920
if he had any recent changes

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.920
in his life or work?

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:35.920
Changes?

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.430
He made two mistakes at work this month.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.230
His entire salary was deducted.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.950
But one month's salary isn't much.

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.550
It's not worth jumping over.

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:44.320
Ken.

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.620
Relax, don't be so nervous.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.680
There are so many witnesses here.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.040
You won't be wrongly accused.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.120
I want to relax

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:50.430
but my...

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:51.970
My legs are still jelly.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:53.040
It's okay. Don't be scared.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.190
I'm just asking routine questions.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:55.480
Think again.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.130
Was there anything abnormal
about him lately?

00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:59.710
Nothing abnormal.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.200
He's a gentle person.

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:02.480
I don't know

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.210
why he suddenly went mad today.

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:06.560
I don't know if this counts.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.510
The moment he pushed me away just now,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.360
he whispered,

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.600
"Sorry, Ken."

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.190
He said it very calmly.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:14.770
Just one sentence?

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:15.690
Yes.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.850
Write that down.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.450
Alright, we're done here.

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:19.240
Who is the factory director?

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.190
Anyway, if there's any news later,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:21.040
please contact us.

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.510
Let's check the surveillance footage.

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.510
I'm leaving, bro.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:44.950
Qiang.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.950
What happened to you?

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.480
Master Liu.

00:07:50.159 --> 00:07:51.159
Liu Qiang

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.430
is a veteran here.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.350
His work used to be fine.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.000
But this month,

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.260
he made two basic mistakes,

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.720
causing significant losses to the factory.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:04.480
Since our factory

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.600
has always
had a people-oriented philosophy,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.270
and he's a veteran,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:10.210
we only symbolically docked his pay.

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:11.940
We didn't punish him severely.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:14.030
We asked him to get a checkup,

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.930
but he refused.

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:29.260
Stop banging on the door.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:29.770
Stop banging!

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:30.440
Quiet!

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.270
I'm hungry.

00:08:35.270 --> 00:08:37.000
I know you're hungry. Sit down.

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:37.320
Sit down.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.450
I bought groceries.

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:40.309
We'll have dinner soon.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:43.870
Jiajia.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.320
Jiajia.

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.690
Wake up.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:48.960
It's time to eat.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:51.840
Look at the time.
Why are you still sleeping?

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.770
Aren't you going to sleep tonight?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.150
Wake up.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.630
Jiajia.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.440
Jia.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:07.960
I'm calling you.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.600
I'm hungry.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.600
I know. Sit down.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:29.530
Sit down.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.080
Kidney function should be maintained

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.610
to reduce the impact of uremia on
lung tissue.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.390
Let's get her admitted first.

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.770
We'll use antibiotics
and nebulizer treatment

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.590
to see if we can
get the condition under control.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.990
I'm counting on you, sir.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.510
Don't worry.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.440
Uremia complicated by lung infection

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.300
is a fairly common complication.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.670
We have extensive experience treating it.

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.870
Jiajia's condition isn't too serious.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:03.750
Go pay the fees.

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.330
Director, there's something else
I'd like to discuss.

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.270
She was supposed to
have the surgery last time.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.360
But since

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.490
there was no kidney source,
she didn't have the surgery.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:18.710
Can the cost of

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.410
hospitalization and treatment this time

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:23.950
be deducted from
the surgery fee I prepaid?

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.150
If it's not enough,

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:26.080
I'll

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.430
make up the difference.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.550
These are two separate things.

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:31.720
The money you paid last time
has nothing to do with this.

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.630
Okay. I see.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:36.600
How about this?

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.030
Go apply for a refund of the surgery fee.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.110
The application takes a long time.

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:45.510
I will tell you the truth.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.390
I don't have enough money now.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:55.000
Don't go to the billing counter.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.150
Go straight to the Accounting Department.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.340
I'll call them

00:10:57.370 --> 00:10:59.420
and explain your situation in detail.

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:00.650
They should be able to accommodate you.

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.440
Okay, okay.

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:03.230
Thank you, Director.

00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.760
Go ahead.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.260
69.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.360
Have you done these questions before?

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.120
No.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.020
Then how did your score go up again?

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.480
You didn't cheat, did you?

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.870
It's a mock exam for
the postgraduate entrance examination.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:30.870
I did it for myself.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:32.600
Is there any point in cheating?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.750
I told you before that

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:35.880
what really matters

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:37.590
is finding the right method.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:39.230
I'm on the right track now,

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.510
and I have endless energy.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:41.390
What method?

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:45.670
I can't tell you.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.510
We're not even applying to
the same school.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:50.640
Do you really need to guard against me?

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.360
I'm not guarding against you.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.090
I'm afraid you won't be able to
control yourself.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:58.200
What do you mean?

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.780
I can only spare you three.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:20.200
What's this?

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.320
I got these through a special channel.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:25.750
To be honest,

00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:27.630
they contain stimulants.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:29.890
But you must control the dosage

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.070
because it's addictive.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:32.740
Take at most one a day.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:35.660
Stimulants?

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.180
Give them back if you don't want them.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.200
We're classmates.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.530
I don't want to harm you.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.590
Taking too many isn't good.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:48.910
Once your scores improve,

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.310
after two months at most,

00:12:50.390 --> 00:12:51.510
you must quit.

00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:54.670
And only those with

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:55.840
very strong willpower

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:56.790
can quit.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.090
I've been taking the postgraduate exam
for three years.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:12.130
I kept trying despite repeated failures.

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:14.130
Who has stronger willpower than me?

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.510
Isn't this just ordinary coffee candy?

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:21.770
Keep it in your mouth.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.120
Wait until it melts,
and you'll understand.

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:27.720
Three for 300 yuan.

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:28.630
Pay me.

00:13:30.070 --> 00:13:31.080
I have to pay?

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:33.430
Duh.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:37.420
Give me a discount?

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:40.240
One pill a day.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.480
You'll spend 3,000 yuan a month,

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.680
and only 6,000 yuan for two months.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.150
It can help you
get into your dream college.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.210
Is that expensive?

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:29.960
You're back.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.220
Yes.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.010
What are you smiling about?

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.420
Dinner is ready.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:02.320
When we were messaging today,

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.000
an old colleague at my company...

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.200
I've been studying really well lately.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.710
I'll definitely get an offer next year.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:14.450
Really?

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.790
I've never seen you this confident.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:22.810
By the way,

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:24.400
what were you saying just now?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.130
What happened at your company?

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:27.710
Nothing.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.790
As long as we get over
this hurdle smoothly,

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.240
life for the two of us

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.710
will definitely get better and better,

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.230
right?

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.240
Stop grinning like an idiot.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.170
Wash your hands.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.430
Sis.

00:15:57.510 --> 00:15:58.840
Thanks for everything.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.160
How much is this milk tea?

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:49.960
260 yuan.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.240
What about the candy?

00:16:53.770 --> 00:16:54.630
50 yuan a piece.

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.420
What a rip-off.

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:03.730
How many grams of drugs

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.170
are there in this candy?

00:17:05.589 --> 00:17:06.880
About 100 micrograms.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.220
One gram sells for 500,000 yuan.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.460
What's the raw material cost?

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:17.190
Over 3,300 yuan.

00:17:25.849 --> 00:17:27.250
That day at Black Forest,

00:17:27.670 --> 00:17:28.870
how many did you want?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
450 grams.

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:31.310
450 grams.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.340
That's over 100 million yuan.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.480
What good is all that money?

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:40.220
The contact got caught.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.850
The police must have got the goods.

00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:47.040
I followed Hu Wenjing that day.

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.970
I heard their words that

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.190
the suspect died

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.760
but the drugs weren't found.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:56.310
Why didn't you tell me

00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:57.790
this important information?

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:58.920
You didn't ask.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.780
Forget it.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.520
If the police can't even find it,

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:31.570
how are we supposed to?

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.960
I used a backup account

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.480
to buy some things online.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.320
The address and phone number are fake.

00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.440
It hasn't arrived yet.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.440
When it arrives,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.820
go pick it up for me.

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:46.470
I need to see Daquan as soon as possible.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.250
Can I try this?

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.360
Sure.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.270
Any side effects?

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.240
You'll die.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:08.810
You must be joking.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.780
So many people have drunk it.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:12.250
Are they all dead?

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.320
Not if you don't overdose
in the short term.

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.480
But this hallucinogen is terrifying.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:19.360
Different people

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:21.080
have different reactions.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:28.310
At first, it brings
euphoria and confidence,

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.840
and even hallucinations.

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.560
Once you're addicted,

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.160
you'll suffer insomnia,

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:38.830
anorexia,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.930
and weight loss.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.400
It will make you lose your judgment,

00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.880
change your brain structure,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.310
distort your perception,

00:19:45.310 --> 00:19:46.770
and ruin your personality

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.510
until you truly believe that

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:49.720
it's a good thing

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:50.940
and can never quit it.

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.550
In the end,

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:55.700
you'll suffocate,

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:56.850
go mad,

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.280
become depressed,

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:00.230
and have cardiac arrest.

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:08.960
Anyway,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.480
I never take it.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.830
If you don't believe me,

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.900
you can try it.

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:37.620
Liu Qiang committed suicide?

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.030
What...

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.990
How is that possible?

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:44.960
Look at the time.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.880
Why are you still making noise?

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.750
Go to bed, now.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:53.520
Liu Qiang committed suicide?

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:55.590
Is that true?

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.550
Yes.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.500
When was the last time you saw him?

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:58.870
I...

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:00.800
I texted him a couple of days ago

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.200
about your blind date with his nephew.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.680
I mean meeting in person.

00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:04.880
Meeting him?

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.730
I haven't seen him for over a month.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.640
When you last met him,

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.570
did you notice anything abnormal?

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.550
Nothing abnormal.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.000
Before,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.030
I used to ask him to go to
the foot massage parlor.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:21.160
But the last few times I asked,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:22.220
he didn't come out.

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:27.000
When you last saw him,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:27.540
did you

00:21:27.790 --> 00:21:29.240
notice any injuries on him,

00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.830
or maybe needle marks?

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:33.150
You didn't pay attention to that, right?

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.200
I didn't pay attention to that.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.160
I think there weren't any injuries.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.220
Are your questions

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.880
related to Liu Qiang's death?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.480
No, just curious.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.400
I remembered you knew him,

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.600
so I'm just checking.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:42.920
My god.

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.540
By the way, Dad.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.350
It's not safe around here lately.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.240
Don't eat anything when you're out.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.590
If you need food or drinks,

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.960
go to big supermarkets.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.830
If you're really not sure,
bring it back for me to check.

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:56.640
I can protect you now.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.720
If anything happens, you must tell me.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.480
Don't worry.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.030
I know

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.980
what I shouldn't do.

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:02.780
That's right.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.150
Don't leave.

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:07.480
You have to remember that

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.530
you have parents and kids

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.630
who are all waiting for you to come back.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:11.150
I know.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.650
Know your limits on your missions.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.030
Don't push yourself so hard.

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.640
Whether you catch the criminal or not

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.590
isn't that important to us.

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.710
If you don't catch criminals this time,

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.640
you'll have the chance next time.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.550
But do you know what matters most?

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.880
We all want you to come home safe,

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.790
my girl.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.350
I see.

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.400
I know what I'm doing.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.240
Don't worry.

00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.400
Finish washing up and go to sleep.

00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400
Remember that.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.220
Okay.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:54.780
I'm going for a smoke.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.220
Going for a smoke?

00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:03.270
Not allowed in the ward.

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:04.200
In the corridor?

00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.510
Okay.

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:09.030
Ma'am?

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:09.900
Ma'am?

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.190
Please help keep an eye on my child
for a while.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:12.300
Okay. Go ahead.

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:16.880
Hungry.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:18.920
Xiaoyu is hungry.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.120
I want to eat.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.780
I'm hungry.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.570
One, two, three, four, five.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.270
Five!

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:29.070
Five!

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.980
I counted to five!

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.710
Jiajia.

00:23:45.410 --> 00:23:46.640
I've been watching you two for a while.

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.390
Smoking isn't allowed in the hospital.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:49.150
Okay.

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.480
Actually, I quit smoking years ago.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.320
Okay.

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:06.450
How old is your son?

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:08.580
Not yet ten.

00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.790
How old is your daughter?

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:10.550
About the same.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.210
She's nine.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:13.590
What does she have?

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.030
Uremia

00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.580
with a secondary lung infection.

00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:21.590
Once the pneumonia is cured,

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.160
she just needs a kidney transplant
for the uremia, right?

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:24.800
Yes.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.240
But

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.680
we need a donor kidney.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.740
We're currently waiting for a match.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:31.990
Why don't you and your wife have a try?

00:24:31.990 --> 00:24:35.050
Direct relatives are usually good matches.

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:36.370
My wife passed away.

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.790
I have chronic glomerulonephritis.

00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.300
I'll end up with uremia
sooner or later too.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:51.680
What about your son?

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.240
What does he have?

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:57.360
Congenital heart disease.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.070
He caught a cold a couple of days ago,

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.730
and we had to rush him to the ER.

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:04.110
Will surgery work?

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:07.170
The doctor said the cold caused

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.200
a severe lung infection.

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.470
He's not strong enough
for surgery right now.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.230
They implied a few days ago

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.310
that my son

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.600
might die this time.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.740
He'll recover slowly.

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:26.680
Yeah.

00:25:30.060 --> 00:25:31.690
I probably shouldn't say this,

00:25:31.690 --> 00:25:33.720
but sometimes I think

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.260
it might be better if he just passed away,

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:39.330
which can end his suffering.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.040
Treating him these past two years

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.400
has wiped out our savings

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.730
and left us deep in debt.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.310
They say there are no filial sons

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.370
at the bedside of the long-term sick.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.030
Look at these two kids.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.530
Both have lung infections.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.400
Both are complications.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:06.440
And they're in the same ward.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.070
It's fate.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:07.720
Yes.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.350
If anything happens,

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.480
let's look out for each other.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.310
Definitely.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.960
Hello.

00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.190
Is that Cheng Ken?

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.710
Yes.

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.370
I'm from the Neighborhood Committee.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.070
Someone's been screaming
in your apartment.

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.000
Is a child trapped in the bathroom?

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:28.330
We are going to pry the door open.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:29.180
No, no, no.

00:26:29.270 --> 00:26:29.880
Don't pry it open.

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.550
That's my family.

00:26:30.550 --> 00:26:31.200
Don't freak her out.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.240
I'll be right back.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.080
Bro, please keep an eye on
the child for me.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.270
I have an emergency at home.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.220
Okay, okay.

00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.720
Don't worry.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:41.310
Okay.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:26:58.000
Letting her out.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.080
It's troublesome.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:26:59.970
Mrs. Wang,

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:01.270
Mrs. Zhang, I'm sorry.

00:27:01.270 --> 00:27:01.680
Sorry.

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:02.200
Sorry for coming back late.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:02.960
Cheng Ken.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.890
Why is there a mental patient
living in your house?

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.370
It's my niece.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.090
She just moved here.

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:10.310
I have to take care of her for a while.

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.960
Sorry.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:12.400
Will

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:13.590
she come out and hurt others?

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.070
No, she won't.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:15.310
She is young.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.440
Only fifteen years old.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.270
She's usually quiet.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.070
I always kept a close watch on her.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.880
I don't know what happened today.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.310
I took Jiajia to the hospital just now.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.030
It was urgent.

00:27:21.030 --> 00:27:21.750
She might be hungry.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.350
Sorry.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:22.720
Sorry.

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.800
It won't happen again.

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.680
Sorry for the disturbance.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.640
Please go home.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.510
Okay. Let's go.

00:27:27.530 --> 00:27:28.620
Sorry.

00:27:35.790 --> 00:27:36.940
Stop knocking.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.680
Stop knocking.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:44.200
What are you screaming for?

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:45.160
Why are you screaming?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.200
I'm hungry.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.030
Stop screaming.

00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:48.480
Shut up!

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.610
Scream again, and you will get no food!

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.370
I want meat.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.180
I want meat.

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.200
Eat this first.

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.070
It's yummy.

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:05.750
Sit.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:06.640
Sit down.

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.200
Sit down.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.180
I'll get you some meat.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.550
Do you like it?

00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.250
Is it good?

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.830
You're back.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.060
How is she?

00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:33.240
Everything's fine.

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:37.960
Dr. Yang came by earlier.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.720
He's my classmate.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.880
He works here.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:43.110
It's good to know people in the hospital.

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:44.260
Dr. Yang said

00:29:44.790 --> 00:29:46.400
he had checked on Jiajia.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.550
Her fever has gone down.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.920
She's fine. Don't worry.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:49.590
Okay.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.880
Thank you.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:51.790
No problem.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:54.610
What should I call you?

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.530
My surname is Cheng.

00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:58.920
Cheng Ken.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:00.670
Cheng means a bright future.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.680
Ken means diligence.

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:04.670
My surname is Xue.

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:05.920
Just call me Old Xue.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.880
Mr. Xue.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:07.500
Thanks.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:08.600
Take a break.

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.270
Okay.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:11.070
Dad.

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:12.550
Where have you been?

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.880
Xiaoyu is at home.

00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:17.760
She was hungry.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.680
So I got her something to eat.

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:21.130
It's okay. I'm not leaving.

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.460
I'll stay here with you.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:23.440
Alright.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:24.480
Get some sleep.

00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:38.870
Her lungs are recovering fast.

00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.820
She can be discharged
after this morning's IV drip.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:44.510
Take the child home.

00:30:45.270 --> 00:30:47.000
Come back if anything happens.

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.590
That way,

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:51.360
it can lighten your burden.

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.650
Director, I still want to ask about

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:55.980
the kidney transplant.

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.750
Roughly when

00:30:57.750 --> 00:31:00.270
will it be our turn?

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.480
Haven't I explained this to you?

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.850
It's not up to the hospital.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.380
I can't say for sure either.

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.710
I understand that.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.880
But please understand me.

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.920
I don't want to keep bothering you.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.800
But just waiting like this is torture.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.590
I'm also afraid

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:18.240
that some complications might pop up.

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:19.990
Mentally

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:21.160
and financially,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.680
I can't take it anymore.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.780
But without a donated kidney,

00:31:24.930 --> 00:31:26.260
I can't speed things up.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.680
Didn't I tell you that

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.540
as long as there's a suitable kidney,

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:32.670
scheduling the surgery is easy?

00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.920
Alright, relax.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.690
Jiajia is already

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.460
at the top of our hospital's list.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:42.430
Many patients

00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:45.300
aren't even physically fit for surgery.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:52.830
I understand.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.000
Mrs. Xue.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.960
You haven't had breakfast, right?

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.400
I bought some for you.

00:32:07.050 --> 00:32:07.920
I already had breakfast.

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:08.440
No.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.720
We can't accept this.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.200
No, no.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:10.920
Let me express my gratitude.

00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.400
Mr. Xue helped me a lot.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.750
It's just a small token.

00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:14.480
Thank you.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:15.740
How are things lately?

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:17.680
Let's check your blood pressure.

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.590
Same as always.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.070
It takes time.

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.400
You have to take it slow.

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.200
Can I see his medical record?

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.200
Since Jiajia also has a lung infection,

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:29.310
I want to see what meds he's on.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.480
Here you are.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:32.080
All of these are his records.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:32.830
Yeah.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.580
So many medicines.

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.070
Yes.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:37.700
But the two kids' conditions

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000
are definitely different.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:39.680
Yes.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:41.310
Go wash up quickly.

00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:42.110
It's not crowded now.

00:32:42.110 --> 00:32:42.920
Mr. Xue.

00:32:43.290 --> 00:32:43.900
Look,

00:32:43.930 --> 00:32:45.510
Jiajia's father brought us breakfast.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:46.030
Thanks.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:46.480
It's okay.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.080
It's just something simple.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.400
Haven't you left yet?

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:23.460
What are you doing?

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.170
Jiajia is amazing.

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:31.510
You are going to leave here.

00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:32.180
That's the way.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.240
Go home when you're well.

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:34.830
No need to stay in the hospital
if you're not sick,

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.400
right?

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:38.680
I really envy you.

00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:41.230
He'll get better in time.

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.840
Yes.

00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:43.170
My boy will recover soon,

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:43.800
right?

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.560
By the way,

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.070
I'm going to get some food.

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:48.000
Can you keep an eye on my son for me?

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:48.720
Do you have time?

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:49.720
Yes. We're not leaving yet.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:51.270
The Director wants to talk to me.

00:33:51.270 --> 00:33:51.930
Okay, okay.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.750
I'll come back quickly.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:53.810
It's fine, no rush.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:56.880
Jiang.

00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.000
I come for dialysis every week.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:00.960
I'll bring you something fun next week.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.270
I have picture books at home.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:05.000
You can use colored pens

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.060
to color the images in picture books.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.900
Do you know how to play?

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.550
What is Huarong Path?

00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:19.920
I'm not very good at it.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:25.400
Hello, Uncle Yang.

00:34:25.420 --> 00:34:26.130
Jiajia,

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.020
eat light meals when you get back.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:28.880
Okay.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:30.600
Light meals.

00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.159
How are you feeling today, handsome?

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:32.830
Put your shoes on.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:33.290
Come on.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:35.670
I'm going to draw some blood

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:36.659
for a checkup.

00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.280
Come here.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.600
Are you scared of blood draws, Jiang?

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:42.330
Actually, a little bit.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.630
A little bit, huh?

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:03.840
Xiaoyu.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:06.360
Xiaoyu.

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:09.150
Xiaoyu.

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.920
What is Xiaoyu doing?

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.760
Xiaoyu.

00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.150
Dad bought me a new puzzle.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.410
Let's put it together.

00:35:18.810 --> 00:35:20.870
I will give it to Jiang when it's done.

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:27.080
Look.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.320
This is a blueprint.

00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:35.730
Thanks, Xiaoyu.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.750
What's up?

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.280
Nie has already

00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:52.240
finished Liu Qiang's autopsy report.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.500
It's just as we guessed.

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.030
He did take hallucinogens.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.160
And it's a new state-controlled substance.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.840
Didn't the City Bureau say

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:02.840
what Ding Lai bought is

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.700
the new drug from the foreign lab?

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.370
Now everything matches up.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.110
Okay.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:07.840
Listen.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.500
Don't report to Director Dai.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:11.030
Let's go to Liu Qiang's home again
tomorrow

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.070
to see if we can find any other clues.

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:16.760
I just finished reporting to Director Dai.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.290
Why are you so quick to talk?

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:19.070
Well,

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.440
Director Dai takes this case
very seriously.

00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:21.590
He specifically told me

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:23.650
to notify him immediately
if there were any results.

00:36:23.650 --> 00:36:24.300
Besides,

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.320
why don't you want me to tell him?

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.360
When Director Dai is informed,

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.770
he'll report it to the City Bureau.

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:30.790
Will we still get to keep this case then?

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.020
I think

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.320
sometimes we should

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.840
stick to the rules.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:35.880
You're so timid.

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.210
What kind of cop are you?

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.590
You're not even as brave as my two sons.

00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.230
Hang up now.

00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:40.560
Don't waste my battery.

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:46.820
[Nuanfeng County Public Security
Bureau Committee]

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:53.360
Come on. Right here.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:56.810
Stop what you're doing, everyone.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.960
Let me introduce you.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:01.930
This is Officer Jin Longzheng

00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:04.930
from the Municipal Narcotics Unit.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.120
Qin,

00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.870
you two know each other, right?

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.800
You've worked on missions together.

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.660
That is Tan Jie,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.700
Wang Guangming,

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.820
Li and Sun.

00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:14.040
The City Bureau

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.890
takes this case very seriously.

00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:18.260
They hope that through Liu Qiang's case,

00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:20.610
we can uncover the drug dens in Nuanhai

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.150
and wipe them out in one go.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.710
Then, for this case,

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:23.970
we're counting on you.

00:37:24.550 --> 00:37:27.150
I hope that while ensuring your safety,

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.610
you can solve the case
as soon as possible.

00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:30.710
Just in time.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:31.610
Are you looking for me, Director Dai?

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:32.780
Let me introduce.

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:33.840
This is Officer Jin Longzheng

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.320
from the Municipal Narcotics Unit.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:37.760
To solve the case quickly,

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.880
I specially allocated

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.810
other police forces to assist you.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.970
This is Hu Wenjing from
our county Criminal Investigation Team.

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:44.920
She's a veteran detective.

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.050
Hope we can have great collaboration.

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.230
Come on.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:52.060
Welcome.

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.540
I reviewed Liu Qiang's case.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.810
I want to confirm a few things

00:37:57.810 --> 00:37:59.470
and plan to visit his home now.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.520
Okay.

00:38:01.150 --> 00:38:01.680
Alright.

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:03.630
We'll go there right now.

00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:06.650
Did you hear that?

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:07.810
Qin said

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.070
we'll go there right now.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.320
You go and assist them,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:11.520
showing them the way.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.030
After all, no one is

00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:14.030
more familiar with every area

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.350
of our county than you,

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:15.960
right?

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:34.880
Liu Qiang lived in Room 201, Unit 2.

00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:35.950
Let's go.

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:37.190
Room 201, right?

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.630
Yes.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.410
You don't need to come with us.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.550
Why?

00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:42.270
This is a narcotics case.

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:43.490
We won't trouble you.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:10.510
Let me ask you.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.890
You know nothing at all

00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:15.310
about your husband Liu Qiang's drug use?

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:16.040
Stop asking.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.450
I don't know anything.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.400
She said

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.950
she doesn't know anything.

00:39:23.970 --> 00:39:24.840
So you know something about that?

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.480
Yes.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.440
Then tell me.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:28.020
My uncle

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.610
committed suicide, right?

00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:32.400
How did he become a suspect?

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:33.510
Who did he hurt?

00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:34.320
Tell me.

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.330
Listen to me.

00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:38.550
I am currently questioning
the suspect's family

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.940
on site in accordance with the law.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.070
Do not interfere with our investigation.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:43.440
And you are not
Liu Qiang's immediate family.

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:45.970
I'm asking you to
leave the inquiry scene now,

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.550
okay?

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:47.320
This is my uncle's house.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:48.320
Why should I leave?

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:49.190
Leave.

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.590
I'll say it one more time.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.000
I'm asking you to
leave the inquiry scene now.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:53.920
If you don't follow my order,

00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:56.110
I will take coercive measures against you.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:56.660
Understood?

00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.510
Coercive measures?

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.190
I... I'm telling you.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.070
I doubt your identity.

00:39:59.070 --> 00:39:59.670
I'm telling you.

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:01.150
Give me your badge number.

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:01.590
I'll call 110

00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:02.320
to verify it.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:03.700
I have shown you

00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:04.280
my ID

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.760
and search warrant, haven't I?

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:06.110
Fake.

00:40:06.110 --> 00:40:07.320
Couldn't they be fake?

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.480
There are so many scammers
and fraudsters nowadays.

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:09.110
You look scruffy.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:09.800
You don't look like a good person.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.730
I'm telling you.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:12.480
You're just making trouble.

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:12.880
Jin.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:13.280
Come here.

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:13.550
What are you doing?

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:14.030
Take him outside.

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.840
You want to hit me, right?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.280
Come on.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.140
Don't touch me.

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:17.090
Don't touch me!

00:40:18.110 --> 00:40:18.710
Don't touch me!

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:19.510
What's wrong?

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:22.670
Yang Xinyu, come out for a second.

00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:23.670
Let me talk to you.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.900
This is the police.

00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:36.560
Don't get excited. Just calm down.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:40.810
My uncle committed suicide.

00:40:41.310 --> 00:40:43.310
You came to search as soon as he died.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:45.180
Can my aunt handle this?

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.180
Besides, if the neighbors see this,

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.280
they'll think my uncle did something

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.070
horrible and unforgivable.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:50.250
How can my aunt live here?

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:51.080
I understand.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.190
But your uncle used drugs.

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:54.520
It's not a small matter.

00:40:55.070 --> 00:40:56.280
We know

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.380
what kind of person your uncle was.

00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.260
Like my dad,

00:40:58.290 --> 00:41:00.020
he was just an ordinary worker.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.880
So who pushed him down this path?

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:02.900
Don't we need to find that out?

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.370
Only then can we
give your aunt an explanation.

00:41:05.370 --> 00:41:06.410
I get that.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.830
The point is that
this police officer has a bad attitude.

00:41:09.830 --> 00:41:11.750
He was just following procedure.

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:13.000
Who knows

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:14.510
whether he just used drugs himself,

00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:15.840
or he also sold drugs?

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.240
We can't say for sure yet.

00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.140
Selling drugs?

00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:18.980
Could he do that?

00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:19.490
No way.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:21.110
Is that even possible?

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:21.760
Whether it's possible or not,

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.710
we have to investigate thoroughly

00:41:22.710 --> 00:41:23.960
to clear his name.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.480
Right?

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.960
Think it over carefully.

00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:28.960
See if you can remember

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.880
any valuable information

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.630
and tell us.

00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:33.660
It's better for everyone
if we solve this case soon.

00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:37.280
My uncle

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:38.760
didn't drink.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.210
But recently,

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.010
he went to a bar

00:41:41.710 --> 00:41:42.950
frequently.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:44.430
What bar?

00:41:48.830 --> 00:41:56.480
