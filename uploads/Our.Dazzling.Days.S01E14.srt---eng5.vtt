[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.740
[Episode 14]

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.680
Sit down, please.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.640
So...

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.210
What should we do, Xiaoman?

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.520
No need to give this much compensation.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.360
Seriously?

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.490
I'm even worried this won't be enough.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.450
You can't pay it yourself.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.030
Take this.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.730
Just put it away.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.840
Take it.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:01.400
No need.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.910
No, I can't let you pay this by yourself.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.260
Take it.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.520
You keep it.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.360
I have enough.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.310
I have enough.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.520
It's okay. Don't worry about this.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.150
When we get there, be polite.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.310
Don't just go there

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.710
and act like a fool.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.770
C-Call them bro
or whatever is appropriate.

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.910
Apologize properly and be respectful.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.960
I didn't expect it

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.510
to turn out like this.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.490
"Summer Vacation Plan for Shanghai"?

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:32.329
What's this?

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.990
Forget about that thing.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.700
After you pay this,
how are you supposed to go to Shanghai?

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:38.550
I'm not going to Shanghai.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.240
Let's settle the problem
in front of us first.

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.040
Forget about going to Shanghai.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.870
Eight.

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:46.870
Nine.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:48.750
Ten.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.690
This is 200.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.000
Thirty-six.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.400
Thirty-seven.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.400
I'd like to make a call.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.360
Okay, go ahead.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.070
Hello, um...

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.720
I'm looking for Yan Xiaodan in Room 303.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.270
Great, thank you.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.680
Hello, Xiaodan.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.720
It's me. What are you doing?

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.020
Waiting for my roommates
to go out together.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.880
Have you eaten?

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.920
Just finished my meal.
You haven't eaten again?

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.630
I've eaten.

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:57.570
I ate at Uncle Ding's place.

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.270
That was really good.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.620
What's wrong? You sound a bit off.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.150
Nothing.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.000
Just hanging around after dinner.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.090
So I'm calling you.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.800
Well, there's something.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.360
We... We...

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.480
We might have
a training session this summer.

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.140
No, it's a training camp.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.000
Yeah, everyone's going.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.350
So I was thinking I should also go

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.480
to learn more

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.270
and hone my skills.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.159
If I join them,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.040
I probably won't be able

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.920
to visit you in Shanghai
during the summer vacation.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.830
Are you hiding something from me?

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:51.210
Nothing.
It's just this summer training session.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:54.510
Then I'm coming back this summer vacation.

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.640
You're coming back?

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.810
Why?

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.590
I miss you.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.630
I want to see you.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.380
That's great!

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.700
That's right. You should come back.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.250
Nowhere is better than home, right?

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:07.850
It'll be so nice to come home.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.630
So when?

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:11.870
I'll go pick you up then.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:12.390
Hmm.

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.600
I've got to hang up.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.800
They're calling me out.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.800
Okay, go have fun.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.740
No problem. Call me if you need anything.

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:19.510
Yeah.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.040
Take it slow.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.500
Over there. Here he comes.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:49.960
He's coming!

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.390
Here, we're here.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.680
Xiaodan! Xia Lei!

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.510
Here, here.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:58.159
Look over here. Here!

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.130
We're here!

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.390
Come on.

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.000
Xiaoman.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.000
-Come on.
-Xiaoman, Xiaoman.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.260
Help me. Give me a hand.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.760
-Give it to me.
-Come on.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.060
Give it to me. Let go.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.260
Let go. You can let go.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.160
Come on, be careful.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.950
Dad.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:14.950
Come on.

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.230
Here.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.330
I missed you.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:19.720
I missed you, too.

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:21.920
You've grown taller again.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:23.730
No, I haven't.

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.800
Alright, you two.
Get in the car and chat there.

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.660
Come on, we're in broad daylight.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.390
Let's go.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.100
Xiaodan, you've grown taller, too!

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.120
Mom, Dad, I'm home.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:45.800
I'm also back, Mrs. Tong.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.720
Welcome back.

00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:48.640
Where is she?

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.159
Over there.

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.750
Come on.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.650
It's so clean and neat.

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:52.800
Come on, Xiaodan.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:54.800
I've changed the bedsheet, duvet cover,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.600
and pillowcase. Everything's new.

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.530
I've also got you

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.690
the towel and toothbrush.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.890
If you need anything else, just tell me.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.000
No need, Mrs. Tong.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.070
I can just stay at my own house.

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.630
That won't do.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.920
Your parents called me

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.460
and said they wanted you
to lodge in my place.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.630
That'll cause you so much trouble.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:11.190
I-I really

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:12.830
can stay at home by myself.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:13.390
What trouble?

00:08:13.390 --> 00:08:14.590
Everything's ready.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:16.160
Your parents entrusted you to me.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.920
Don't make them worry.

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.240
Just stay.

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.160
Making your parents feel assured is
what matters most, right?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.070
Then w-where

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.920
do I sleep?

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.430
On the sofa.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.600
I sleep on the sofa?
That's so uncomfortable. I...

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.190
Y-You can g-go
sleep on the kang at my place.

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:28.790
It's okay.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.000
Mrs. Tong, the two of us are heading out.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:32.750
Let's go.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.080
Where are we going?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.210
Going to your place!

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.240
I got it looking so tidy.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.120
Let's go check it out.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.000
There's a surprise, huh?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.200
No surprise. What surprise would there be?

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.740
You're lying.

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.140
I just cleaned it up a bit.

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:47.640
Come on in.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:51.690
It's so clean now!

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.790
Of course it is.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.360
I came to do cleaning every day.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.960
Good job, clean-up MVP. Let me see.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:07.790
This...

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:10.500
Is this for me?

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:14.750
I love it so much!

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.460
It's amazing.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.030
This is

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:26.720
the platform
where we watched the fireworks, isn't it?

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.850
We stood right here,

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.100
and the fireworks were here.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.840
Right! And then... Let me see.

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.320
And over here.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.790
Right. When we were kids,
we had that fireworks battle

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:39.150
in this corridor.

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:40.870
This...

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:42.630
This is perfectly scaled.

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.270
It's even better than what the seniors

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:45.060
at our school can make.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:45.580
Really?

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.960
We've been playing here
since we were kids.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.480
I know what it looks like,

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:54.600
where every pipe is,

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:56.400
and what's missing accurately.

00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:57.960
It's so well done.

00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.910
What's this?

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:04.850
What's happening?

00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:06.810
It's working time.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:10.950
This...

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.600
This can even smoke?

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.000
Yeah, it has got to work.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.600
Otherwise,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.390
it'd just be a pile of cold metal.

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:19.450
How did you do this?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.800
Do you like it?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:23.960
I do.

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:28.590
You like this?

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.950
This must have taken you
a long time to make.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.520
A few months.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.730
Thank you.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:42.730
For what?

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:50.730
I'm glad you like it.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.840
[Xiaodan]

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:07.630
Come on. Come inside. Welcome back.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.360
We're back.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.580
It's been a while since I was here.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:12.670
It's so good to be back.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:14.270
It feels cozy to be back here.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:16.690
I-I'll light some incense.

00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.600
Haven't seen Mrs. Zhang in a while.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.960
Grandma, Xiaodan is here.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.150
Mrs. Zhang, I'm back.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.750
Why didn't you also tell her
about my return?

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.440
You're right in front of her.
What's there for me to say?

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.900
Mrs. Zhang, I'm back, too.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:26.830
Let me light some incense for you.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:32.400
Why did you put the drawing
I gave you up there?

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.910
I put it there,
so every day when I hit the sack,

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:34.790
I can see it.

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.600
What about the other drawings?

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.750
They're all here.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.200
It's a rotating exhibition.
I don't just display this single one.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.600
I change them on a weekly basis,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.110
sticking a new one every Monday.

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.040
Just put it here.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.080
They're all here. Let me show you.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.070
Look, this one is here.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:53.890
I sealed it with clear tape.

00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:55.150
It won't get dirty.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.620
This one is from last week.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.020
I'll put this one up next week.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:01.860
You're pretty resourceful.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:02.940
Of course.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.390
You still kept the tickets.

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:10.440
What are these? The tickets to Beijing.

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.440
Our tickets when we went to Beijing.

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:19.670
The pilot recruitment poster.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.930
Why are you keeping it?

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.770
Didn't you give it to me?

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:25.670
Besides, you made me this
with good intentions.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:27.480
All my dreams are on it.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:31.580
Zhang Xiaoman,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.080
when we were kids, we played cockfights

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.240
in this Mahavira Hall

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.840
and never settled the score.

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:41.400
Today,
since Xiaodan and Xia Lei are both here,

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:44.130
how about we bury the hatchet over a beer?

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.510
Watch me teach him a lesson today.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:46.510
-Come on!
- If I don't put him in his place,

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:47.270
he'll never stop.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.720
-Come on, let's do it.
-Don't go easy on him.

00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.910
Come on, what do you want?

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:51.010
Xiaoman, beat him in arm wrestling!

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:51.320
Go.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.010
Get him.

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.070
Ready.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.470
Start!

00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:59.080
Nice, Xiaoman!

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.830
Xiaoman!

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.440
Go harder!

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.720
Get down!

00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:09.380
This round doesn't count!

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:09.960
Best two out of three.

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.960
Always refusing to accept defeat.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.420
Go another round with him?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.850
I bet you don't dare.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:18.870
-Alright. Ready?
-One, two, three, go!

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:23.570
What are you photographing?

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.490
What are you taking pics of?

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.450
I'm taking photos of our plant.

00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:33.690
When I was in Shanghai,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.320
my dad told me stories
about building the plant.

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.150
He said back then,
there were people from everywhere.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:42.750
Everyone spoke their hometown dialects

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.880
in different tones,

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.390
yet with the same cadence.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:48.720
I found it so amazing,

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.150
just like building that Tower of Babel

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:52.610
in the Western mythology.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.290
Well, when we were kids,

00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.690
all we did was mess around here.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:01.810
We had no idea
how many stories were hidden inside here.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.790
I just want to record them all properly.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.290
Take him down directly!

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.190
Go for it!

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.480
Come on!

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.320
Come on, say you admit defeat.

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.070
Good job, Xiaoman!

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:15.470
Do you admit your defeat?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.850
-Oh, no.
-You were cheating.

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:19.380
Come on.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.880
He's getting worked up again. Gosh.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.390
Look at you.

00:14:23.390 --> 00:14:24.510
He said he wanted to bury the hatchet.

00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.300
But you insisted on competing with him.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.160
Baldy Song rarely gets
to hang out with us.

00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160
We had to compete.

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.100
If it weren't for the holiday,
we wouldn't see them.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.150
Just like when we were kids.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.320
-Yeah.
-What are you looking at?

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:35.040
I remember when we were kids,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.300
these chimneys were smoking all the time.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.090
Now,

00:14:38.510 --> 00:14:40.670
we finally see them without smoke.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.170
That tower, the one on the left.

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:44.320
That's...

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.730
The branch plant, yeah,
the smelting branch plant.

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:48.790
From left to right,

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.600
two smelting, one coking.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.770
Then Workshop 1 and Workshop 2 are
lined up behind in order.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.480
You know, back in school,

00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.550
Xiaoman couldn't beat me
in reciting textbooks.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.510
But when it came to remembering this,
he nailed it every time.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.150
You know what?

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.120
I clearly remember when each chimney

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.120
stopped smoking.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.450
You even remember that?

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:12.810
First, this one,
the smelting plant's chimney.

00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.110
It stopped smoking
around our sophomore year.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:19.030
Then the coking plant's chimney followed.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.110
Next, Workshop 1 and Workshop 2

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.580
shut down one by one.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:34.740
Xiaoman!

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.140
Xiaoman!

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.950
Xiaoman, are you still there?

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:39.950
I saw them!

00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:42.000
Xiaoman!

00:15:43.510 --> 00:15:44.320
Xiaoman!

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.620
Why did you stop
setting off fireworks earlier?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.440
I thought you had left.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.840
Were you waiting for me?

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.480
No, I wasn't waiting for you.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.150
Then what were you waiting for?

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:22.680
Waiting for the right time.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.080
What time?

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.220
Do you forget what day it is today?

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:29.440
Look.

00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:31.550
It's Friday now,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.240
Time for me to set off fireworks for you.

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:36.720
Friday!

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.360
I thought I'd never see them again.

00:16:45.830 --> 00:16:47.690
Why are you making it sound so sad?

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:50.570
Look, this Mahavira Hall is

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.720
right here.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.080
And I am

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.650
right here, too.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.420
Come back anytime if you want to see it
or see me. Everything's still here.

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:27.920
Why did you bring all that stuff?

00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.920
There's no room left.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.160
That is corn flour.

00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.350
And these are...

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:32.920
-Honey fungi.
-Heimuer fungi.

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:34.110
Oh, yeah, t-those are honey fungi.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:35.510
These are heimuer fungi.

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.510
It's hard to fit everything in.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.860
With your dad here,
nothing's impossible to fit in.

00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:39.720
How can we pack more?

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.510
-Put it in here.
-Right.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:41.960
No, no, put the clothes...
Put the clothes here.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:43.260
We don't eat these things in the dorm.

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:44.480
We can't cook there.

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.960
They're not for you.
They're for Chief Engineer Yan.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:46.680
A taste of home.

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.340
-You know nothing.
-Exactly.

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:49.420
Why should I give them to him?

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.480
So inconsiderate.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:53.550
You're preparing so much stuff.
It's hard to carry.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.400
This is so heavy.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.510
It's not heavy. Not at all.

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:57.110
I can fit much more in for you.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.160
They're for you!

00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.510
And you're whining about the weight?

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.170
What else? Should I pack more?

00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:02.960
Should I pack some fruit for you?

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.350
-Take some fruit then.
-Fruit? Seriously?

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.070
-You can eat some on your way,
-It'll all spoil during the journey.

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.830
Coming.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.830
I'm back.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:10.510
Welcome back, Xiaoman.

00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:11.510
-How's the packing?
-Finally, you're here.

00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:12.510
We're almost done packing.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:13.240
Good.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.110
What took you so long?

00:18:14.110 --> 00:18:15.670
I've been waiting for you for ages.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:17.280
Are you upset?
I went to buy you some food.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.680
Hurry and eat this popsicle. It's melting.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:23.550
I don't want to leave.

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:25.480
Let me pack your things.

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.410
It's still early. Let's wait a bit.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:29.110
It's not like you won't come back, right?

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:30.040
Xia Lei, Xia Lei.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.920
Xia Lei!

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.350
Xiaodan doesn't want to leave.

00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:38.550
Be more considerate.

00:18:39.070 --> 00:18:40.330
J-Just sit here for a while.

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:41.330
Your mom is right.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.260
Move in a bit.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:43.480
Let me sit on the sofa.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.060
The 8-treasure porridge
goes in the suitcase.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:48.300
Six bottles of AD calcium milk go here.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.700
I don't want to go.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.910
I don't want to leave you.

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:54.860
Don't you have to go back to school?

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:56.190
You don't want to leave.

00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:57.690
But you can't stay either.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.070
But school takes so long.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.860
Look, you go back now,
and then autumn passes.

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:07.550
By the time you're in your padded jacket,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.760
you'll be back for the New Year.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:09.390
Right?

00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:13.640
That will still take a long, long time.

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:18.160
Oh, right.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:20.110
Could you send
the Mahavira Hall model from my place

00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:21.350
to Shanghai?

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.510
It can keep me company.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.910
The Mahavira Hall model?

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:25.460
Okay. You go first.

00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:27.510
And I'll find a way to deliver it to you.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:28.750
Hurry up and finish packing.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:29.850
Then we need to catch the bus.

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:30.800
Otherwise, we'll be late.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:32.730
Alright, don't cry anymore, okay?

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:34.650
Hurry up and pack the food.

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:38.820
I'll put the fan in your bag,

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:41.350
so you can use it anytime
when you feel hot on the train.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:42.880
I'm putting it here for you.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:47.300
Let's go. We're running out of time.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:47.910
Xia Lei!

00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:51.260
-Come on, get up.
-Let's go.

00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.960
Let's go. Come on. Get up now.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.700
Let's move.

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.680
Let's go.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:19:55.290
Go.

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:56.720
I'll carry it.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:57.480
No, no.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.960
Let your dad carry it. Hurry up.

00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.490
Let's go.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:02.720
Xia Lei, help us carry these.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.960
If you were the one who pacified her,

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.960
we would miss the bus.

00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:06.290
S-Stop, don't pinch me.

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:14.750
Yan,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.290
this is that reaction tower, right?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.900
It's so exquisite.

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.350
How is it so well-made?

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:21.160
What do you think, Dad?

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:22.590
It's a gift from Xiaoman.

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.840
This is much better
than that lame little boat

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.350
he gave you before.

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:29.700
This model is

00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:33.110
truly amazing at this level of detail.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:36.510
Xiaoman's welding proportions are precise.

00:20:36.910 --> 00:20:38.110
Back in our day,

00:20:38.430 --> 00:20:39.960
only senior welders

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:41.430
could pull this off.

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.550
When Xiaoman graduates,

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.160
he'll definitely become
a senior welder, too.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.160
Yan, look, look at this.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.900
You used to go up and down these stairs

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:52.050
every day for work.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.460
Sweetie, look.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.440
It's so well-made.

00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:57.190
By the way, Dad, look.

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:58.910
We can even turn the light on.

00:20:58.910 --> 00:20:59.350
Here.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:00.350
Look.

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:01.750
It can even make smoke.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.550
-Great.
-It looks exactly like the real thing.

00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:04.280
Look at this.

00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:07.960
I must say, Xiaoman is incredibly skilled.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.560
He's such a great craftsman!

00:21:13.450 --> 00:21:14.050
Lei.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:15.910
Lei!

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.720
You freaked me out!

00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.640
You scared me!

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:29.140
You...

00:21:29.170 --> 00:21:29.960
What are you doing?

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:31.590
Don't you know
you can literally scare someone to death?

00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:32.110
I know!

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:33.590
Yet you still scared me!

00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:37.110
I saw you had your earphones on,
and I called you so many times.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.110
W-What the heck.

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:40.380
I paid you the mortgage.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:41.570
Don't follow me around every day

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:42.510
like a loan shark.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.440
What do you want?

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.030
Did I urge you to pay back?

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:46.070
Did I?

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.350
I'm doing a customer follow-up

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.030
to check if your computer works well.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:51.030
Does it work well?

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.790
Yeah.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.410
I'm using it to watch movies
and learn English.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.510
In this English-speaking environment,

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:01.510
my English is improving like crazy.

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:02.630
Right?

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:05.910
But you could just use a tape recorder
to learn English.

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:08.040
Isn't using a computer a bit overkill?

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.880
I also wrote some programs.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Got to make full use of it, you know?

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:13.840
No, no, no.

00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:15.350
Do you remember

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.900
when I first took you to the computer mall

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:17.920
and let you feel

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.350
the touch of the future?

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:20.510
Yes, I remember it.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.300
BBS has helped me a lot.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.880
So, have you ever considered

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.510
creating your own BBS

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:26.870
to help others?

00:22:31.450 --> 00:22:34.050
I actually tried writing some programs,

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:36.920
planning to put them

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.590
on our school's website,

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.600
so our fellows

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.750
can have a platform to communicate.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.530
But what I made is too simple.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:46.960
It's still far from ready.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.110
Not at all! I think your idea is great!

00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.900
You must keep at it.

00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:51.100
This is a golden idea.

00:22:51.450 --> 00:22:52.140
C language.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:53.750
C++.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:56.470
Network theory and technology.

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:57.800
Study them thoroughly.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.130
What do you mean?

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:02.750
You have weapons but no ammunition.
This won't do!

00:23:02.750 --> 00:23:03.880
You need materials.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.280
These are all the latest versions.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.110
I'm back.

00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:08.350
How was it?

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:11.110
Was the class reunion fun?

00:23:11.510 --> 00:23:12.840
Not interesting at all.

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.880
Not interesting?

00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:17.400
Did you drink then?

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:19.480
Of course I did. How could I not?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.200
What did you drink?

00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:22.060
Baijiu.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.520
Don't we Shanghai people
usually drink huangjiu?

00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.010
In their eyes, I'm now just

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.350
a guy from the East Chemical Plant
in the Northeast.

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:32.950
Fine then.
We'd just follow Northeast customs

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.090
and have Baijiu.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:35.940
So what did you all talk about?

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.300
Don't even get me started.

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.460
I thought that at the class reunion,

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.350
everyone would talk about the past.

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:42.000
-Yeah!
-Right?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:42.900
All those fun times

00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:43.830
and fun stories.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:46.670
No. Nobody mentioned any of them.

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:49.840
These people were all putting on airs,

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.160
talking about things

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:54.860
like how BNP Paribas set up in Pudong.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.380
They were chatting away excitedly.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.240
I mean, first of all,

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.880
what does that have to do
with any of them?

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.680
We don't even use French francs.

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:02.590
Ridiculous.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.350
Alright, calm down.

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.350
Have some water.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.750
It's nothing.

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:07.000
I'm not angry.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.200
It's really nothing.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.680
I'm not going to these gatherings anymore.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:12.480
How boring.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.110
I still miss

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:18.970
those old colleagues of mine
from the East Chemical Plant.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.930
We had so much fun chatting together.

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:23.810
These people...

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:26.350
Oh, this shop restocked.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:28.350
T-They're also selling
presbyopic glasses now?

00:24:28.350 --> 00:24:30.110
Selling instant noodles
and presbyopic glasses together?

00:24:30.110 --> 00:24:31.000
Why do you care?

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.510
How much is this meat?

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:36.950
Mr. Ding!

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.290
Give me some pork belly.

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:40.550
Which piece do you want?

00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.080
This one?

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.350
Look how good this is. It has 3 layers.

00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:46.270
Look how fresh it is.

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:47.600
Well, I w-want this one.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.590
What? Just this little bit?

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:50.920
Mr. Ding,

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.640
is this enough?

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:55.040
I think your standard of living has

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.960
dropped a bit lately.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:57.350
Stop your blabbering
about my standard of living.

00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:59.830
When has mine ever declined?

00:25:00.510 --> 00:25:02.030
There's no one else
dining at my home anymore.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.850
If I keep eating like this,

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:04.830
just listening to Xia's wife will spike
my blood pressure, sugar, and lipid.

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:06.000
Can I be superior to others?

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.290
There are still
the Plant Secretary and Director!

00:25:08.290 --> 00:25:08.700
That's right.

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:09.550
It's for Xiaoman.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:10.910
Xiaoman is still growing.

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:11.930
J-Just this little bit?

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.130
It is a bit too little.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:15.550
Here, here. This one.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:16.960
This one's good.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.240
T-This one's fattier.

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:20.310
It's for the kid, for growing.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:21.050
It's 7.3 yuan.

00:25:21.050 --> 00:25:21.850
Just give me 7.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:23.350
Just let me pay the exact cost.

00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:24.400
Give me 7. Just 7.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:25.780
Pay me 7.

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.620
-Alright, then.
-Liu, I'm heading back.

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.280
7 yuan, huh?

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.270
What's this for?

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:34.820
I'm giving you this pork skin for free.

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:36.280
Go home and make some aspic

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:37.200
for salad.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.750
Consider it an extra dish
for Xiaoman from me.

00:25:39.750 --> 00:25:40.400
Take it.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:41.050
Thank you.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:41.590
It's okay.

00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:42.400
Mr. Ding.

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.420
Are you leaving? Take care.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:46.380
I got another piece of pork skin
from your shop.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:47.320
T-Take it easy.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.110
Alright.

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:49.880
See you.

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:51.160
Bye.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.440
Awesome, Xia Lei.

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:54.430
You're a big shot at school now.

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:57.750
This is just the preliminary version.

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.450
It still needs some debugging.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.290
Why so modest?

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.210
The school computer lab is packed now.

00:26:02.210 --> 00:26:04.000
Everyone's flocking into it to post.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.110
That's right.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:07.470
Who's got a dorm as awesome as ours now?

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.320
Look,

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.720
we've got a computer and internet.

00:26:10.790 --> 00:26:13.160
Most importantly, we've got the Great Lei.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.750
I want to post a friend-making message.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.740
The one I posted yesterday
got no response all day.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.170
It got buried in just one afternoon.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:19.350
Today, I changed to a new pen name.

00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:21.350
It's called "Memories in the Wind."

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:22.960
Your name has too many memories.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.170
No wonder no one's responded.

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:25.830
How about the name "Awesome"?

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.270
-Senior Fan.
-Senior Fan.

00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:28.960
What brings you here?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:29.810
Just came to see you.

00:26:29.810 --> 00:26:31.170
Wait, wait. Get in line.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:33.480
I'm the second shareholder. I go first.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.520
Then I'm third.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.010
Feeling a little sense of accomplishment?

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.680
First, help me check what's up
with this mountain bike.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.090
Seeing them so excited,

00:26:40.550 --> 00:26:42.670
I'm actually feeling a bit overconfident.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:44.400
Do you want to feel even better?

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:45.890
What do you mean?

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.950
I want to take the website beyond campus

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:50.300
and into the world.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:51.750
Are you running a fever?

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:52.480
Nope.

00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:54.110
I want to build a new website,

00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:55.840
fuel it with commercial value,

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:56.920
and sell it to the world.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:57.640
What do you think?

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.160
I think you're even more overconfident
than I am now.

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:00.960
Not at all!

00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:03.060
W-Will anyone actually buy it?

00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:04.190
Of course they will!

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:09.240
Let me guess what you're thinking.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:11.440
You want me to start a business with you.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:12.870
You guessed right.

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:14.000
I believe

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:17.280
the internet will change every aspect
of our future.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.450
We're now standing at the threshold
between the past and the future.

00:27:20.450 --> 00:27:22.900
Lei, whether we're stepping across it

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:25.120
depends on your answer.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.480
Here we are.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:37.720
This place?

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.690
It's a bit rundown,
but it looks promising.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.720
What do you think?

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:45.560
This is where we'll work.

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.240
The whole building?

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.500
Just one of the rooms.

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.910
What's wrong?

00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:54.990
Are you crazy?

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:56.130
We'll light it up!

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.460
Let's go upstairs.

00:27:57.770 --> 00:27:58.550
I'll show you

00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.380
where we'll make our dreams come true.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.060
Slow down.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.700
I'm getting excited.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.940
I'm way too excited.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:09.710
So? Pretty hyped, right?

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.740
Which floor is it on?

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.480
Seventh floor.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:12.340
Seventh floor?

00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:14.510
777.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.420
What do you think?

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:18.440
I specifically chose this number.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.270
Please.

00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:28.510
How is it?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:29.820
Isn't it great?

00:28:30.060 --> 00:28:31.720
Don't you think it's so great?

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:33.510
We're already doing pretty well.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:36.350
Many companies
first start their businesses

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:37.750
in garages or basements.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:40.310
We're already up here on the 7th floor.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:41.510
Look at this slogan.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:42.460
I chose it specifically.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.910
"Make big plans; build strong foundations;
win the future."

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:47.110
What do you think?

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.790
Not bad.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:49.590
Small as it may be,

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.210
it has everything we need.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:54.590
The key is that the internet is fast.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.640
How fast?

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:56.680
One megabyte.

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.750
1024 kilobytes.

00:28:59.510 --> 00:29:00.170
How's that?

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:02.690
You've spent so much on r-rent

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:04.570
yet still got such fast internet?

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:06.100
Don't worry about the money.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:07.160
That's my concern.

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:08.300
[Business License
for the corporate entity]

00:29:08.300 --> 00:29:10.300
Registered capital, 100,000 yuan?

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.680
Registration doesn't need that much.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:18.010
Why are you leaving?

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.640
So what do you think?

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.090
I just feel like we haven't
done anything yet,

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.220
and we already invested so much money.

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.050
I'm feeling the pressure already.

00:29:29.050 --> 00:29:30.140
Pressure is good.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.280
Pressure begets motivation.

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.460
How about you drop out of school?

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.550
Focus completely on our startup.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.270
I heard that Microsoft's Bill Gates

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.180
dropped out of school

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:42.980
and got rich working in a garage.

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.960
Our starting point is higher than others.

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.960
All we need now is a college dropout.

00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.690
I have many classes at school,

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.750
and I'm already short on time.

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.090
Let me set up the computer first.

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:56.630
I told you to drop out.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:58.760
Dear teachers and students,

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.550
in order to inspire
our students' innovative thinking

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:03.010
and practical abilities,

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:05.110
the School
of Architecture and Urban Planning,

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.510
together with the Academic Affairs Office
and Student Affairs Office,

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.960
officially launches

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.110
the 3rd Tongzhou Cup
Architectural Design Competition.

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:12.590
The competition will be themed

00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:14.510
on the Harmony of Tradition and Modernity,

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:16.750
exploring innovative design solutions

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.350
with cultural heritage significance.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.410
All students are encouraged
to participate actively.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:25.310
Come on, students in the back, keep up!

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:25.830
Okay.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:28.350
So this is that corridor?

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.210
That corridor.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:31.510
This seems to be where the molten steel

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.510
gets discharged.

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:34.480
It flows down along this channel.

00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.140
Right, it goes down from here.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.540
There are photos here.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.510
We'll be striving hard here for life!

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.240
This plant might not
even be able to outlast you.

00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.500
"For life"? How silly.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.230
Don't jinx it.

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.070
Xiaoman.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.960
Starting today,

00:30:54.270 --> 00:30:55.800
we're officially workers.

00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:57.190
Do you feel excited?

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:58.750
What's there to be excited about?

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:00.280
Isn't this how it should be?

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:01.510
Students.

00:31:02.750 --> 00:31:04.160
How was the tour?

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.160
Very good.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.440
Then I'll share with you all

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.510
our yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:12.250
Yesterday, there were
technical school classes.

00:31:12.250 --> 00:31:14.350
Today, we're having a tour
of the plant history exhibition.

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:16.750
Tomorrow, we'll be assigned to workshops.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:19.450
Guys,

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:20.990
does anyone know

00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.550
why our plant is called
the Third Front Plant?

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:26.110
Isn't it just because it's
a military plant far from urban areas?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.060

00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:31.350
not entirely accurate.

So beautiful. You look just like her.

Yes.

-Who took it?
-Your grandpa?

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.760
That's right! It was my grandpa!

00:31:59.110 --> 00:32:00.170

My grandma didn't tell me
where she is in the photo.

I can't work at the plant anymore.

The Plant Director
has been so good to our family.

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.510
So I'm just sewing some small cloth pads

Look at this.

It definitely is.

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:41.880
Did you find your grandfather?

Was this missile produced by our plant?

00:32:59.510 --> 00:33:01.110
This was an artillery shell.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:04.110
Our plant produced the gunpowder
inside the shells.

00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:05.110

these veteran First Front Plants.

They provided technical support.

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:19.350
And there were also college students
from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai.

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:21.160
They traveled thousands of miles

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.870
to dedicate their youth here.

your grandparents might be
in these photos.

Let's go down and take a look.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.260
The Third Front was

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.200
a military preparedness concept.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.240
In the late 1960s,

00:33:40.050 --> 00:33:41.110
to prepare for war,

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:43.790
many important plants

Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan,
and other inland regions.

These plants

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.960

why isn't our plant marked on it?

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:08.510
Our plant was

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.170
a military enterprise

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.280
and also part of the Third Front system.

00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:15.270
Military plants

00:34:15.270 --> 00:34:17.770
must follow principles
of mountain proximity and concealment,

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.900
with dispersed locations
and underground facilities.

00:34:21.590 --> 00:34:24.590
That was why we established it
in this mountain valley

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:27.580
and how our East Chemical Plant
came into being.

00:34:27.590 --> 00:34:29.650
Since we were a classified facility,

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.000
we wouldn't be marked on maps.

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:34.520
Because we were a classified facility,

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.600
we got this confidentiality manual.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:37.920

why is there less work in our plant now?

hope.

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:25.650

of the giant and drew my inspiration

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.480
to reach higher hopes.

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.550
She really didn't plagiarize.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:43.280
Do you know what this is called?

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:44.090
Elevation.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.530
The concept is different.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:46.940
Right.

00:38:46.970 --> 00:38:47.700
Oh, by the way,

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:50.360
my professor recommended me
for a study abroad program.

00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.070
Where to?

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:51.880
France.

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:56.320
That's great!
Haven't you always wanted to go abroad?

00:38:56.500 --> 00:38:59.150
You've always wanted
to be like Magellan, right?

00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.920
You must go.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:00.550
You must go.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.360
Yan, we should support our daughter.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.360
It's still up in the air.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.500
I still need to prepare
quite a lot of materials.

00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:06.430
You must go.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.550
Yeah, you definitely should go.

00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:09.440
You must seize this opportunity.

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:10.910
Listen, Xiaodan.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.140
I really want you

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.730
to see a broader world.

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:18.550
I know.

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.160
First, take a good look at my certificate.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:20.920
It's quite an achievement.

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.550
My first-ever award certificate. Come on.

00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:23.190
Okay.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:24.180
Check it out.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:26.960
Yan Xiaodan,

00:39:27.150 --> 00:39:28.670
your design

00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:31.080
won first place

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:34.550
in the 2000 Tongzhou Cup
Architectural Design Competition.

00:39:35.480 --> 00:39:36.540
Congratulations.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.320
Come on, make way.

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.550
Make way.

00:40:03.550 --> 00:40:04.230
Come on.

00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:10.360
Why isn't the gate open?

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.110
We got here too early.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:12.800
Bro!

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.880
Time for work!

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:15.730
There they come!

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.000
Don't be anxious. We're coming.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.520
Coming.

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.510
Alright!

00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:22.880
Let's go.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.230
Be careful.

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:33.960
[East Integrated Chemical Plant]

00:40:33.960 --> 00:40:34.590
Morning!

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:35.260
Morning!

00:40:37.510 --> 00:40:38.760
Wow, that job was

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.490
-a mess.
-Don't push yourself.

00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.760
Sirs, come in quickly.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.110
These are all your apprentices.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:46.800
Take them with you.

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.190
Okay.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.320
Who's Gao Dewei?

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:48.760
Me.

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:49.760
Come on, follow me.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:50.220
It's me.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.960
Let's go.

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:51.560
Take care.

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:52.630
Which one is Wang Xin?

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:53.030
Here.

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.760
Come with me.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:54.630
Wang Dongdong!

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:55.320
Who's Wang Dongdong?

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.070
It's me, me.

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:57.150
-Hello, Master.
-Follow me!

00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.960
I'll be training you from now on.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.020
Call me Master Tan.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.410
You look so energetic, young man.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:03.360
From now on, you and I

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:04.490
will be like family.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:04.950
Nice.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.180
Where's my master?

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:08.520
Not here yet.

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:09.280
Hang on a bit.

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:10.470
Sit here and wait.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:17.700
-Here he is.
-Mr. Ding.

00:41:18.110 --> 00:41:18.760
Get out.

00:41:25.710 --> 00:41:26.640
What's going on?

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:33.980
Why did you stop my medication?

00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:35.880
Back then, when the plant

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.960
commended me for my heroic act,

00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.960
the Director said I could get

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.820
testosterone whenever I needed.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.020
The Director has said a lot of things.

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:44.810
The plant hasn't been doing well lately.

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:47.160
So we've cut some non-essential meds

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:48.330
for the time being.

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.950
How is it non-essential?

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.480
Why is it non-essential?

00:41:53.590 --> 00:41:54.960
Testosterone is
absolutely essential for me.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.750
Don't you understand?

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:57.410
What's so essential about it?

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:58.730
Mr. Ding,

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.910
you've been taking it for years,

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:03.200
and I haven't seen any results.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:06.090
Maybe you've developed a resistance?

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.640
I'm not leaving
until you sort this out today.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.190
How about this?

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:15.360
You pay for it yourself.

00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:16.730
If you agree to pay for it yourself,

00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:17.320
I can...

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.860
Why should I pay for it myself?

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:19.790
On what grounds?

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:21.840
Why should I?

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:23.150
Why are you yelling at me?

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.510
Here.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:24.590
Take a look at this.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:27.920
This is our plant's list of medications

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.740
for those regular patients
and common illnesses.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.550
If you think your testosterone

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:33.960
matters more than blood pressure pills,

00:42:33.960 --> 00:42:35.550
diabetes meds, painkillers,

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:36.480
and such,

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:38.760
then go ahead and cross something off.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.960
Cross it out. It's fine.

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.490
I'll explain and handle it.

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:43.550
You know,

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:44.920
maybe I can't handle you, Mr. Ding,

00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.380
but I certainly can
deal with those elderly and sick patients.

00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.940
Mr. Ding.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.480
Let's go.
