[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.030
[Episode 28]

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.030
I—your new Emperor—am standing here
before you.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.160
Why do you not kneel?

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.190
Kneel!

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.520
Long live Your Majesty!

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.110
Who is there?

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.870
Who?

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.100
I am the Emperor.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.680
Who dares to laugh at me?

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.390
You're nothing but a lowborn bastard—

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.400
the child of a lowly maid.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.750
And you think you're worthy of
calling me Mother?

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.610
You're only fit

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.390
to be trampled underfoot by Xiahou Dan!

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.400
Beat him.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.950
Beat him hard!

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.840
Bo!

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:00.360
Bo!

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.590
Bo!

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.360
Bo!

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.150
Bo.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:04.630
My poor Bo.

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.080
Are you alright?

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.460
The child is innocent.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.630
I beg you, please let Bo go.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.280
It's my fault.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.780
It's all my fault.

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.050
Let him know

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.070
who truly calls the shots

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.339
in Great Xia!

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.620
No!

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.430
Weren't you asking to be beaten?

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.560
Don't hit her!

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.590
Mother!

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.000
Mother!

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.270
Mother!

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.550
[Peiyang]

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.970
You.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.190
Those men are wearing
the border army's armor.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.720
It seems

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.040
they've taken full control of
Peiyang City.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.510
Show yours.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:45.480
But if they've occupied the city,

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.950
-You may go.
-why would they reopen the gates

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.360
and allow the common people come and go?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.830
His Majesty said in his letter

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.090
that he left reinforcements in Peiyang.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.480
We must enter the city at once...

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.210
Turn around.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.159
And find them.

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:57.830
Only then will we have a chance
to rescue His Majesty.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.830
But the border army has
tens of thousands of troops.

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.670
If we enter now and get exposed,

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.750
there will truly be no escape for us.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.120
-Nothing ventured,
-You, come here.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.050
nothing gained.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.100
This is our only option right now.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.040
It seems these guards...

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.480
You may enter.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.800
Are only checking luggage.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.130
Go on.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.680
They don't seem to be looking for anyone.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.310
Your Highness,

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:17.370
it's still unwise.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.480
Did His Majesty leave any token?

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.120
How about letting us enter the city
to search first?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.780
We'll come back to fetch Your Highness
once the news is confirmed.

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:26.190
Token...

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.140
Yours.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.410
Move along.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.720
Thank you for bringing us all the way
to Peiyang.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.920
I've had them prepare some travel expenses
for you.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.780
Your Highness.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.120
There's no need for you
to follow us any further.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.650
Find a place to settle down.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.130
Let's go.

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.310
There's no reason for you guys
to risk your lives for me.

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.040
Let's enter the city together.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.360
[Peiyang]

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.690
Go on.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:05.660
You may enter.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.190
Let's go.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.770
Go ahead.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:10.490
You. Come here.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.680
-Stop.
-What's inside?

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.140
Hold on.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.930
Come here.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.480
Officer.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.000
-We're here for medical treatment.
-Go on in.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.040
Take out your things for inspection.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.410
Follow me, all of you.

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.390
[Prefect's Mansion]

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.950
[Prefect's Mansion]

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.130
General Lin, they're here.

00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.120
Wanyin.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:07:59.360
Bai?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.100
Smells so good!

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.800
Put out another set of tableware,
will you?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.680
Don't be stingy.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.510
You are the Emperor now.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.370
What's one more set of tableware?

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.510
Last night when I observed the stars,

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:14.680
I noticed that the five stars
were about to align.

00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.250
So?

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.750
Don't take this lightly.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:18.360
Master's divinations are always accurate,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:20.720
and he asked me to pass along
one more thing:

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.190
your meeting with each other

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.920
may not be a blessing after all.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.410
It's me.

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.640
Come in, please.

00:08:38.179 --> 00:08:39.390
Moving around the camp,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.789
men's clothing is indeed more convenient.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.909
Here's the freshly brewed medicine.

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:45.110
It's cooled down now.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.360
Thank you, General Lin.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:08:59.720
Actually,

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.980
I still prefer you call me Bai.

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.830
So who are you really, Bai

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:06.440
or Lin Xuanying?

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.030
I'm Lin Xuanying.

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:15.030
I originally thought
you killed Lin Xuanying

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.630
and were impersonating him.

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.090
But after thinking it through,

00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:21.530
even though you've grown a beard,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.470
how could there be two people

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.800
who look exactly the same in this world?

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.350
I was born with a lock of white hair.

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.240
Bai

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.090
is the nickname Master gave me.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:34.000
But you had just finished
your apprenticeship.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.360
How did you become
a Deputy General so quickly?

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.960
Well...

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.000
Because you hadn't just finished
your apprenticeship.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:51.870
Our first meeting

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.080
wasn't actually your first meeting
with His Majesty, was it?

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.750
How long have you two known each other?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:59.280
This involves some secrets

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:02.630
I can't speak of.

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:07.100
If you are referring to

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.470
His Majesty's past from another world,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.910
he wrote me a letter

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:17.400
and told me everything.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.480
He tried every way to keep it from you

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:26.870
because he was worried
it would scare you away.

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:27.520
Years ago,

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.670
my master, the Nameless,
cast a heavenly divination

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.730
and predicted that

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.500
the arrival of a child from another world

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.330
would change the state's fate.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.120
He had intended to personally
step in to assist,

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.250
but that divination

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.530
revealed the workings of heaven

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.700
and severely drained his energy.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.970
He could only stay home to recuperate,

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.510
so he sent me out after graduating
to find His Majesty.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.460
But after I arrived at the palace,

00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:54.720
His Majesty said

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.390
he had another purpose for me to serve.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:10:59.190
I've secretly trained a group of

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.700
secret guards loyal to me.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.840
There's not much point in you
staying by my side to protect me.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.170
What do you need me to do?

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.650
Without military power,
I have no trump card.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.840
No matter how I maneuver,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.290
I can't overthrow
my enemies in the court.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:18.790
So,

00:11:21.790 --> 00:11:24.050
have you thought about joining the army?

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.810
After that, I infiltrated the Right Army.

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:28.410
Indeed.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.000
The Right Army

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:34.230
is the furthest from
Prince Duan's influence.

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.120
Your small maneuvers in there

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.690
would be hard to detect.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.720
It was also thanks to the fact that

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.690
General You

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.840
is a fool.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.910
As the commander of the Right Army,

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:46.510
General You doesn't have a shred of
a true general's bearing.

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.320
I don't expect him
to accomplish anything significant.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.720
But with him in that post,

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.400
I can't command him,

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:52.920
nor can Prince Duan.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.750
His Majesty and I worked,
one in the open and one in the shadows,

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:57.570
so we could undermine him
right under the noses

00:11:57.570 --> 00:11:58.700
of all the factions.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.210
Now, the Right Army

00:12:00.950 --> 00:12:02.610
basically follows my orders.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:05.650
Your Highness.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.620
You can trust me.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:09.250
I gave you that hairpin

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.800
for you to wear in your hair,

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:15.190
not to hold in your hand

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:18.610
as a weapon for self-defense.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:28.230
I'm sorry,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.110
Bai.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:31.650
So much has happened along the way,

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.150
and meeting you in Peiyang

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:35.150
was just too easy,

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.670
so I couldn't help but be suspicious.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.470
I understand.

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:39.750
That's why, starting from Peiyang,

00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.010
I've had my trusted men

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.720
take shifts at the city gates
day and night,

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.120
patrolling constantly.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.600
I was worried
you might disguise yourself,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.130
so I specifically told them

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.720
to look out for a skylark-shaped hairpin.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.630
Thank you,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:52.600
Bai.

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:08.030
Drag him

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.540
away.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.390
Your Highness, please spare my life!

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.190
Your Highness, please spare me!

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:15.790
Your Highness, please spare me!

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.600
Your Highness!

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.800
Please spare my life!

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:27.200
Imperial Physician Zhang,

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.790
how is

00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:32.150
my leg?

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:38.390
Your Highness is blessed with
extraordinary fortune.

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.130
Given time,

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:40.550
it'll surely heal...

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:41.800
I want the truth!

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.640
We will do our utmost to treat it.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.980
-We will do our best.
-We will do our best.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.060
Your Highness,

00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:50.520
the wound on your leg

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:52.130
is highly prone to causing

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.030
sepsis.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.950
Amputation is needed immediately

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.200
to save your life.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.150
Very well.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.180
None of you could tell!

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.270
Guards.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.480
Except for him,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.330
drag the rest away.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.320
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness! Your Highness!

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.440
-Your Highness, please wait.
-Your Highness!

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.300
-Your Highness!
-Your Highness.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.720
Your Highness,

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.120
they simply didn't dare
tell you the truth.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.160
A bunch of useless trash.

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:30.830
Get lost.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.090
-Thank you, Your Highness.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.150
-Thank you, Your Highness.
-Thank you, Your Highness.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.080
What is

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.670
your name?

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.030
I am

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.880
Xiao Tiancai.

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:55.450
Your Highness,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.550
he is that Physician Xiao

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.210
who has been
keeping the Empress Dowager alive.

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:07.960
You said you could treat my leg.

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.790
As I said,

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:13.010
amputation is the only way

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.790
to save your life.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:17.510
Are you absolutely certain?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.050
Even the greatest doctor alive

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.720
wouldn't dare guarantee
absolute certainty.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.780
But as a physician,

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.360
I'll surely give it my utmost effort

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:28.530
to heal the sick

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:29.410
and save lives.

00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.240
Alright.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.800
You may leave for now.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.670
I'll think about it.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.960
In fact, as early as
the beginning of last year,

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.760
we were already fully prepared.

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:48.480
We planned

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.150
to purge the entire Right Army

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.350
and then declare war.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.450
Although victory wasn't guaranteed,

00:15:54.910 --> 00:15:57.390
by striking unexpectedly
and catching them off guard,

00:15:57.390 --> 00:15:58.250
even if we died,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.460
we could take the Empress Dowager
and Prince Duan down with us.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.270
Those were His Majesty's exact words.

00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:06.150
But just then,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:08.950
you appeared.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.910
What's the point of laying out
such a grand scheme

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.460
and taking so many detours?

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:18.040
If we weren't going to attack directly,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.750
why send me to the Right Army
in the first place?

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.750
Careful planning

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.670
is to minimize casualties.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.320
But the situation is changing rapidly.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.790
If we keep dragging this out,

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.520
even our last chance of victory
might evaporate.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.200
I just don't understand—

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.000
why should you listen to a woman?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.130
Because in her eyes,

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:39.200
whether it's peddlers and porters

00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.920
or commoners and peasants—

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.270
every single life

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:44.870
is precious.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.930
So that day,

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.910
in the woods, you...

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:50.240
Yes.

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:51.930
I just wanted to see

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:53.870
what kind of woman

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.960
could actually change His Majesty.

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:08.020
So in your eyes,

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.540
I'm nothing more than a tiny skylark.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.069
I misjudged you.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.920
But His Majesty didn't.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.180
The world isn't just for roaming freely.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.700
She has her own ambitions.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.000
You only see her as a little bird

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.400
that needs to be set free,

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:24.680
but you fail to see

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.839
how upright and noble she is—

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:29.980
radiant as the sun,

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:32.650
able to light up the vast blue sky.

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:37.000
By the way,

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:39.760
do you have news of His Majesty?

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.080
We had agreed that

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.480
if he managed to escape alive,

00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.080
we'd rendezvous in Peiyang.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.240
So I hurried here to
take control of the place,

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.570
just to wait for you two.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.310
But

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.960
only you arrived.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.460
What about Prince Duan?

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.460
Is there any news?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.070
That scoundrel Prince Duan

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.720
claims His Majesty was suddenly
struck with a serious illness

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.070
and is recuperating inside the palace,

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.790
but whether it's true or not is unknown.

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:02.120
Is the source reliable?

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:05.590
The capital is sealed tight right now.

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:06.320
My spies will

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:07.820
need more time.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.200
Then...

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.060
Your Highness.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.220
It's getting late.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:17.750
You should get some rest.

00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:22.160
I will go and settle

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:23.960
the people you brought with you.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.200
Early tomorrow morning,

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.860
I'll show you something nice.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.100
I take my leave.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.620
Xiahou Dan.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.240
I've found the reinforcements.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.810
If you've truly been placed
under house arrest by Prince Duan,

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.930
wait for me.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.020
I'll definitely come to save you.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:01.210
Gentlemen.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:02.920
We've endured humiliation for so long

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:04.380
and finally gained power,

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.030
so why are you sighing?

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.990
Gained power?

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.790
Throughout history,

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.410
have you ever seen

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.520
an emperor sitting in a wheelchair?

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:16.090
So His Highness's leg can't be saved?

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.350
Don't ask.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:20.720
With the Empress Dowager
being assassinated and the Crown Prince

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.270
rebelling on one side, and the Emperor
gravely injured and the Empress in exile

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.480
on the other—
after such chaos in the court,

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.740
what's the point of holding court at all?

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:29.070
We nearly lost our lives

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.900
on Mount Bei.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.240
What a mess
the Imperial Observatory has made.

00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:35.880
They claimed it was an auspicious place,

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.790
but in my opinion,

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:38.370
it was complete nonsense.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.550
This is bad.

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:44.610
This is really bad.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:46.000
Prince Duan has surrounded
His Majesty's chambers

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.070
as tight as a drum.

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:48.200
I asked around everywhere

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.970
but couldn't get
the slightest bit of news.

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:50.430
This...

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.000
We must not lose our composure.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.720
If His Majesty had been killed,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.000
Prince Duan would have brought out
the Crown Prince to act as regent.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.420
There would be no need to
make such a commotion.

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:58.720
With traitors and rebels in power,

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.720
how can we sit idly by and do nothing?

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:04.200
Even if we have to risk our lives today,

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:05.670
we must force Prince Duan

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:07.760
to let us see His Majesty in person.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.070
My lords, silence please!

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:30.600
Regarding the Mount Bei incident,

00:20:31.790 --> 00:20:33.850
His Majesty suffered a severe shock.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.170
His head ailment has flared up,
and he needs rest.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.860
Therefore, the court affairs

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.850
will be temporarily handled by me.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.070
This...

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.640
This...

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.160
In these extraordinary times,

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:48.440
I hope you all will cooperate fully

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.260
to help His Majesty through this crisis.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:03.400
Gentlemen,

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.930
do any of you have any objections?

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.010
I have something to report, Your Majesty.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.740
Please speak, Lord Wu.

00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:43.980
How dare you!

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.490
Wu Jiadong,

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.160
as a high-ranking official
of the third rank,

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.070
with His Majesty absent,

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.200
who were you addressing as "Your Majesty"?

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.640
No, I...

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.440
-This...
-Do you intend to put
His Highness Prince Duan

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.240
in a position of treason and rebellion?

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.000
This... This is...

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.400
You...

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:02.070
I misspoke in the heat of the moment.

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.800
Please forgive me,
Your Highness Prince Duan.

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.470
Lord Wu simply made a slip of the tongue.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.230
Lord Li, Mr. Li Yunxi,

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.240
there's no need for such hostility.

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.310
We

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.080
live on His Majesty's salary

00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:22.280
and serve His Majesty loyally.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:24.680
If we disregard propriety and the law,

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.780
then we're unworthy of
being His Majesty's ministers.

00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.370
Then how do you intend to act
as a minister?

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:31.200
I

00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:35.460
would like to ask
Your Highness Prince Duan a question:

00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:37.770
when

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.000
can we have an audience with His Majesty?

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:49.760
I've already said it.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.930
His Majesty is critically ill

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.270
and needs to rest.

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:56.180
I prefer to see it for myself.

00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:57.840
Lord Li, are you implying

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:00.550
that I'm lying?

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.640
If there were an imperial decree as proof,

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.300
I naturally

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:05.230
would have no objection.

00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.510
But now, Your Highness Prince Duan
has nothing to show

00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:11.550
yet wishes to act as regent.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.250
May I ask—

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.230
where is His Majesty,

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:15.680
where is the Crown Prince,

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.300
and where is the Empress?

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:31.030
Are you asking me about
that demonic empress?

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.330
I also wish to catch that culprit.

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.040
However, I heard

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.000
that you, Lord Li,

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.870
were highly favored by
that demonic empress.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.780
Do you happen to know where she is?

00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:43.030
I...

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.860
I

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.890
observed the stars last night.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:48.890
The Emperor Star was dim,

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.680
and the Treasury Star appeared,

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.790
yet it was also shrouded by dark clouds—

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:54.880
much like the current state of affairs,

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.210
where things are unclear
as if viewing flowers through fog.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:01.200
Therefore, what Lord Li meant was that

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.350
the Mount Bei incident
is highly suspicious,

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:05.480
with many doubts still unresolved, so

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:08.040
it's far too early
to draw a final conclusion.

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:08.510
But...

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:09.400
But

00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.400
His Highness Prince Duan would never

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.030
base the guilt of the Empress

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:17.540
solely on the word of a mere assassin.

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:18.490
Of course

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.240
we'll need to wait for His Majesty
to wake up, right?

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:21.900
Lord Yang.

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.110
You are mistaken, Lord Yang.

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:26.550
Lord Li's request to see His Majesty

00:24:26.550 --> 00:24:29.400
concerns matters of state
handled by all departments.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:31.600
What does that have to do with the harem?

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.750
Especially for our Ministry of Revenue—

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:35.110
we have no interest

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:36.590
in His Majesty's private affairs.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:37.400
Am I right,

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.390
Lord Chen?

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:48.070
The Ministry of Revenue
has many pressing matters

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.200
that indeed require

00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.680
an audience with His Majesty

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.810
as soon as possible.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.140
Exactly.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:57.640
The Mount Bei incident caused the deaths
and injuries of many court ministers.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.230
Personnel changes cannot be enacted

00:25:00.550 --> 00:25:02.830
without His Majesty's seal.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.250
The Empress Dowager's coffin

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:07.000
hasn't been interred, either.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.480
The mausoleum construction
is not yet finished.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.960
I do wish to proceed with the burial,

00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.190
but how could I?

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.340
-That's right.
-Exactly.

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.590
Exactly.

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.400
Indeed.

00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:26.920
Silence!

00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:31.600
Once His Majesty has recovered a little,

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.690
he'll naturally summon you all.

00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:47.830
And when will that be?

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:48.440
When?

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.070
Your Highness Prince Duan,

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:51.070
when will that be!

00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.270
Nine Heavens Mystical Fire
Repeating Sleeve Crossbows.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.240
How many do we have?

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.370
Your Highness,

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.520
there are thousands of them,

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.740
plus dozens of crates of ammunition.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.630
The blueprints

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:21.030
were sent by His Majesty.

00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.860
To prevent them from being intercepted
along the way,

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.680
the crossbows were
dismantled into countless components

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.350
and delivered in over 10 shipments.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.410
We then enlisted the best craftsmen,

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.080
and after several failures,

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.570
we finally put together the first one.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:34.440
These sleeve crossbows

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.270
were extremely difficult to obtain,

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:38.030
but their combat power is unparalleled.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:38.480
Even

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:42.480
against tens of thousands of troops
of the other two armies,

00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:44.240
they'll crush them like dry weeds,

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.240
without shedding a drop of our own blood.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.840
Thank you for your hard work.

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:53.330
Today,

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.400
our army marches.

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.000
At the highlands 500 li from the capital,

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.590
we can intercept
the Left and Central Armies.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.880
We

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.240
have endured in silence for years,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.570
sleeping on our spears,

00:27:04.510 --> 00:27:06.880
just waiting for today—
the moment of certain victory.

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.790
Prince Duan conspires in rebellion

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.190
and acts as a pawn of evil.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.960
Just give the order, Your Highness,

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:14.800
and we will

00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:17.830
execute him for the sake of the realm.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.890
Execute him for the sake of the realm!

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:24.080
General Lin.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.150
Let's have a word in private.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.920
His Majesty's whereabouts
are still unknown.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:33.050
If we attack rashly,

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:35.550
and he really is in Prince Duan's hands,

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.680
what will we do then?

00:27:37.790 --> 00:27:39.450
This is the final secret edict

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:41.640
His Majesty gave me before I departed.

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:44.780
[Order Crown Prince to succeed the throne;
confer Yu Wanyin as Empress Dowager]

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.480
[Promote Li Yunxi and Yang Duojie
to assist in managing state affairs]

00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:46.680
[Traitor Xiahou Bo shall be executed
without hesitation. Put the realm first]

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:47.680
He wants the Crown Prince
to succeed the throne

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:48.740
[at all times; do not concern yourselves
with my life or death]

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.310
and me to become the Empress Dowager?

00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:52.170
Only in this way

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.440
can you justifiably
hold control over the court.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.900
He's also left behind many

00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:58.680
to assist in governing state affairs.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.240
Traitor Xiahou Bo shall be executed
without hesitation.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:03.040
Put the realm first at all times;

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:05.970
do not concern yourselves with
my life or death.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:06.720
He knew

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:09.170
he didn't have much time left.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.590
He didn't want to become a burden
to you in his final moments,

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.920
nor did he wish to be humiliated
in the enemy camp.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.030
If, by misfortune, he were captured
by Prince Duan,

00:28:16.030 --> 00:28:18.630
he would find a way to
perish together with him.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.590
And if even that were impossible,

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:21.250
he would...

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.000
Take his own life.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:25.750
So you just

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.240
gave up on him as a matter of course?

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.040
Of course not!

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:30.400
I've seized every possible chance
to look for him.

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.150
Then find him first
before mobilizing the troops!

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.920
You know there isn't enough time.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.640
The rebels are marching toward
the capital day and night.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.160
Prince Duan is scouring everywhere
for you,

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.360
and he'll soon trace you to my location.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.640
But if Xiahou Dan's safety
cannot be guaranteed,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:44.190
none of this means anything.

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:45.480
His Majesty's final secret edict

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:46.830
was precisely to force us
to consider the bigger picture

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.090
and act without delay.

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.000
Lin Xuanying.

00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:52.350
Why are you so eager
to mobilize the troops?

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:54.080
What exactly are you planning?

00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:57.670
Whether you believe me or not,

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.930
I have absolutely no interest in
any of this.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.270
I only came here

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:05.160
on Master's orders to assist His Majesty,

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.200
and His Majesty asked me to
take orders from you.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:07.930
Then my order

00:29:08.030 --> 00:29:09.960
is to save him at all costs.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.970
General.

00:29:16.510 --> 00:29:17.040
General,

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:19.110
shall we distribute these sleeve crossbows

00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:20.000
to the army

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.720
and issue orders to prepare for battle?

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.380
Deputy General of the Right Army,
Lin Xuanying!

00:29:29.410 --> 00:29:29.880
Yes.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.690
His Majesty ordered you to obey me,

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:34.000
didn't he?

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:36.750
Yes.

00:29:37.010 --> 00:29:38.520
Then I hereby order you

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:41.360
to discard this secret edict.

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:43.720
From this moment on,

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:46.110
you do

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:48.380
as I say.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.870
My lords.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:10.800
Lord Li.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:22.320
My lords,

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:24.730
it is freezing out here.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:25.510
Please

00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:27.530
go back for now.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.880
Eunuch An.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:31.370
His Majesty

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:33.910
has always treated you well.

00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.170
Why do you now

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.160
only take orders from Prince Duan?

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.870
Besides, we are kneeling here

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.920
only to pray for His Majesty.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.050
Why is that not allowed?

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.200
We will not leave today

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:50.190
until we see His Majesty.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:52.630
Lord Chen.

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.380
That's right, Eunuch An.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.790
Didn't we make it clear

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.090
in the court?

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.030
The state affairs are complicated

00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:03.210
and cannot wait.

00:31:03.510 --> 00:31:06.790
We beg to see His Majesty!

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:13.070
My lords,

00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:15.610
please heed my advice.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.790
Right now, the last thing
His Majesty wants to see

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.750
is a scene like this.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.240
As for the complicated state affairs,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:24.300
please handle them

00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.770
yourselves for now.

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:27.970
The situation is chaotic.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:29.200
It would be better

00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.260
to observe quietly

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:31.940
before acting.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:35.350
You're all pillars of Great Xia.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:38.500
At this moment,

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.020
besides head-on confrontation,

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.820
what's more important is
to protect yourselves

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.310
and proceed with careful planning.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.080
Eunuch An,

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.960
there's no need to advise us further.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.820
We don't speak the same language.

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.550
We

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:53.210
will not leave.

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:55.960
Eunuch An!

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:57.290
Eunuch An!

00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:59.120
Bad news!

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.010
Bad news!

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.740
His... His Majesty...

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:05.450
His Majesty...

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:09.970
His Majesty has passed away!

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.510
Your Majesty.

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.640
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:22.800
Your Majesty.

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:27.830
Your Majesty!

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:35.920
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.730
I'll take good care of
the young Crown Prince for you.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:43.640
In these troubled times,

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:47.570
our state cannot go a day without a ruler.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.200
Let's prepare for the Crown Prince's
enthronement ceremony immediately.

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.680
Where are the Yulin Guards?

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.210
Present!

00:32:57.510 --> 00:33:00.640
Escort the lords back to their residences
to rest for now

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.880
and prepare to
observe the mourning period.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:02.160
Yes!

00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:07.480
Report!

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.560
General,

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.790
urgent news from the capital!

00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.200
His Majesty has passed away!

00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:13.990
Nonsense!

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.810
Go and verify this news.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:19.560
Go now!

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:20.030
Yes!

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.570
Continue the march!

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.020
Your Highness,

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.570
you heard it, right?

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680
That's good news.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.020
Your Highness?

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:41.920
If Prince Duan had really captured
His Majesty,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.250
given his personality,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:46.240
there's no way
he would have let His Majesty die.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.110
After all, only a living hostage
is a bargaining chip.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:50.170
As for His Majesty,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.150
no matter what he said to you,

00:33:52.590 --> 00:33:54.160
before confirming my safety,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.920
he would never take his own life.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.160
So this news of his death actually proves

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.760
that His Majesty is not
in Prince Duan's hands.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:02.030
It must be so.

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:03.710
Could it be

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.350
because of His Majesty's illness...

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.860
No.

00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:10.250
He said he would never leave me alone.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:13.550
He absolutely wouldn't break his promise.

00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:14.000
Your Highness.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:14.659
Say no more.

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:17.630
Prince Duan is a master at
manipulating public opinion.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:18.489
I won't believe

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.159
a single word he says.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:36.960
We'll be encamping here tonight.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:37.760
The conditions are rough.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.110
Your Highness, you...

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:39.030
Don't worry about me.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.920
Focus on

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:41.889
finding His Majesty first.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:52.940
Didn't I tell you to leave?

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.770
How come you followed me here?

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.960
But I can't let you tag along.

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:39.730
It's not that I can't afford to feed you,

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.940
but we are going to war.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.140
It's very dangerous.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:43.960
You could lose your life.

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.710
But you are too young.

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.210
I can't use child labor, right?

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.840
Are you telling me

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:33.210
not to be afraid?

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:50.880
I know.

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:55.110
I'm not afraid.

00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.050
I'll definitely find him.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.140
Don't go outside.

00:37:58.140 --> 00:37:58.920
Wait for me here.
