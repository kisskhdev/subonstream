00:01:02.942 --> 00:01:04.933
Who is it?

00:01:09.787 --> 00:01:12.089
Why is my manager here...

00:01:12.089 --> 00:01:14.287
Hello, I'm the owner of Unit 206.

00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:15.663
The owner?

00:01:15.663 --> 00:01:17.492
The owner?

00:01:17.492 --> 00:01:19.713
- Of this place?
- Yeah...

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.285
Open the door.

00:01:32.972 --> 00:01:34.833
Please, just ten minutes.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.560
No, five. Don't say anything.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.501
- Okay?
- Hey, wait!

00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.988
What is she doing right now...

00:02:01.876 --> 00:02:03.965
Sir?

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:10.163
Woo Hyun Jin?

00:02:10.163 --> 00:02:13.951
Oh, yes. You can come in.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.679
Woo Hyun Jin, why are you here...

00:02:22.272 --> 00:02:24.406
I know.

00:02:25.233 --> 00:02:26.981
So...

00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:29.070
You're...

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.309
the owner here?

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.540
- Is that the guy?
- I looked like a total mess

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:41.749
in front of him today.

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:42.959
I know I looked awful.

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.772
Yes, sir.

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:45.079
He put his faith in me
and handed me this opportunity,

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.552
so I need to pour everything I have into this

00:02:46.552 --> 00:02:48.678
and deliver real results.

00:02:48.678 --> 00:02:50.638
This isn't who I am.

00:02:50.638 --> 00:02:52.927
I really am Suzy to him...

00:02:52.927 --> 00:02:55.138
He was my first love.

00:02:55.138 --> 00:02:57.964
Do you know how much I liked him?

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:28.968
What is this?

00:03:32.096 --> 00:03:34.682
Give me my bunny.

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:40.307
My bunny!

00:03:41.164 --> 00:03:43.154
Hey, kid...

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:05.633
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:08.473
What is going on here?

00:04:09.216 --> 00:04:11.185
Let's step outside.

00:04:11.185 --> 00:04:13.734
We should talk out there.

00:04:17.887 --> 00:04:19.901
Let's go.

00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:21.641
Can you watch Woo Joo for a minute?

00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:23.807
You're okay with that, huh?

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.087
This is so embarrassing.

00:04:39.163 --> 00:04:40.397
[Episode 5]
So... that's why

00:04:40.397 --> 00:04:44.039
I'm living here with him,
taking care of Woo Joo.

00:04:45.973 --> 00:04:48.226
That must've been hard.

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:53.028
But I guess it's better than being alone.

00:04:53.028 --> 00:04:56.039
For Woo Joo and for me.

00:04:57.783 --> 00:05:01.264
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:05:01.264 --> 00:05:02.706
No.

00:05:02.706 --> 00:05:05.653
I'm okay. My in-law is here.

00:05:12.692 --> 00:05:14.110
First of all,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.115
you need to rest.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:17.948
It's been nonstop for you since yesterday.

00:05:17.948 --> 00:05:20.573
And this morning, I probably startled you too.

00:05:20.573 --> 00:05:22.121
Let's go.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:24.140
Yoon Seong...

00:05:25.705 --> 00:05:28.538
I'm sorry I lied.

00:05:29.802 --> 00:05:32.920
It wasn't easy to explain.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.005
Still,

00:05:34.005 --> 00:05:36.549
I didn't have to lie about where I live.

00:05:36.549 --> 00:05:37.812
Yeah,

00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:40.458
that part did sting a little.

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:43.756
It made me wonder if I've become someone

00:05:43.756 --> 00:05:46.618
you feel the need to hide things from.

00:06:12.801 --> 00:06:15.979
Hey, Tae Hyung.

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:26.896
I'm sorry about earlier.

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:29.165
Well...

00:06:29.165 --> 00:06:32.063
I was caught off guard too.

00:06:32.063 --> 00:06:34.143
That's why...

00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:41.369
Are you okay where you fell?

00:06:42.828 --> 00:06:45.665
It looks like you might bruise.

00:06:47.618 --> 00:06:49.084
Hey.

00:06:49.084 --> 00:06:50.628
I know you're upset,

00:06:50.628 --> 00:06:52.338
but when someone apologizes,
you could at least...

00:06:52.338 --> 00:06:53.506
Apologize?

00:06:53.506 --> 00:06:54.757
For what?

00:06:55.966 --> 00:06:57.839
For shoving me and the baby into a room

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.437
like we were baggage

00:06:59.437 --> 00:07:01.144
when your first love showed up?

00:07:01.144 --> 00:07:02.736
Or...

00:07:03.945 --> 00:07:05.283
So you weren't busy working,

00:07:05.283 --> 00:07:07.536
you were busy rekindling things
with your first love

00:07:07.536 --> 00:07:09.104
to answer the phone when the kid got hurt?

00:07:09.104 --> 00:07:10.314
No.

00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:12.355
I told you earlier.

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:14.021
I was really busy working.

00:07:14.021 --> 00:07:15.398
You sure?

00:07:15.398 --> 00:07:18.280
You couldn't even say a word in front of him.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.024
Were you embarrassed to be raising a baby

00:07:20.024 --> 00:07:22.864
in front of your amazing first love?

00:07:22.864 --> 00:07:25.410
Don't talk like you know everything.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.118
I'm not embarrassed of Woo Joo at all.

00:07:27.118 --> 00:07:29.245
- Then were you embarrassed of me?
- Hey!

00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:31.289
Why are you twisting everything?

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.255
What did I do?

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:40.173
Forget it.

00:07:40.173 --> 00:07:43.236
Talking more won't change anything.

00:07:45.558 --> 00:07:48.060
Same here.

00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:54.187
What's his problem?

00:07:54.187 --> 00:07:57.207
Like my life isn't complicated enough.

00:08:00.906 --> 00:08:03.659
Beats me.

00:08:07.055 --> 00:08:09.681
This is so embarrassing.

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:19.324
Do you know why he's so pissed?

00:08:19.324 --> 00:08:21.839
Maybe it's that woman he's living with.

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:24.008
His moods have been all over the place lately.

00:08:24.008 --> 00:08:25.510
Isn't it because of her?

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:27.053
You mean... his in-law?

00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:29.013
I thought they were getting along fine.

00:08:29.013 --> 00:08:30.515
Fine? Not even close.

00:08:30.515 --> 00:08:32.391
When is that construction
even going to be done?

00:08:32.391 --> 00:08:36.484
Dragging the kid around everywhere
I go is exhausting.

00:08:43.699 --> 00:08:45.404
Living in that crappy place

00:08:45.404 --> 00:08:47.114
with that weird woman,

00:08:47.114 --> 00:08:50.039
I keep getting triggered over nothing.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:52.291
Triggered how, exactly?

00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:56.003
Don't even start. I had to meet her first love.

00:09:04.316 --> 00:09:07.382
[Photographer, Amy Choo]
You left without developing the photos.

00:09:09.553 --> 00:09:12.835
This is thin ice. Total thin ice.

00:09:13.937 --> 00:09:15.434
Tell me about it.

00:09:15.434 --> 00:09:16.894
We live in the same house.

00:09:16.894 --> 00:09:19.313
We can't keep it this awkward forever.

00:09:19.313 --> 00:09:22.321
We need to clear the air somehow.

00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:23.901
But Hyun Jin...

00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:25.212
You know what?

00:09:25.212 --> 00:09:28.786
I'm starting to
get suspicious of your roommate.

00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:30.383
- Why?
- Think about it.

00:09:30.383 --> 00:09:32.285
Sure, he could be annoyed you hid him.

00:09:32.285 --> 00:09:34.912
And he did trip and embarrass himself.

00:09:34.912 --> 00:09:37.652
But why was he that mad at you?

00:09:38.416 --> 00:09:39.834
What if...

00:09:39.834 --> 00:09:41.293
after that wild night,

00:09:41.293 --> 00:09:42.712
he started seeing you

00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:44.005
as a woman?

00:09:44.005 --> 00:09:46.007
Seriously, Se Yeon.

00:09:46.007 --> 00:09:47.846
Didn't I tell you to stop reading web novels?

00:09:47.846 --> 00:09:49.579
Your word choice is a little intense.

00:09:49.579 --> 00:09:52.468
And we are not like that.

00:10:13.956 --> 00:10:16.334
What are you doing here?

00:10:19.206 --> 00:10:22.126
I just got back from the archive.

00:10:22.126 --> 00:10:23.544
Let's head into the meeting.

00:10:23.544 --> 00:10:25.639
Okay.

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:31.927
What you're looking at now
are GloMarket's key needs.

00:10:31.927 --> 00:10:33.763
They want stronger storytelling

00:10:33.763 --> 00:10:36.974
for each individual product.

00:10:36.974 --> 00:10:38.605
So we'll be handling visual directing

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:40.978
with an external specialist team.

00:10:40.978 --> 00:10:42.313
Sir,

00:10:42.313 --> 00:10:45.274
the shortlist is already finalized, right?

00:10:45.274 --> 00:10:47.468
We've already reached out and sent proposals.

00:10:47.468 --> 00:10:50.134
I'll share updates once it's confirmed.

00:10:54.314 --> 00:10:56.487
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:10:58.207 --> 00:10:59.288
I'd like you

00:10:59.288 --> 00:11:02.280
to take on the storytelling strategy.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.786
Your narrative approach to K-food

00:11:03.786 --> 00:11:06.659
in the GloMarket proposal worked well.

00:11:06.659 --> 00:11:08.497
Put together a proposal with the concept

00:11:08.497 --> 00:11:11.023
and a structured story outline attached.

00:11:11.926 --> 00:11:14.970
Yes, got it.

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.113
You can head out now.

00:11:18.432 --> 00:11:20.476
Okay, then...

00:11:34.573 --> 00:11:36.455
I'm honestly speechless right now.

00:11:36.455 --> 00:11:38.064
Is it true that our great Amy Choo

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.917
mentioned Sun Tae Hyung in the interview?

00:11:39.917 --> 00:11:43.629
You know I hate stopping
in the middle of work. Right?

00:11:43.629 --> 00:11:45.000
Eat while you listen.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.340
Have you ever once mentioned my name

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:48.759
while working with me?

00:11:48.759 --> 00:11:51.216
Jo Moo Saeng.

00:11:51.216 --> 00:11:53.531
Congratulations on your retirement.

00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:56.470
You're finally free from me.

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.276
I'm passing Sun Tae Hyung.

00:11:59.276 --> 00:12:01.729
What, not happy?

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.770
No, I'm so happy.

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:06.605
So where should I travel next?

00:12:06.605 --> 00:12:08.695
Book your ticket for a month from now.

00:12:08.695 --> 00:12:11.616
Wrap up your handover properly.

00:12:12.584 --> 00:12:15.077
And you still haven't signed
the divorce papers.

00:12:15.077 --> 00:12:16.574
Why not?

00:12:16.574 --> 00:12:19.762
After twenty years of putting up with you,

00:12:19.762 --> 00:12:21.746
you think I'd sign those terms?

00:12:21.746 --> 00:12:23.205
I want alimony.

00:12:23.205 --> 00:12:26.046
And my share of the assets. The house too.

00:12:26.046 --> 00:12:28.043
Then book your ticket a year from now.

00:12:28.043 --> 00:12:30.809
This lawsuit's going to drag on.

00:12:38.709 --> 00:12:41.148
What about Kkotnim?

00:12:41.148 --> 00:12:44.462
Don't even think about seeing her.

00:12:47.354 --> 00:12:48.397
Fine. I won't.

00:12:48.397 --> 00:12:50.736
Just sign the papers.

00:12:51.465 --> 00:12:53.390
Come in.

00:13:04.705 --> 00:13:06.835
You didn't bring the baby today?

00:13:06.835 --> 00:13:09.418
I left the baby with a friend for a bit.

00:13:09.418 --> 00:13:11.879
You've got some nerve.

00:13:11.879 --> 00:13:13.760
Leaving your film and camera behind.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.472
Were you expecting me to develop it?

00:13:17.508 --> 00:13:18.515
I'm sorry.

00:13:18.515 --> 00:13:20.292
I already looked at them.

00:13:20.292 --> 00:13:24.098
You don't think
this is a baby photo studio, do you?

00:13:29.943 --> 00:13:32.321
Hey, kid.

00:13:34.793 --> 00:13:37.907
You got picked because of this.

00:13:37.907 --> 00:13:40.324
Especially this shot.

00:13:42.228 --> 00:13:44.273
There's heart in it.

00:13:44.273 --> 00:13:46.244
Working with film gives you space. Right?

00:13:46.244 --> 00:13:49.604
You wait for it.
You imagine what it'll look like.

00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:51.340
That's what makes it fun.

00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.343
Your shots were interesting too.

00:13:55.677 --> 00:13:59.134
I'm not good at waiting.

00:13:59.134 --> 00:14:01.099
That's why I don't really work with film.

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:03.394
It's not my thing.

00:14:04.102 --> 00:14:06.149
Yeah?

00:14:06.149 --> 00:14:08.120
Then what's this?

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.467
- Your wife?
- Huh?

00:14:14.467 --> 00:14:16.485
- Or your girlfriend?
- No. Never.

00:14:16.485 --> 00:14:19.113
They say strong denial means it's true.

00:14:19.113 --> 00:14:22.575
Mine's genuinely a "no."

00:14:22.575 --> 00:14:24.456
Anyway.

00:14:24.456 --> 00:14:27.526
Here's a proposal that came in.

00:14:27.526 --> 00:14:29.623
Take a look at your next project.

00:14:29.623 --> 00:14:32.543
Put that same heart into it.

00:14:32.543 --> 00:14:34.503
Because this first project

00:14:34.503 --> 00:14:37.202
is going to be your salary.

00:14:53.647 --> 00:14:56.032
But the lens doesn't lie.

00:14:56.972 --> 00:14:58.527
The way you look at someone.

00:14:58.527 --> 00:15:00.597
The heart you put into the shot.

00:15:00.597 --> 00:15:03.346
You don't get moments like that
without affection.

00:15:03.346 --> 00:15:06.626
In the end, the camera reflects your heart.

00:15:06.626 --> 00:15:07.870
No.

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:09.733
"Affection?" Not even close.

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:11.128
Let's go, kid.

00:15:11.128 --> 00:15:14.471
I need to make things right with your aunt.

00:15:14.471 --> 00:15:16.819
Got any bright ideas?

00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:22.890
And how am I supposed to fix things with him?

00:15:24.013 --> 00:15:26.523
I should apologize first, right?

00:15:27.262 --> 00:15:29.342
Hyun Jin?

00:15:30.752 --> 00:15:32.583
Hello.

00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:34.303
Just a second...

00:15:34.303 --> 00:15:35.461
Good to see you here.

00:15:35.461 --> 00:15:37.464
I was meaning to talk to you.

00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:39.526
Want to go camping tomorrow?

00:15:39.526 --> 00:15:40.569
Camping?

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:41.773
The weather's nice.

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:43.240
We could let the kids run around.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.583
It'd be a good change of pace.

00:15:45.583 --> 00:15:48.160
Right now, it seems...

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.156
more psychological than physical.

00:15:59.009 --> 00:16:01.512
Oh, are you packing?

00:16:02.554 --> 00:16:05.307
Got the bug spray...

00:16:05.307 --> 00:16:07.846
Are they planning to play in the water?

00:16:07.846 --> 00:16:09.550
Should we pack an extra outfit for you?

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:13.852
Just in case,

00:16:13.852 --> 00:16:16.412
we should bring everything.

00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.526
Hey... well...

00:16:55.144 --> 00:16:57.130
What is it?

00:16:57.776 --> 00:17:01.197
Would you like to come camping with us?

00:17:02.609 --> 00:17:03.865
All of a sudden?

00:17:03.865 --> 00:17:06.113
It's such a nice day.

00:17:06.113 --> 00:17:09.521
I thought it'd be nice to take Woo Joo out.

00:17:09.521 --> 00:17:11.466
And you remember...

00:17:11.466 --> 00:17:12.651
they said Woo Joo needs

00:17:12.651 --> 00:17:14.747
attentive care from his guardians, right?

00:17:14.747 --> 00:17:16.294
This is part of that.

00:17:16.294 --> 00:17:18.756
Well... okay.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:20.632
Oh, really?

00:17:20.632 --> 00:17:22.651
I told you I'm going. You don't trust me?

00:17:22.651 --> 00:17:24.841
There you go again, talking like that.

00:17:24.841 --> 00:17:27.468
Everything else is perfectly set up,

00:17:27.468 --> 00:17:30.429
so we just show up and relax.

00:17:30.429 --> 00:17:32.608
Wait, it's not just the three of us?

00:17:32.608 --> 00:17:34.925
Stop it! Where's my jelly?

00:17:34.925 --> 00:17:36.018
Daddy!

00:17:36.018 --> 00:17:37.061
Mommy!

00:17:37.061 --> 00:17:39.563
Lee Bom keeps throwing snacks at me!

00:17:39.563 --> 00:17:42.316
Lee Bom,
I told you not to pick on your brother.

00:17:42.316 --> 00:17:45.482
Mommy, Lee Yeo Reum ate all my jelly!

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:47.362
I didn't!

00:17:47.362 --> 00:17:49.278
Actually... I'm the one eating it.

00:17:49.278 --> 00:17:50.991
Daddy!

00:17:50.991 --> 00:17:52.394
Hey! Don't throw that!

00:17:52.394 --> 00:17:54.119
Come on...

00:17:54.119 --> 00:17:55.287
Knock it off!

00:17:55.287 --> 00:17:58.628
You didn't say there would be this many kids.

00:17:58.628 --> 00:18:02.544
It'll feel totally relaxing once we get there.

00:18:02.544 --> 00:18:03.670
Stop it!

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.880
I said stop!

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.348
You stop!

00:18:13.341 --> 00:18:16.141
This is going to take forever.
Just give it to me.

00:18:16.141 --> 00:18:19.361
Oh, you know how to set up a tent?

00:18:19.949 --> 00:18:22.435
Want me to show you how it's done?

00:18:47.939 --> 00:18:50.499
Pull that a little.

00:18:54.684 --> 00:18:57.103
You said you were good at this.

00:18:57.103 --> 00:18:59.898
Didn't you say you could set up
a 24-man military tent in five minutes?

00:18:59.898 --> 00:19:01.779
This is...

00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:04.110
Something's seriously wrong with it.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:05.534
The slots don't even line up.

00:19:05.534 --> 00:19:08.156
This thing's defective.

00:19:08.156 --> 00:19:09.638
Need some help?

00:19:09.638 --> 00:19:11.080
Really?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.286
No, we've got it. It's basically done.

00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:16.124
Just go play with your kids.

00:19:26.007 --> 00:19:27.050
Finally... done.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:28.696
See? No big deal.

00:19:28.696 --> 00:19:30.095
Tent attack!

00:19:30.095 --> 00:19:32.232
Nice try, kid.

00:19:32.232 --> 00:19:34.112
Nice!

00:19:41.232 --> 00:19:43.265
Run!

00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:48.137
Oh, my back...

00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:53.053
Story of my life.

00:19:53.053 --> 00:19:55.353
Good work.

00:19:58.319 --> 00:20:00.710
I realized something.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.098
What?

00:20:03.098 --> 00:20:05.545
I hate camping.

00:20:06.635 --> 00:20:08.248
Still,

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:11.235
I think we achieved our goal.

00:20:23.067 --> 00:20:25.008
Woo Joo!

00:20:25.972 --> 00:20:28.232
Come here. Let's play.

00:20:31.594 --> 00:20:33.852
He does look happy.

00:20:33.852 --> 00:20:35.795
Woo Joo.

00:20:48.777 --> 00:20:50.661
- Hey...
- Uh...

00:20:57.342 --> 00:20:59.074
You

00:20:59.074 --> 00:21:01.115
go first.

00:21:02.201 --> 00:21:04.294
You know...

00:21:13.345 --> 00:21:14.746
About yesterday, I was a little...

00:21:14.746 --> 00:21:17.339
Hyun Jin! I think Woo Joo pooped.

00:21:17.339 --> 00:21:19.393
Okay, hold on.

00:21:19.393 --> 00:21:21.445
Just a second.

00:21:23.378 --> 00:21:24.807
Woo Joo, did you pee?

00:21:24.807 --> 00:21:27.698
Great timing.

00:21:32.879 --> 00:21:33.919
Excuse me, Mr. Sun.

00:21:33.919 --> 00:21:35.661
Could you take a picture of me?

00:21:35.661 --> 00:21:38.298
So I can send it to my boyfriend.

00:21:43.250 --> 00:21:47.323
You already have a boyfriend at your age?

00:21:49.864 --> 00:21:51.718
Come here. I will take it.

00:21:51.718 --> 00:21:53.530
By the way, I am not a mister.
I am a young uncle.

00:21:53.530 --> 00:21:55.366
Let's go.

00:22:01.583 --> 00:22:03.384
That's it.

00:22:09.992 --> 00:22:11.226
- Wow.
- Two.

00:22:11.226 --> 00:22:12.392
You have two?

00:22:12.392 --> 00:22:13.772
One, two.

00:22:13.772 --> 00:22:15.899
- Peace.
- Peace.

00:22:15.899 --> 00:22:17.568
Do a peace sign.

00:22:17.568 --> 00:22:19.804
I don't want to.

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.876
I'm recording a video right now.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:29.756
Peace!

00:22:29.756 --> 00:22:32.214
That's so fast.

00:22:38.114 --> 00:22:39.974
So tired.

00:22:42.317 --> 00:22:44.219
These kids never get tired.

00:22:44.219 --> 00:22:46.552
What are they, wild animals?

00:23:02.368 --> 00:23:05.662
[Manager Park Yoon Seong]

00:23:08.813 --> 00:23:10.946
You two are in-laws?

00:23:10.946 --> 00:23:15.361
I thought you were either dating or cousins.

00:23:15.361 --> 00:23:16.920
In-laws never crossed my mind.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.657
Dating? Please. No way.

00:23:19.657 --> 00:23:22.371
Absolutely not.

00:23:22.371 --> 00:23:25.689
In-laws are not really family, right?

00:23:25.689 --> 00:23:27.017
That is kind of awkward.

00:23:27.017 --> 00:23:28.968
Was it not uncomfortable?

00:23:28.968 --> 00:23:30.755
It was.

00:23:30.755 --> 00:23:32.332
Honestly,

00:23:32.332 --> 00:23:35.978
there are a lot of things we do not agree on.

00:23:35.978 --> 00:23:37.312
But what can I do?

00:23:37.312 --> 00:23:39.208
We are not really family anyway.

00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:42.594
And he is moving out soon.

00:23:43.234 --> 00:23:46.100
I will be raising Woo Joo on my own.

00:23:55.745 --> 00:23:56.959
Alright, let us eat.

00:23:56.959 --> 00:23:58.418
Who wants meat?

00:23:58.418 --> 00:23:59.503
Me.

00:23:59.503 --> 00:24:00.614
Yeah?

00:24:00.614 --> 00:24:02.654
This turned out great.

00:24:02.654 --> 00:24:04.287
It smells so good.

00:24:04.287 --> 00:24:06.400
Eat up.

00:24:07.978 --> 00:24:09.145
Say "thank you" for him.

00:24:09.145 --> 00:24:11.862
- Thank you, Dad.
- Thank you, Dad.

00:24:11.862 --> 00:24:14.276
Sausage.

00:24:14.276 --> 00:24:15.302
You are eating well.

00:24:15.302 --> 00:24:16.877
It is delicious.

00:24:16.877 --> 00:24:19.090
Is it?

00:24:22.084 --> 00:24:23.912
Woo Joo's uncle is not eating.

00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:26.229
I checked the tent earlier. He was not there.

00:24:26.229 --> 00:24:27.885
Where did he go?

00:24:27.885 --> 00:24:29.962
Go ahead and eat.

00:24:30.659 --> 00:24:32.564
Where did Uncle go?

00:24:32.564 --> 00:24:33.935
Tae Hyung!

00:24:33.935 --> 00:24:35.904
Tae Hyung!

00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:42.589
Did he not hear me?

00:24:43.521 --> 00:24:45.614
Tae Hyung!

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:47.850
Hey.

00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:49.547
Are you feeling sick?

00:24:49.547 --> 00:24:51.571
No.

00:24:51.571 --> 00:24:52.810
Then...

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.246
Is something wrong?

00:24:55.246 --> 00:24:57.111
No.

00:24:57.983 --> 00:25:00.043
You are not eating? It is really good.

00:25:00.043 --> 00:25:01.818
No, thank you. I am fine.

00:25:01.818 --> 00:25:03.136
Why not?

00:25:03.136 --> 00:25:04.636
Just eat. Do not worry about me.

00:25:04.636 --> 00:25:07.516
Come on, just one bite.

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:08.558
It is Iberico pork neck.

00:25:08.558 --> 00:25:11.479
- Just try one bite.
- I said I am fine.

00:25:13.041 --> 00:25:15.714
Why are you acting like this?

00:25:19.482 --> 00:25:21.565
- I said I am not eating.
- I am sorry.

00:25:21.565 --> 00:25:24.242
I guess I was bothering you.

00:25:27.927 --> 00:25:31.372
Look, that uncle is such a piece of work.

00:25:31.372 --> 00:25:34.001
Lee Bom, use kind words.

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:37.318
- Why?
- Watch your language.

00:25:37.318 --> 00:25:40.179
She picked that up from you.

00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:56.235
Seriously, what is wrong with him?

00:25:56.235 --> 00:25:58.276
Such a waste of good meat.

00:25:58.276 --> 00:26:00.151
We came all the way here to get along.

00:26:00.151 --> 00:26:02.572
Why is he acting like that?

00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.485
- Hello?
- It is me.

00:26:09.485 --> 00:26:12.764
I texted you, but you didn't reply, so...

00:26:12.764 --> 00:26:15.617
I'm sorry. I didn't see it.

00:26:15.617 --> 00:26:16.709
Is something wrong?

00:26:16.709 --> 00:26:17.919
GloMarket says

00:26:17.919 --> 00:26:19.993
they sent over the local food safety standards,

00:26:19.993 --> 00:26:21.954
but I think they sent it to your email,
not mine.

00:26:21.954 --> 00:26:22.965
Can you forward it to me?

00:26:22.965 --> 00:26:24.945
Sure, just a second.

Oh, you must be out right now.

00:26:32.164 --> 00:26:34.563
Sorry.

00:26:34.563 --> 00:26:35.603
It's okay.

00:26:35.603 --> 00:26:38.733
I'm camping with Woo Joo.

00:26:39.907 --> 00:26:41.010
I just sent it.

00:26:41.010 --> 00:26:43.039
Okay, thanks.

00:26:43.039 --> 00:26:44.644
By the way,

00:26:44.644 --> 00:26:48.196
they also sent
the projected strategy plan by country.

00:26:48.196 --> 00:26:49.935
Did you get that?

00:26:49.935 --> 00:26:51.005
What?

00:26:51.005 --> 00:26:52.287
I couldn't hear you.

00:26:52.287 --> 00:26:54.376
Hold on.

[Off Limits]

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:08.914
- Why isn't Hyun Jin back yet?
- Are you not eating?

00:27:08.914 --> 00:27:10.247
Here.

00:27:10.247 --> 00:27:11.958
Excuse me, Woo Joo's uncle.

00:27:11.958 --> 00:27:14.472
Is it going to take her much longer?

00:27:14.472 --> 00:27:16.732
It is already dark.

00:27:17.331 --> 00:27:19.941
I am not sure.

00:27:19.941 --> 00:27:22.069
Why don't you try calling her?

00:27:22.069 --> 00:27:25.556
I did. Her phone is completely off.

00:27:26.519 --> 00:27:29.159
And honestly, were you not a bit harsh?

00:27:29.159 --> 00:27:31.881
Hyun Jin thinks very highly of you.

00:27:31.881 --> 00:27:33.648
I already heard...

00:27:33.648 --> 00:27:36.063
Huh? Heard what?

00:27:36.063 --> 00:27:37.929
She feels really sad

00:27:37.929 --> 00:27:40.449
about you moving out.

00:27:41.519 --> 00:27:43.690
And he is moving out soon.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:45.726
So...

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:49.617
I am sad.

00:27:50.374 --> 00:27:53.317
At first, it felt awkward.

00:27:53.317 --> 00:27:56.758
I honestly doubted
we could ever live under the same roof...

00:27:57.424 --> 00:27:59.123
But now...

00:27:59.123 --> 00:28:01.437
I'm going to miss him.

00:28:03.088 --> 00:28:06.184
Once he leaves,

00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:08.483
it feels like he will never see Woo Joo again,

00:28:08.483 --> 00:28:10.856
or me.

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.950
Still, he is a good person.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.094
Well,

00:28:17.094 --> 00:28:19.690
he complains sometimes, but...

00:28:20.442 --> 00:28:23.292
I get him now.

00:28:23.292 --> 00:28:25.505
She said you are just not great with words,

00:28:25.505 --> 00:28:27.066
but you are better than you seem.

00:28:27.066 --> 00:28:29.092
She also said you are really warm with Woo Joo.

00:28:29.092 --> 00:28:31.427
She was praising you like that,
and you throw a plate?

00:28:31.427 --> 00:28:33.714
That was too much.

00:28:36.098 --> 00:28:37.670
Could you watch the baby for a moment?

Okay, please.

gray sweatpants and a blue jacket...

No, I haven't seen her.

Sorry.

- Hey...

00:29:45.296 --> 00:29:47.989
- It's you, right?
- Hyun Jin!

00:30:07.134 --> 00:30:09.179
Hyun Jin...

00:30:13.731 --> 00:30:16.156
This is driving me crazy.

Tae Hyung...

00:30:17.923 --> 00:30:19.430
Why did you come all the way out here?

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.718
I thought that path earlier...

00:30:21.718 --> 00:30:23.955
people were walking back and forth,

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:26.306
so I assumed it was a trail...

00:30:26.306 --> 00:30:28.443
- But it kept getting stranger and stranger...
- What are you even saying?

00:30:28.443 --> 00:30:30.989
I don't even know where I am...

00:30:30.989 --> 00:30:33.563
Just wait there. I'm coming to you.

00:30:43.881 --> 00:30:46.181
Stand up first.

00:30:47.424 --> 00:30:50.741
Are you hurt? Did you twist your ankle?

00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:52.764
Hold this.

00:30:55.659 --> 00:30:57.572
Be careful.

00:31:02.947 --> 00:31:04.015
Be careful.

00:31:04.015 --> 00:31:06.001
It's slippery.

00:31:07.006 --> 00:31:09.274
Yes, I found her.

00:31:09.274 --> 00:31:12.293
Woo Joo's doing okay, right?

00:31:12.895 --> 00:31:14.927
Okay.

00:31:24.523 --> 00:31:25.632
I'm fine.

00:31:25.632 --> 00:31:27.379
No, hurry.

00:31:27.379 --> 00:31:29.107
We need to check it.

00:31:29.107 --> 00:31:32.658
If the blood dries,
it'll stick to your clothes.

00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:43.728
It's all scraped up.

00:31:47.982 --> 00:31:49.921
Does it hurt?

00:32:12.501 --> 00:32:14.807
We should go to a hospital first.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:30.701
Thank you.

00:32:30.701 --> 00:32:33.594
For coming to find me.

00:32:33.594 --> 00:32:37.407
I was really scared back there.

00:32:39.227 --> 00:32:40.634
But when I heard your voice,

00:32:40.634 --> 00:32:42.805
I felt relieved.

00:32:46.768 --> 00:32:48.635
I guess...

00:32:50.402 --> 00:32:53.705
I rely on you more than I thought.

00:32:56.275 --> 00:32:57.861
Well,

00:32:57.861 --> 00:33:01.040
if you're stranded alone in the woods,

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.647
you'd feel relieved
seeing even your worst enemy.

00:33:03.647 --> 00:33:05.022
Come on.

00:33:05.022 --> 00:33:06.827
When someone says thank you, just take it.

00:33:06.827 --> 00:33:09.665
That emotional moment lasted,
what, thirty seconds?

00:33:16.288 --> 00:33:18.148
You...

00:33:18.148 --> 00:33:20.880
You hate rainy days, right?

00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.261
You're completely soaked.

00:33:23.261 --> 00:33:25.104
It's not...

00:33:25.965 --> 00:33:29.458
It's not that I hate getting wet.

00:33:29.458 --> 00:33:32.351
Then why do you hate them?

00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.559
For the opposite reason you do.

00:33:41.573 --> 00:33:44.114
You said you liked rainy days

00:33:44.852 --> 00:33:47.453
because your sister would always come get you.

00:33:47.453 --> 00:33:49.286
Right?

00:33:53.466 --> 00:33:55.807
For me, when it rained...

00:33:56.976 --> 00:34:00.276
I remember waiting for someone
for a very long time.

00:34:09.310 --> 00:34:12.123
I remember expecting that person to come.

00:34:13.647 --> 00:34:16.054
But that expectation

00:34:17.373 --> 00:34:19.646
was never met. Not even once.

00:34:21.515 --> 00:34:24.061
That's why I hate rainy days.

00:34:32.624 --> 00:34:36.919
You knew that was about Sun Woo Jin,
the one you care so much about. Right?

00:34:38.169 --> 00:34:40.548
He's not even that good of a brother.

00:34:45.426 --> 00:34:48.012
Well, we should head back.

00:34:48.012 --> 00:34:50.433
Looks like the rain's stopped.

00:34:53.590 --> 00:34:56.177
I'll come get you.

00:35:01.513 --> 00:35:03.836
Well...

00:35:03.836 --> 00:35:05.988
I can't promise every time,

00:35:05.988 --> 00:35:07.821
but sometimes...

00:35:09.325 --> 00:35:12.413
sometimes I'll come meet you.

00:35:13.095 --> 00:35:14.955
So if there's a day

00:35:14.955 --> 00:35:18.748
when you're stuck in the rain
without an umbrella,

00:35:18.748 --> 00:35:21.697
just call me.

00:35:21.697 --> 00:35:24.477
I'll be your umbrella.

00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:47.363
Hey...

00:35:47.363 --> 00:35:48.489
Tae Hyung.

00:35:48.489 --> 00:35:50.729
Do not ask if you're heavy.

00:35:50.729 --> 00:35:52.525
It is cliché.

00:35:52.525 --> 00:35:53.914
And you should gain some weight.

00:35:53.914 --> 00:35:56.367
You might blow away in the wind.

00:35:58.655 --> 00:36:01.126
Do not swing your legs.

00:36:01.126 --> 00:36:02.211
It is dangerous.

00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:04.298
I might drop you.

00:36:08.665 --> 00:36:10.804
So...

00:36:10.804 --> 00:36:13.168
Are we friends now?

00:36:14.843 --> 00:36:16.203
Friends?

00:36:16.203 --> 00:36:18.823
You know, we are the same age.

00:36:18.823 --> 00:36:20.368
When people fight and make up,

00:36:20.368 --> 00:36:22.583
do they not usually become friends?

00:36:22.583 --> 00:36:24.498
What do you think?

00:36:24.498 --> 00:36:25.914
No thanks.

00:36:25.914 --> 00:36:27.944
Why not?

00:36:31.354 --> 00:36:32.575
Oh, right.

00:36:32.575 --> 00:36:34.543
We are a little closer than friends.

00:36:34.543 --> 00:36:36.157
Family?

00:36:36.157 --> 00:36:38.436
I don't like that either.

00:36:39.759 --> 00:36:42.305
Forget it. Put me down.

00:36:42.305 --> 00:36:44.485
If we are not friends, why are you carrying me?

00:36:44.485 --> 00:36:46.818
Stay still. It is dangerous.

00:36:46.818 --> 00:36:49.341
No, just put me down!

00:36:49.341 --> 00:36:50.537
Fine.

00:36:50.537 --> 00:36:52.583
Okay. Friends.

00:36:53.251 --> 00:36:54.531
Really?

00:36:54.531 --> 00:36:56.791
Alright, Sun Tae Hyung.

00:36:57.553 --> 00:37:00.319
Let us drop the formalities too.

00:37:00.319 --> 00:37:02.870
Do whatever you want, Woo Hyun Jin.

00:37:05.484 --> 00:37:08.401
Make sure you eat properly.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:11.128
Okay.

00:37:12.002 --> 00:37:13.585
I wonder what Woo Joo is doing.

00:37:13.585 --> 00:37:15.141
I miss him.

00:37:15.141 --> 00:37:17.781
He is probably having fun.

00:37:17.781 --> 00:37:19.873
He is a bright kid. He will be fine anywhere.

00:37:19.873 --> 00:37:22.101
Woo Joo!

00:37:22.101 --> 00:37:25.094
Hyun Jin, are you okay?

00:37:25.094 --> 00:37:27.565
Yes. I am sorry for worrying you.

00:37:27.565 --> 00:37:30.211
Given how we look,

00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:33.064
I think we should head home.

00:37:35.282 --> 00:37:37.973
He passed out after drinking beer.

00:37:37.973 --> 00:37:40.308
Don't worry about us. We're really fine.

00:37:40.308 --> 00:37:42.047
How are you getting back at this hour?

00:37:42.047 --> 00:37:44.221
I called a taxi. You do not have to see us off.

00:37:44.221 --> 00:37:46.365
We had a great time today.

00:37:46.365 --> 00:37:47.659
Thank you.

00:37:47.659 --> 00:37:50.832
- Get home safe.
- Thank you.

00:37:56.139 --> 00:37:57.203
Hey, kid.

00:37:57.203 --> 00:37:59.182
Did you have fun today?

00:37:59.182 --> 00:38:00.654
Yeah.

00:38:00.654 --> 00:38:02.474
Look.

00:38:03.274 --> 00:38:05.300
What is that?

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:06.700
You know what?

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:09.260
A robot pops out from there.

00:38:10.097 --> 00:38:12.004
What do you think?

00:38:25.066 --> 00:38:27.983
Pat Bunny gently, like this.

00:38:27.983 --> 00:38:29.645
Tell him to go night-night.

00:38:29.645 --> 00:38:31.404
Isn't the night view pretty?

00:38:31.404 --> 00:38:33.477
- Pretty?
- Yeah.

00:38:36.745 --> 00:38:39.050
- Are you not sleepy?
- No.

00:38:43.501 --> 00:38:46.195
Wouldn't it be better if you rode on my back?

00:38:46.195 --> 00:38:47.662
Or should we go to the hospital?

00:38:47.662 --> 00:38:49.862
If we go now, it's a weekend night,

00:38:49.862 --> 00:38:52.840
so we'd have to go to the ER.

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.864
You really pinch every penny, don't you?

00:38:54.864 --> 00:38:57.638
I respect that, Ms. Hyun Jin.

00:38:57.638 --> 00:38:59.738
Hey, Sun Tae Hyung.

00:38:59.738 --> 00:39:01.683
We said we'd drop the formalities.

00:39:01.683 --> 00:39:04.352
Okay, Woo Hyun Jin.

00:39:04.352 --> 00:39:06.325
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:39:11.307 --> 00:39:13.808
I got worried when the call dropped.

00:39:13.808 --> 00:39:15.767
When I called back, your phone was off.

00:39:15.767 --> 00:39:17.394
I'm sorry.

00:39:17.394 --> 00:39:18.701
There was...

00:39:18.701 --> 00:39:20.832
kind of an incident.

00:39:20.832 --> 00:39:22.734
An incident?

00:39:26.274 --> 00:39:28.177
Well...

00:39:29.721 --> 00:39:31.861
You go inside first.

00:39:52.264 --> 00:39:53.864
If her phone was off,

00:39:53.864 --> 00:39:55.861
you could've just assumed it was charging.

00:39:55.861 --> 00:39:58.529
Why rush all the way to her place?

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:01.382
How romantic.

00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:11.143
What?

00:40:17.382 --> 00:40:20.047
Yoon Seong, I'm really fine.

00:40:20.047 --> 00:40:22.383
You said you rolled down a mountain.

00:40:22.383 --> 00:40:25.629
And it was raining.
If it gets infected, that's serious.

00:40:33.410 --> 00:40:35.551
[Emergency Medical Center]

00:40:45.489 --> 00:40:47.741
What did they say? Are you okay?

00:40:47.741 --> 00:40:49.363
Yeah.

00:40:49.363 --> 00:40:53.170
They said if I take the antibiotics
and apply the ointment, I'll be fine.

00:40:54.331 --> 00:40:55.376
You've taken me

00:40:55.376 --> 00:40:58.109
to the ER twice in just a few days.

00:40:58.109 --> 00:40:59.503
I know.

00:40:59.503 --> 00:41:01.185
Let's keep it at two.

00:41:01.185 --> 00:41:03.934
No third time.

00:41:03.934 --> 00:41:05.342
Of course.

00:41:05.342 --> 00:41:08.509
If you're grateful, let's grab a meal tomorrow.

00:41:08.509 --> 00:41:10.681
Sure.

00:41:10.681 --> 00:41:13.896
Then I'll treat you to something expensive.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:16.729
Oh, but

00:41:16.729 --> 00:41:19.982
I have Woo Joo on weekends.

00:41:19.982 --> 00:41:21.650
Perfect.

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:25.142
There's something I need to say
to that kid anyway.

00:41:27.077 --> 00:41:29.348
He's tiny but totally sharp.

00:41:29.348 --> 00:41:32.244
The way he got pouty
thinking I was taking his toy...

00:41:32.244 --> 00:41:33.370
So cute.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:34.538
Right?

00:41:34.538 --> 00:41:36.264
I'm not just saying that
because he's my nephew.

00:41:36.264 --> 00:41:37.630
He's seriously adorable.

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.735
Want to see pictures?

00:41:39.735 --> 00:41:41.646
Look.

00:41:41.646 --> 00:41:43.257
Isn't he the cutest?

00:41:43.257 --> 00:41:45.259
So lovely, right?

00:41:50.728 --> 00:41:52.982
Why are they taking so long?

00:41:54.138 --> 00:41:56.118
Are they dating?

00:41:57.334 --> 00:41:58.424
Well...

00:41:58.424 --> 00:42:00.857
What's it to me?

00:42:02.464 --> 00:42:04.358
I don't know.

00:42:18.374 --> 00:42:20.209
He cleaned the whole place himself.

00:42:20.209 --> 00:42:22.274
Must've been tough.

00:42:29.802 --> 00:42:31.428
I respect that, Ms. Hyun Jin.

00:42:31.428 --> 00:42:32.948
We said we'd drop the formalities.

00:42:32.948 --> 00:42:35.542
Okay, Woo Hyun Jin.

00:42:41.794 --> 00:42:44.175
Looks like they got close pretty fast.

00:43:27.067 --> 00:43:28.910
Look over here.

00:43:34.241 --> 00:43:36.334
Where are you going?

00:43:37.217 --> 00:43:39.936
You've been busy since this morning.

00:43:42.499 --> 00:43:46.136
I have a lunch meeting.

00:43:49.969 --> 00:43:52.028
With who?

00:43:52.618 --> 00:43:54.431
Yoon Seong.

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:57.723
He covered the ER bill yesterday,

00:43:57.723 --> 00:43:59.099
and the restaurant we're going to

00:43:59.099 --> 00:44:01.937
actually ties into a proposal I'm working on.

00:44:01.937 --> 00:44:04.037
So it kind of works out.

00:44:07.024 --> 00:44:10.282
Then why are you taking the baby?

00:44:10.282 --> 00:44:12.703
It's the weekend. It's my day with Woo Joo.

00:44:12.703 --> 00:44:15.047
So I thought I'd take him out.

00:44:22.206 --> 00:44:24.886
Go. He's probably waiting.

00:44:27.742 --> 00:44:29.682
Did you catch a cold?

00:44:29.682 --> 00:44:32.442
My throat's just scratchy. I just woke up.

00:44:33.592 --> 00:44:36.115
Oh no.

00:44:36.115 --> 00:44:39.508
It's probably from getting soaked yesterday.

00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:43.352
- Shouldn't you go to the hospital?
- I'm fine.

00:44:43.352 --> 00:44:45.284
Just go.

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.236
There's cold medicine in the first aid kit.

00:44:52.236 --> 00:44:55.313
- It's...
- I know where it is.

00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.973
Oh.

00:44:57.973 --> 00:45:00.123
Should I pick up cough syrup
and some herbal tonic on the way back?

00:45:00.123 --> 00:45:01.416
I said I'm fine.

00:45:01.416 --> 00:45:04.466
Just go. Are you leaving or not?

00:45:04.466 --> 00:45:06.378
Hey, kid.

00:45:07.918 --> 00:45:10.553
Okay, I'm going.

00:45:12.297 --> 00:45:14.270
Let's go.

00:45:16.427 --> 00:45:18.509
I'm going.

00:45:18.509 --> 00:45:20.356
Come on.

00:45:28.578 --> 00:45:31.403
I'll just have lunch and won't be late.

00:45:31.403 --> 00:45:32.651
If you feel worse, call me.

00:45:32.651 --> 00:45:34.445
I'll come right back.

00:45:34.445 --> 00:45:36.518
Okay?

00:45:46.874 --> 00:45:48.584
Let's go.

00:45:48.584 --> 00:45:50.534
Come on.

00:45:57.212 --> 00:45:59.011
You didn't have to come pick us up.

00:45:59.011 --> 00:46:00.993
How's your leg?

00:46:00.993 --> 00:46:04.141
It's a little better today.

00:46:04.141 --> 00:46:06.628
I've got something for you.

00:46:06.628 --> 00:46:08.528
For me?

00:46:14.443 --> 00:46:17.946
Sorry. Not for you.

00:46:17.946 --> 00:46:19.512
Hi there.

00:46:19.512 --> 00:46:21.038
Let's have fun today.

00:46:21.038 --> 00:46:22.950
Here.

00:46:33.504 --> 00:46:34.797
Did you...

00:46:34.797 --> 00:46:37.257
buy a car seat?

00:46:37.257 --> 00:46:39.783
No, I borrowed it.

00:46:41.386 --> 00:46:43.177
How old is Woo Joo?

00:46:43.177 --> 00:46:45.494
Twenty-one months.

00:46:46.266 --> 00:46:48.633
He doesn't seem shy.

00:46:48.633 --> 00:46:50.644
I figured I'd skip the stiff suit

00:46:50.644 --> 00:46:53.457
and dress a little more casual today.

00:46:53.457 --> 00:46:55.984
Oh, I see.

00:46:55.984 --> 00:46:59.905
You look like you did in college.

00:46:59.905 --> 00:47:02.647
You were really popular back then.

00:47:03.984 --> 00:47:07.137
What's that smile? Like you already knew?

00:47:07.137 --> 00:47:08.372
Did you know?

00:47:08.372 --> 00:47:11.066
Well, my locker was packed

00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:14.152
every Valentine's Day.

00:47:14.152 --> 00:47:15.796
Beats me.

00:47:15.796 --> 00:47:16.964
Right.

00:47:16.964 --> 00:47:18.966
You were always like this.

00:47:18.966 --> 00:47:20.843
What, you thought I'd changed

00:47:20.843 --> 00:47:22.261
after seven years?

00:47:22.261 --> 00:47:23.387
Yes.

00:47:23.387 --> 00:47:27.295
I thought you'd turned into
some strict manager.

00:47:27.295 --> 00:47:29.489
What's that supposed to mean?

00:47:29.489 --> 00:47:30.602
You know,

00:47:30.602 --> 00:47:32.387
all mature and responsible.

00:47:32.387 --> 00:47:35.367
Like a real team leader.

00:47:44.825 --> 00:47:46.201
For the abalone porridge,

00:47:46.201 --> 00:47:47.903
please keep it unseasoned for the baby.

00:47:47.903 --> 00:47:49.555
As we discussed yesterday,

00:47:49.555 --> 00:47:53.681
we'll also prepare seaweed soup
and steamed pumpkin for children.

00:47:54.293 --> 00:47:55.417
Did you

00:47:55.417 --> 00:47:57.361
make a special reservation

00:47:57.361 --> 00:47:58.808
because of me?

00:47:58.808 --> 00:48:00.591
Didn't I tell you?

00:48:00.591 --> 00:48:03.193
I know the chef here.

00:48:03.193 --> 00:48:05.095
When I said I was coming with a baby,

00:48:05.095 --> 00:48:07.548
he offered to take care of it.

00:48:13.395 --> 00:48:14.693
Try it.

00:48:14.693 --> 00:48:17.471
It'll help with the concept direction

00:48:17.471 --> 00:48:20.504
and menu planning for your proposal.

00:48:23.071 --> 00:48:25.240
What?

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.524
Does this still bring back memories?

00:48:27.524 --> 00:48:29.453
Of cafeteria days?

00:48:29.453 --> 00:48:30.996
Not really.

00:48:30.996 --> 00:48:34.249
They didn't serve fish much in the cafeteria.

00:48:34.249 --> 00:48:36.179
Didn't they?

00:48:43.011 --> 00:48:44.068
Is it good?

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.503
That's a relief.

00:48:58.315 --> 00:49:00.199
Thank you.

00:49:15.165 --> 00:49:17.175
- Good?
- Yeah.

00:49:18.072 --> 00:49:20.165
You're eating so well.

00:49:26.093 --> 00:49:29.187
I don't know. It feels a little strange.

00:49:30.514 --> 00:49:33.141
Seven years really is a long time.

00:49:33.141 --> 00:49:35.555
You said you're the same, but...

00:49:35.555 --> 00:49:39.631
I feel like there's so much about you
I didn't know.

00:49:39.631 --> 00:49:42.132
It feels a little unfamiliar.

00:49:42.132 --> 00:49:44.417
Not in a bad way.

00:49:44.417 --> 00:49:47.166
I just want to get close to you again.

00:49:47.166 --> 00:49:49.450
Like before.

00:49:52.870 --> 00:49:55.006
If you keep looking that awkward,

00:49:55.006 --> 00:49:57.487
the team's going to think I yelled at you.

00:49:57.487 --> 00:50:00.145
They'll think I'm a strict manager.

00:50:01.227 --> 00:50:02.813
Was it that obvious?

00:50:04.030 --> 00:50:06.883
You've never been good at hiding
your expressions.

00:50:06.883 --> 00:50:09.134
You're even more transparent than the baby.

00:50:09.134 --> 00:50:10.947
Right? Woo Joo.

00:50:12.649 --> 00:50:14.307
Hey.

00:50:14.307 --> 00:50:15.809
He's really smart, isn't he?

00:50:15.809 --> 00:50:17.689
He is, right?

00:50:17.689 --> 00:50:19.758
I'm telling you, he really is.

00:50:19.758 --> 00:50:22.639
I'm smart.

00:50:22.639 --> 00:50:24.030
Finish what's in your mouth first.

00:50:24.030 --> 00:50:26.557
I'm smart.

00:50:26.557 --> 00:50:28.490
Good?

00:51:08.570 --> 00:51:10.783
What's taking so long?

00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:19.456
Uncle, this is Bom.

00:51:19.456 --> 00:51:23.896
I'm sending you the family photos
from yesterday.

00:51:38.266 --> 00:51:40.644
But the lens doesn't lie.

00:51:40.644 --> 00:51:42.317
The way you look at someone.

00:51:42.317 --> 00:51:44.251
The heart you put into the shot.

00:51:44.251 --> 00:51:46.998
You don't get moments like that
without affection.

00:51:46.998 --> 00:51:49.942
In the end, the camera reflects your heart.

00:52:15.257 --> 00:52:17.396
I'll come get you.

00:52:18.223 --> 00:52:21.275
Sometimes I'll come meet you.

00:52:21.935 --> 00:52:23.834
So if there's a day

00:52:23.834 --> 00:52:27.542
when you're stuck in the rain
without an umbrella,

00:52:27.542 --> 00:52:29.635
just call me.

00:52:30.448 --> 00:52:33.913
I'll be your umbrella.

00:53:01.816 --> 00:53:06.570
[Temporary Housing]

00:53:17.029 --> 00:53:19.391
Just a moment.

00:53:19.391 --> 00:53:21.926
The person you're calling is not answering...

00:53:21.926 --> 00:53:23.497
[Temporary Helper]

00:53:23.497 --> 00:53:25.628
Why isn't he picking up?

00:53:25.628 --> 00:53:28.973
[Have you eaten something?
Shall I get you something? ]

00:53:33.886 --> 00:53:38.506
[Great dessert cafes to visit with a baby]

00:53:46.217 --> 00:53:47.567
He really looks like you.

00:53:47.567 --> 00:53:49.581
Those big round eyes.

00:53:49.581 --> 00:53:52.215
Were you this cute as a kid?

00:53:52.215 --> 00:53:53.276
Come on.

00:53:53.276 --> 00:53:55.876
Who wasn't cute as a baby?

00:53:57.206 --> 00:53:58.482
I was pretty handsome,

00:53:58.482 --> 00:54:00.919
even back then.

00:54:03.078 --> 00:54:05.209
But being here today,

00:54:05.209 --> 00:54:06.898
I think I'm starting to see

00:54:06.898 --> 00:54:09.709
how to connect the concept direction
with the story.

00:54:09.709 --> 00:54:12.146
If you need to,
check out our past campaign cases.

00:54:13.286 --> 00:54:14.798
This quarter's lineup,

00:54:14.798 --> 00:54:18.385
dessert's going to be the key element
that sets the whole branding mood.

00:54:18.385 --> 00:54:21.859
There's a great dessert cafe nearby.

00:54:21.859 --> 00:54:23.965
Want to stop by?

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:28.394
Why?

00:54:28.394 --> 00:54:30.543
You don't want to?

00:54:31.898 --> 00:54:34.058
Is something wrong?

00:54:36.265 --> 00:54:38.071
It's just...

00:54:38.071 --> 00:54:40.691
My in-law didn't look well earlier.

00:54:40.691 --> 00:54:42.724
I'm worried about him.

00:54:55.718 --> 00:54:58.800
Tae Hyung must've been sick last night.

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.433
He didn't say anything.
He probably just toughed it out.

00:55:02.433 --> 00:55:05.393
It's the rain.

00:55:05.393 --> 00:55:06.711
He always gets sick

00:55:06.711 --> 00:55:09.555
when it rains.

00:55:09.555 --> 00:55:11.515
Maybe it's because no matter how long he waits,

00:55:11.515 --> 00:55:14.881
the person he's waiting for never shows up.

00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:18.061
And he's left feeling alone.

00:56:30.382 --> 00:56:32.721
Are you okay?

00:56:33.591 --> 00:56:37.417
Your fever went up to
39 degrees Celsius overnight.

00:56:46.074 --> 00:56:50.140
I was this close to calling an ambulance.

00:56:54.999 --> 00:56:56.501
Still sick?

00:56:56.501 --> 00:56:59.286
Do you want to go to the hospital?

00:57:04.083 --> 00:57:06.781
Why were you so late?

00:57:10.767 --> 00:57:13.023
You know I hate

00:57:13.023 --> 00:57:15.396
waiting for someone.

00:57:19.149 --> 00:57:21.262
Sun Tae Hyung...

00:57:23.533 --> 00:57:25.663
I like you.

00:57:29.507 --> 00:57:31.787
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:57:38.456 --> 00:57:41.829
That's why I keep finding myself
waiting for you.

00:58:44.739 --> 00:58:46.337
Oh my God, what is this?

00:58:46.337 --> 00:58:48.327
Why are you two moving so fast?

00:58:48.327 --> 00:58:50.304
This is way more awkward than I expected.

00:58:50.304 --> 00:58:51.730
Did something go on between you two?

00:58:51.730 --> 00:58:55.597
No, it is not like that at all.

00:58:55.597 --> 00:58:57.193
Honestly, I was worried about you.

00:58:57.193 --> 00:58:59.208
Living with a guy like that.

00:58:59.208 --> 00:59:00.479
Oh, it is Lobby Guy!

00:59:00.479 --> 00:59:01.846
The lobby nuisance guy!

00:59:01.846 --> 00:59:03.327
Why? What happened?

00:59:03.327 --> 00:59:05.984
Woo Joo, have fun with your friends.

00:59:05.984 --> 00:59:07.102
I will come get you.

00:59:07.102 --> 00:59:10.301
They say some suspicious guy in a hat
has been hanging around at night.

00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:12.301
Woo Hyun Jin.
