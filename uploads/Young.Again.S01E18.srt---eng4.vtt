WEBVTT

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.299
Go to the station in a bit

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.700
to pick up your Brother Maomao.

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:57.980
What era is this?

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.180
There's GPS and ride-hailing apps.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.040
Is a station pickup really necessary?

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.340
Honestly.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.180
What if my nephew

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.819
loses his phone? What then?

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.420
Is he your biological sister's son?

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:06.939
Not biological.

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.020
Just a cousin...

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.819
Cousin.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.620
I call her Cousin-aunt.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.060
Cousin-aunt's son.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.319
We're barely even related.

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.020
Sister Jiajia,

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.139
but this is your cousin!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.379
Cousins meeting for the first time...

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:19.939
Isn't that just like

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:21.819
the first meeting of Bao and Dai in *Dream of the Red Chamber*?

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.860
What "first meeting of Bao and Dai"?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.259
We met when we were kids.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:27.900
I guess he was seven and I was five back then.

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:29.900
Good lord, that's even better, sister.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.939
Childhood sweethearts.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.280
His name is Maomao, right?

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.639
Yes.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.919
Your cousin-uncle lives here.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.759
Uncle!

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.520
Hello there!

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.120
You've grown so tall!

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.719
Come on,

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:43.680
I've been this tall for over twenty years.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.560
You're here, why did you bring gifts?

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.120
I brought you some...

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.800
these are morel mushrooms.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.199
Alright.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.180
Come here.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.719
Do you still recognize her?

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.560
My little sister, Jiajia.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.240
Right.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.479
We've met before, remember?

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.340
You're different from when you were little.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.439
You're different too.

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.199
Different how?

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.360
Compared to when you were little...

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.099
You're prettier.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:12.500
Brother Maomao

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:13.740
Since you're here this time...

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.300
Have you arranged a hotel?

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.780
I was looking online...

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.259
If you don't mind...

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:18.659
You can stay at home.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.139
Is that okay?

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:23.379
Would our brother-in-law be happy?

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:24.460
What brother-in-law?

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.219
Divorced.

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:26.979
That's great.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.580
No...

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:29.900
I mean...

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.379
That wasn't a good match.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.180
You had to divorce.

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:34.560
I've been divorced for a few years too.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.219
That's wonderful.

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:38.939
What kind of talk is that?

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:39.860
Saying divorce is good.

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:41.819
No, Uncle.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.219
We fought every day.

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.699
What else could we do but divorce?

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:47.500
If my ex-wife was half as good as our Jiajia...

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.460
I wouldn't have divorced.

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:51.979
Cousin, look at what you're saying.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.139
Maomao

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:56.379
We've been so busy talking.

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:57.539
I haven't asked about your mom.

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.300
How is she doing now?

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:00.620
Is her health okay?

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.939
You two are young.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.699
You didn't see my style when I was young.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.020
Definitely more handsome than this Maomao.

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:09.740
Back in college...

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.979
The girls in our class...

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.060
Even the Class Belle...

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.580
Department Belle...

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.180
Chased me for over three years.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.459
Then why didn't you two get together?

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.939
I rejected her, of course.

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:23.259
Regret it?

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.259
No need to regret.

00:04:25.579 --> 00:04:27.220
What Department Belle, coarse belle.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.139
She's an old lady by now.

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:30.779
The day after tomorrow...

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:32.500
Is our Class of '77...

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.220
First reunion since graduation.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.180
I really want to see...

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.019
What she looks like as an old lady.

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.779
If that old lady...

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:40.379
No...

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.100
I mean that old Department Belle.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.220
If she chases you again...

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.660
Will you agree this time?

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:47.579
Shoo.

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:50.019
This kid is even more of a gossip than me.

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:51.699
How do you know...

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.699
That old Department Belle doesn't have a husband at home?

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.180
Having a husband doesn't stop her from chasing, Auntie Cai.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.480
Don't.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.439
Don't talk nonsense.

00:04:58.899 --> 00:05:01.139
I've already found out from classmates.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.899
Widowed.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:06.579
You're so invested.

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.699
Can't get that old lady out of your mind.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.740
Means you've got intentions.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:14.379
Dad.

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.879
What's wrong?

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:15.879
Dad, what's wrong with you?

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:16.560
What do we do?

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.279
Dad.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.180
Dr. Sun, do we need to go to the hospital?

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.019
My dad has never fainted before.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.459
It's not serious.

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.420
He just suffered a sudden, intense shock.

00:05:26.579 --> 00:05:27.779
He'll be fine after a few days of rest.

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:28.699
Jiajia.

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:31.019
What shock did your dad get to end up like this?

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.699
Yeah.

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.740
He didn't get any shock.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.420
We were just chatting here.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.819
Speaking of which, my brother's mom passed away.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.939
What happened?

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.480
Help him up, rub his back.

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.720
Easy now.

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.860
That's a deep bond between siblings.

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.339
When my mom passed away...

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.459
What's going on?

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:54.939
...she kept talking about my uncle.

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:56.699
She also said...

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.500
...for me to personally...

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.540
...take a floral towel...

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:02.939
...and put it in my uncle's hands.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.860
Where is it?

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:04.519
Mao...

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.459
Mao...

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.980
Uncle.

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:06.459
I...

00:06:06.459 --> 00:06:06.980
Mao...

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:07.500
I'm here.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.259
I'm here, Uncle.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.300
Where is the towel?

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:11.339
The towel.

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:12.339
Got it.

00:06:12.459 --> 00:06:12.980
It's here.

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.060
Don't get agitated, Dad.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.379
Take your time and tell us.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.240
It's so cool.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:25.240
Cool?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.060
It's not chilly today.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.639
I don't mean the weather is cool.

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.000
I mean you are very stylish.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.279
It means following the trend.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.839
Drop-dead handsome and super cool.

00:06:34.839 --> 00:06:36.519
Simply irresistible.

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.040
You call this fashionable?

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:39.959
Old school classy.

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:41.439
Just an old gentleman.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:44.959
Why are you dressed so gentlemanly today?

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.079
I'm going to a class reunion today.

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:47.879
Asking what you already know.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.180
I know.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.199
Just to make...

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.439
...Grandma Department Belle's eyes light up.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.439
Grandpa Li, are you feeling any better?

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:02.920
I'm done for.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.839
Dad, what nonsense are you talking?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.160
Old Li.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.600
Pull yourself together.

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.120
Don't be so dispirited.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.920
Life still has many wonderful things.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.120
Take me for example.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.079
Tonight...

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.680
...I will...

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.000
...with the Department Belle classmate I haven't seen in over 40 years...

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.040
...have a long-awaited reunion.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.319
Aren't you happy for me?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.800
Bless you, Old Fan.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:29.360
I hope you and the Department Belle get back together.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:32.839
And renew your past romance.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.680
Don't leave any regrets.

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:39.199
I...

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.319
...will never have the chance again.

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.259
No...

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:56.360
Jiajia.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.259
What?

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.920
Thanks, Brother Maomao.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:03.560
Brother Maomao.

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:05.920
So how many days can you stay this time?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.720
I'm done with my business.

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.120
I can leave anytime.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.040
But I...

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.399
For...

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.480
...I'll just stay a few more days.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:16.759
For what?

00:08:17.439 --> 00:08:18.439
What am I doing it for?

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:20.519
You don't know?

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.000
It would be great if you didn't leave.

00:08:34.679 --> 00:08:35.480
No,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.519
Brother Maomao,

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.600
neither of us are kids anymore.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.360
We've both had unfortunate pasts.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.159
So stop holding back.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.919
No,

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.360
Sis, I'm not holding back.

00:08:44.879 --> 00:08:45.679
I...

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:47.840
Actually,

00:08:48.279 --> 00:08:50.799
when I arrived yesterday and saw you,

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.320
I just...

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.480
I was thinking the exact same thing as you.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.759
Then that's settled.

00:08:55.759 --> 00:08:56.480
But...

00:08:56.559 --> 00:08:58.679
but just now, I suddenly had a thought.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.279
I felt like...

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:02.159
this feeling of closeness between us...

00:09:03.639 --> 00:09:05.120
what if it isn't love?

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:08.559
Wait,

00:09:08.559 --> 00:09:09.200
love?

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.039
No,

00:09:10.039 --> 00:09:11.120
what do you mean?

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.279
Sit down.

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:16.559
Don't you think

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:18.519
my Uncle

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.200
is acting a bit strange?

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.720
How so?

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.039
Why do I sound like you now?

00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:26.600
Think about it.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.240
My mom

00:09:29.039 --> 00:09:30.360
was just one of his

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:30.960
distant...

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.559
distant cousins.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.639
When my Uncle heard my mom passed away,

00:09:37.879 --> 00:09:39.039
why would he have

00:09:39.159 --> 00:09:40.600
such a huge reaction?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.919
Yeah, I was wondering that too.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.799
When my mom passed away back then,

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.580
I don't think he was even that grief-stricken.

00:09:46.639 --> 00:09:47.059
Also,

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:49.200
my mom...

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.639
on her deathbed,

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:53.440
holding that towel in her hand,

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.200
she gasped and told me,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.379
"Once I'm gone,

00:10:02.279 --> 00:10:05.120
you must treat your cousin well.

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.600
And your Uncle...

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.000
they are your closest family."

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.440
Think about it.

00:10:13.039 --> 00:10:14.039
What does that mean?

00:10:16.279 --> 00:10:17.679
Now I'm thinking,

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.919
is there another possibility?

00:10:22.279 --> 00:10:23.320
That you and I

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.279
are actually direct blood relatives?

00:10:36.299 --> 00:10:37.179
Professor Fan

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.820
Auntie Cai told us everything

00:10:41.539 --> 00:10:43.379
About your date with that first love

00:10:43.899 --> 00:10:44.940
How was it?

00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:45.860
Yeah

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.059
Tell us about it, quick

00:10:47.059 --> 00:10:49.100
Did you rekindle the old flame with that Department Belle?

00:10:49.539 --> 00:10:50.139
Did you meet?

00:10:50.139 --> 00:10:51.019
We did meet

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.779
And it felt pretty good

00:10:53.139 --> 00:10:54.299
As for the old flame...

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:55.620
We didn't rekindle it

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:57.899
Isn't that a waste of time?

00:10:57.899 --> 00:10:59.100
That's actually pretty good

00:10:59.139 --> 00:11:00.179
It's been over forty years

00:11:00.179 --> 00:11:01.179
And it still felt good

00:11:01.179 --> 00:11:02.379
That's quite rare

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.419
You don't find guys like that nowadays

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:06.220
What's wrong with guys nowadays?

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:07.820
That is naked prejudice

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:09.700
Alright

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.159
No

00:11:10.419 --> 00:11:10.779
So...

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.220
What happens next?

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.779
What else can happen?

00:11:13.779 --> 00:11:14.419
She was just...

00:11:14.419 --> 00:11:16.419
Chatting with me politely

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:17.740
When I brought up the past

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:19.940
She said she didn't remember anything

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.659
Our Professor Fan is such an excellent man

00:11:22.659 --> 00:11:24.100
And he got the cold shoulder from her

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.220
No

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.139
Then I think this old Department Belle

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:28.860
Is a bit too full of herself

00:11:29.139 --> 00:11:31.100
After all, so many years have passed

00:11:31.779 --> 00:11:35.159
"Fallen flowers, flowing water, spring is gone"

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:36.080
Exactly

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.500
There are plenty more fish in the sea

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.940
So many people have their eyes on our Professor Fan

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:40.860
However... However

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.259
She said she's coming to see me tomorrow

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:44.860
Asked me to send her my location

00:11:47.299 --> 00:11:48.539
Seize the opportunity

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.179
Don't leave any regrets

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:52.620
Dad

00:11:53.019 --> 00:11:53.940
The two of us

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:56.820
Have something to ask you

00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:02.700
Answer truthfully.

00:12:03.059 --> 00:12:04.620
Are you and my Cousin-aunt...

00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:06.340
It's no big deal.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.059
Uncle.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.139
We're just chatting casually.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.019
Right.

00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:13.779
We just want to know.

00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:15.659
You and my Mom.

00:12:17.659 --> 00:12:18.419
Yeah, Dad.

00:12:18.419 --> 00:12:20.299
Just tell us the honest truth.

00:12:20.299 --> 00:12:21.820
Meaning, you and my Cousin-aunt...

00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:25.379
Have some unspeakable relationship?

00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:27.659
I won't take it to heart.

00:12:27.659 --> 00:12:28.299
Right.

00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:32.019
Since we're at this point...

00:12:34.059 --> 00:12:35.980
I'll tell you the truth.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.899
So there really is something!

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.980
I won't hide the truth from you.

00:12:42.659 --> 00:12:43.460
Maomao.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:45.220
You actually...

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.100
Don't know your mother.

00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:50.480
You scared me to death.

00:12:51.179 --> 00:12:52.700
In your eyes...

00:12:54.019 --> 00:12:56.580
Your mother works hard all day.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.200
Nagging all the time.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.039
Old and faded.

00:13:02.179 --> 00:13:03.779
Sloppy and unkempt.

00:13:05.779 --> 00:13:07.500
But you don't know...

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.899
Back then, for miles around...

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.580
Your mother was a famous beauty.

00:13:17.299 --> 00:13:19.539
With big eyes...

00:13:21.059 --> 00:13:23.059
And braids thick and long.

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:26.340
My cousin and I...

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.460
Just like in that song.

00:13:30.299 --> 00:13:30.980
Thank you...

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:31.799
Uncle.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.600
You just...

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:34.860
Say it.

00:13:35.159 --> 00:13:36.100
No need to sing.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:36.940
All right.

00:13:37.159 --> 00:13:37.740
Wait, Dad.

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:39.419
So you and Cousin-aunt really were...

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:42.379
In that kind of relationship?

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.740
I must admit.

00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.019
In those days...

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.860
In that environment...

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:52.340
At that age...

00:13:55.019 --> 00:13:55.820
Indeed...

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.779
Definitely...

00:14:00.179 --> 00:14:01.179
Truly...

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.940
It was something like that.

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:05.539
What do you mean "like that"?

00:14:07.139 --> 00:14:08.940
Our division's propaganda team...

00:14:09.179 --> 00:14:11.139
Wasn't far from your Beiyin Tun.

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:14.740
Your mother often came to visit me.

00:14:15.059 --> 00:14:15.860
And I...

00:14:16.059 --> 00:14:17.899
Often popped over to your house.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:19.980
To eat.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.220
To get a good meal.

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:23.820
To have a treat.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:27.820
Your mom's sticky bean buns...

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:30.379
That stewed carp...

00:14:31.059 --> 00:14:33.220
And those pickled cabbage dumplings...

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.620
They were incredibly delicious.

00:14:36.059 --> 00:14:39.460
A taste I'll never forget.

00:14:42.899 --> 00:14:43.940
Once,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.299
I had a fever.

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.220
It was over 40 degrees.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.460
I was burning up so bad I convulsed.

00:14:52.139 --> 00:14:53.659
As the saying goes,

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:55.419
"Infantile convulsions,

00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.340
a narrow escape from death."

00:14:57.779 --> 00:14:59.299
Of course, I wasn't an infant.

00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:00.179
Right.

00:15:01.139 --> 00:15:03.700
It was all thanks to your Cousin-aunt caring for me.

00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:08.059
We were together day and night for three days.

00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.700
She pulled me back from death's door.

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:13.419
Together day and night?

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:15.179
For three days and three nights?

00:15:15.179 --> 00:15:16.299
Yeah, Dad.

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:18.139
Three days and nights, you and Cousin-aunt...

00:15:19.779 --> 00:15:20.700
what did you do?

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:23.100
What else could we do?

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:24.779
I was having convulsions!

00:15:27.139 --> 00:15:30.220
My cousin took meticulous care of me.

00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:31.779
She brewed medicine for me,

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.019
gave me acupuncture,

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.059
rubbed alcohol on my chest,

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.460
and rubbed my back.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:42.340
Your mom was

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.419
a self-taught barefoot doctor.

00:15:45.059 --> 00:15:47.940
One silver needle cured a hundred diseases.

00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:51.179
Praised by all the poor and lower-middle peasants.

00:15:51.299 --> 00:15:53.580
Later, they said she was practicing without a license

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.700
and made her stop.

00:15:55.299 --> 00:15:56.539
What a pity.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.500
But she saved my life!

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:01.700
Later on,

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:05.019
before I returned to division headquarters,

00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:09.740
your Cousin-aunt gave me this towel.

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:12.139
She was afraid I'd catch a cold,

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.539
so she wrapped it around my head.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:16.860
I wore this headscarf

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.179
and fought heaven and earth with full vigor.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:21.539
Uncle.

00:16:22.059 --> 00:16:22.860
What happened next?

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:23.379
What happened next?

00:16:23.379 --> 00:16:24.100
Later...

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:25.740
Later on,

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.700
I returned to division headquarters,

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.440
and the division

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.500
recommended me to Chaoyang Agricultural College.

00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:32.639
That was...

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.779
do you remember what year that was?

00:16:35.779 --> 00:16:37.179
I'll never forget it.

00:16:37.659 --> 00:16:40.500
The earth-shaking year of 1976.

00:16:41.419 --> 00:16:42.500
1976, right?

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.820
The night before returning to the city,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.419
my cousin and I went to the riverside.

00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.659
In that patch of

00:16:55.659 --> 00:16:57.019
small woods we planted ourselves,

00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.580
the two of us...

00:17:00.259 --> 00:17:02.379
just talked all night.

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:07.660
I gave this towel as a token

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:09.859
to my cousin.

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:11.900
I told her,

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.500
I'd come back for her after graduation.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.059
But in October of that year,

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.460
she married my dad.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:19.420
After the Spring Festival the next year,

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:21.299
I was born.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:23.579
Dad.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:24.579
Just tell us straight,

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.299
did you and Cousin-aunt ever...

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:29.700
We're chatting here.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:32.779
Just now,

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.660
Jiajia said she had something to tell your dad.

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:36.900
I figured,

00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:38.220
nine times out of ten,

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:40.180
you two want to get together.

00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:40.900
Right?

00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:45.980
Do you two really mean that?

00:17:46.819 --> 00:17:47.759
Don't listen to Auntie Cai's nonsense.

00:17:47.759 --> 00:17:49.460
Yes.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:50.579
That's right.

00:17:50.579 --> 00:17:51.140
Dad,

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.779
we just want to get together.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.099
What do you think?

00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.339
My sharp eyes, good lord!

00:17:57.339 --> 00:17:59.180
See how accurate I am, right?

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.500
How could your dad disagree with such good news?

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:03.779
A talented man and a beautiful woman,

00:18:03.779 --> 00:18:04.980
making the family ties even closer.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:07.660
Auntie Cai is the first to raise both hands in approval.

00:18:08.299 --> 00:18:09.099
Uncle,

00:18:09.819 --> 00:18:11.059
what's your opinion?

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:12.900
Why still call me Uncle?

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.859
Just call me Dad directly.

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:19.220
You really should call me Dad.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.619
What are you gasping at?

00:18:21.619 --> 00:18:22.700
If you marry Jiajia,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:24.220
wouldn't you call him Dad?

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:41.940
Your community is really beautiful

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.500
This lake...

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.019
This tree...

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:47.140
And that little stone boat...

00:18:48.019 --> 00:18:50.180
It looks just like the Nameless Lake at our school.

00:18:50.539 --> 00:18:52.220
Yes, back then...

00:18:52.259 --> 00:18:53.599
We used to be by the lakeside often...

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:54.500
Reading...

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:56.180
Discussing, memorizing vocabulary...

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:59.099
Yes, we often took walks by the lake.

00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.539
You still remember?

00:19:01.299 --> 00:19:02.740
How could I forget?

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.220
Even now...

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:06.900
I often dream of that place back then.

00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:07.819
I thought...

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:09.039
You had forgotten everything.

00:19:09.819 --> 00:19:11.180
How is that possible?

00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:12.539
Not only have I not forgotten,

00:19:12.539 --> 00:19:13.259
But also...

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:15.440
You often appear in my dreams too.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:17.940
Really?

00:19:18.539 --> 00:19:19.859
Of course it's true.

00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:22.180
Otherwise, with so many boys chasing me...

00:19:22.339 --> 00:19:23.980
Why would I insist on being with you?

00:19:24.259 --> 00:19:25.900
Doesn't that explain everything?

00:19:27.299 --> 00:19:28.099
Then...

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:29.460
After graduation...

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:31.579
Why did you leave me again?

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.660
Dacheng, come, sit down.

00:19:34.859 --> 00:19:36.099
Actually, for all these years...

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:38.059
I've always wanted to explain to you.

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.759
But I never had the chance.

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:41.779
Chatting, are we?

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.180
This must be that Department Belle sister.

00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:49.539
You look so pretty.

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.660
You're two years older than me, right?

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.539
But you look just like my eldest niece!

00:19:54.859 --> 00:19:56.460
This sister really knows how to talk.

00:19:56.799 --> 00:19:57.240
Come...

00:19:57.339 --> 00:19:58.500
Let me introduce myself.

00:19:58.819 --> 00:19:59.420
I am...

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.019
Professor Fan's neighbor.

00:20:01.059 --> 00:20:03.500
I often hear him talk about you.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.579
Saying how wonderful you are...

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:08.019
And how compatible the two of you are.

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:09.740
He said your husband passed away...

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:10.980
That's great!

00:20:11.779 --> 00:20:13.779
I mean, what I'm trying to say is...

00:20:14.339 --> 00:20:16.539
You and Professor Fan, on the journey of life...

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:18.180
Have met again.

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.980
Why not join forces for a better life?

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.859
Why don't you just...

00:20:21.859 --> 00:20:22.700
Just... Auntie Cai!

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.579
Why don't you go cool off somewhere else?

00:20:24.579 --> 00:20:26.220
Didn't Professor Fan ask me...

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.559
To set the two of you up?

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:28.619
When did I ever...

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:29.720
Just go, quickly.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.259
Go on.

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.859
That Little Cai...

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.579
She's just a warm-hearted person.

00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:40.779
Well...

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:42.819
Jing Xian.

00:20:42.859 --> 00:20:44.299
Don't take it to heart.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:45.940
How could I?

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.339
Who knows, maybe what she said...

00:20:47.339 --> 00:20:48.900
...is exactly what's in my heart.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.500
Jing Xian.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.339
Is that really how you feel?

00:20:58.819 --> 00:20:59.400
What's wrong?

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:00.720
Nothing.

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:01.940
I was afraid I was dreaming,

00:21:02.059 --> 00:21:03.220
so I pinched my thigh.

00:21:06.299 --> 00:21:06.980
It's just that...

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:09.700
I'm troubled by something every day right now,

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:11.259
and I simply don't have time to consider...

00:21:11.259 --> 00:21:12.640
...the matters between us.

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.099
What is it?

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.740
Xian.

00:21:16.339 --> 00:21:17.420
Can I help?

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:20.339
You can definitely help with this.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:22.740
You know my granddaughter, Wu Aijia.

00:21:23.099 --> 00:21:25.619
Her candidate number is 916077.

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:27.619
She is currently applying for...

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:30.180
...a master's degree at Huaguang Management College.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.819
Right now, she's stuck at...

00:21:31.819 --> 00:21:33.240
...the interview stage.

00:21:35.059 --> 00:21:35.859
Well...

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.819
I've looked into it.

00:21:38.019 --> 00:21:40.420
You know the dean and the examiners very well.

00:21:40.660 --> 00:21:42.259
They are either your old friends...

00:21:42.259 --> 00:21:43.660
...or your former students.

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:45.819
If you just send them a WeChat message,

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:47.859
you could change my granddaughter's life.

00:21:50.339 --> 00:21:52.059
At our age...

00:21:52.339 --> 00:21:53.460
...the children's affairs...

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.640
...are more important than our own.

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:56.900
You understand, right?

00:21:58.539 --> 00:21:59.980
I cannot understand.

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:02.019
That is your child.

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:03.339
Not my child.

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.059
How can you say that?

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:10.019
Later on...

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.900
...when we become a family...

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:12.700
Jiajia...

00:22:12.859 --> 00:22:14.779
...will be a child to both of us.

00:22:16.059 --> 00:22:17.720
But no matter whose child it is...

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.900
...once I do this...

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.259
...the one getting hurt...

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.059
...will be someone else's child.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.539
Jing Xian.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.339
It seems that becoming a family...

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:29.640
...will be quite difficult.

00:22:30.619 --> 00:22:31.420
This time...

00:22:31.619 --> 00:22:33.299
...you deigning to visit me at the nursing home...

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.859
...wasn't actually because of any lingering feelings.

00:22:35.859 --> 00:22:36.579
Right?

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:38.859
Those things you just said...

00:22:40.259 --> 00:22:41.539
...were actually all because...

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.539
...the child's matters are more important than anything.

00:22:44.819 --> 00:22:45.500
Right?

00:22:53.339 --> 00:22:55.700
It seems you won't help with this.

00:22:57.619 --> 00:22:59.099
Do you want to reconsider?

00:22:59.539 --> 00:23:00.339
No need.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.059
Thank you very much...

00:23:03.119 --> 00:23:04.180
...for coming to see me.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:06.500
Making this life of mine...

00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:08.099
...free of regrets.

00:23:10.819 --> 00:23:12.539
It seems you haven't changed a bit.

00:23:14.299 --> 00:23:15.140
I'm leaving then.

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.619
Goodbye.

00:23:32.019 --> 00:23:32.940
Professor Fan

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.480
I admire him.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.319
Uncle said

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:41.960
we're just ordinary siblings.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.299
But he also admitted

00:23:43.299 --> 00:23:44.799
it's not a normal relationship.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:47.799
But he keeps denying there's proof.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:50.160
But the timing in the woods matches.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.660
It's not about our relationship,

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.240
he didn't fiercely oppose it either.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.440
Simply put,

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:55.480
just let Dad...

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.680
you and your Uncle...

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.319
go do a paternity test.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.079
Then we'll know everything.

00:24:01.079 --> 00:24:02.559
Would my Uncle agree?

00:24:02.839 --> 00:24:03.960
Besides,

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:05.720
what if

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.079
Uncle turns out to be my real dad?

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:10.880
What about the one back home?

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.960
Call him Uncle?

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:13.680
Would that work?

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.519
No matter what,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.559
he's the dad who raised me.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.480
True.

00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:22.039
In that case,

00:24:22.359 --> 00:24:24.519
we really won't have a chance.

00:24:27.279 --> 00:24:28.079
Sis,

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:30.559
how about

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.880
we both cool off for a bit.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.759
Brother Maomao,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.599
now that you're leaving,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.960
will you come back?

00:24:41.839 --> 00:24:43.359
Don't overthink it.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:46.440
Didn't my mom say when she was alive,

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.160
you and my Uncle

00:24:48.319 --> 00:24:49.640
are the people closest to me.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.720
I was thinking,

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.359
I'll go back to Sanjiang for now

00:24:53.519 --> 00:24:54.599
to take care of my dad.

00:24:55.839 --> 00:24:56.759
As for us,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.559
let's both calm down

00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.680
and think it over.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.559
If after a while

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.559
we still feel

00:25:03.039 --> 00:25:04.160
we can't let go of each other,

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.720
then we'll solve that case.

00:25:06.759 --> 00:25:07.380
Okay?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.000
Well, look,

00:25:10.519 --> 00:25:11.720
you're about to leave.

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.480
Can you

00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:14.880
give me a hug?

00:25:16.319 --> 00:25:17.319
How should I hug?

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:18.279
Like

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.319
siblings, or...

00:25:21.759 --> 00:25:24.400
It's hard to judge the boundaries.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.559
You just

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.079
just do as you see fit.

00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:35.700
Carry on. I'm blind.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:36.440
Carry on. I'm blind.

00:25:36.579 --> 00:25:37.559
Go, go, go. Hurry.

00:25:47.079 --> 00:25:48.240
Old Fan,

00:25:50.119 --> 00:25:52.079
it's been so many days.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:55.740
Are you going to get better?

00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:58.720
Why are you still feigning illness?

00:25:59.519 --> 00:26:00.640
You're one to talk.

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:03.440
Aren't you in a wheelchair yourself?

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:07.599
I miss my cousin.

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.960
My heart aches for that Department Belle.

00:26:13.519 --> 00:26:16.559
At least your Department Belle is alive.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.420
My cousin

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.680
is separated from me by death.

00:26:25.799 --> 00:26:27.119
But in my heart,

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:29.240
she's already gone.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.160
I'm living a life worse than death.

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:34.960
What are you two chatting about?

00:26:35.599 --> 00:26:37.960
Talking death so early? Eat.

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.960
I'm really sorry, Ms. Liu,

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.240
that you have to get food for us.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.000
Here, come.

00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:45.920
Rest a bit.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:46.640
Sit here.

00:26:47.319 --> 00:26:48.039
Where are the students?

00:26:48.039 --> 00:26:49.359
Said they have a meeting,

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:51.559
and asked me to take care of you.

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.119
Ms. Liu,

00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:56.960
I'm still in a bad mood.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.039
You need to keep me company.

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:00.720
Okay.

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.480
I'm practically clinically depressed.

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:04.220
I need Ms. Liu's special care.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:04.920
I

00:27:05.019 --> 00:27:05.619
I

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:06.539
I

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.180
I

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:07.680
I

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:08.319
I

00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:09.079
I

00:27:09.099 --> 00:27:10.160
I

00:27:10.579 --> 00:27:11.279
I
