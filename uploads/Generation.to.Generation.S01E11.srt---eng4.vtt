00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.900
Looks like Master You
can't clear your name this time.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.570
My foster father devoted himself
to bringing the Mu Clan

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.980
back to the Li Sect.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.260
He'd die for it without regret.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.100
I have been shaped by

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.220
my foster father's words
since childhood.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.220
Always place the Mu Clan above all else.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.270
After my foster father

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.980
was betrayed by that traitor Nie Zhe,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.010
I endured humiliation and hardship,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.980
and tangled with scum like

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.340
Yu Huiyin and Xiong Qianjin.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.220
All to wait for Mr. Mu's return.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.690
Unexpectedly,

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:33.890
heaven is just,

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.450
and Mr. Mu, you're safe and sound.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.260
Now foster father

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.450
can finally rest in peace.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.170
Last night, I heard

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.220
someone threw
Elder Qiu's memorial tablet

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.410
off the cliff.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.660
It must be that scoundrel Li Yi's doing.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:54.540
I never thought,

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.170
he'd commit such a despicable,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.320
unforgivable act.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.220
Mr. Mu,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.410
you should've killed him right then.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:00.540
Torn him limb from limb.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.850
Enough.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.180
Get up.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:18.820
Mr. Mu.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.660
You Guanyue,

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.130
you know the last person
who came within three steps of me?

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.380
Their grave's already overgrown.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.220
I'm utterly loyal to you, Mr. Mu.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.780
Heaven and Earth can bear witness.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.260
If you have any use for me,

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.340
I will surely

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:35.570
serve you with all my heart,

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.100
even unto death.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.940
Very well.

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.100
Then I'll be counting on

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:44.100
your talents from now on, Mr. You.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:51.500
Have some tea.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:15.450
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.020
I've called you all here tonight

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.540
because calamity looms,
and my future grows uncertain.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.220
I know you're all loyal,

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.850
but I can't bear to
drag you down with me.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.900
After much thought,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.610
I've decided to divide all my savings

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.170
among every single one of you.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:38.340
Take care, everyone.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.980
Master You, what's happening?

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.540
Chief failed to ambush
the Six Sects of Beichen

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.050
and fled in defeat.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.370
In a fury and shame,

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.210
he actually...

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.850
He ordered every altar to
capture innocent villagers

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.490
to refine corpse slaves.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.050
- What?
- Corpse slaves?

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.610
The art of refining a corpse slave

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.660
is utterly vicious.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.050
If he dares do this,

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.140
I'm afraid Heaven itself
will strike us down.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.490
Besides, if corpse slaves
return to the world,

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.100
all Jianghu sects
will rise up against us.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.250
By then,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.580
there will surely be another bloodbath.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.930
I can't bear to let my brothers
die with me.

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.730
After you take this gold and silver,

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:19.900
just make your plans for the future.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.180
Plans?

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.140
We, the old followers of Elder Qiu,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.980
have long been a thorn
in the Chief's side.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.170
If we're attacked,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.220
we'll be the first

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:28.460
to be thrown to the wolves.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.450
Years ago,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.100
the former Chief Nie Hengcheng

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.810
refined these corpse slaves

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.340
and throw everyone into panic.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.580
Half the sect are casualties.

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.420
And now,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.490
are we doomed to
repeat the same mistake?

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.980
Those corpse slaves, that unnatural filth,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.490
were the Nie clan's doing
to eliminate their enemies.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.850
Sadly, none within the sect
could restrain the Nie clan.

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.290
If Mr. Mu were still here...

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:51.460
If Mr. Mu were alive,

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.050
he'd never let the Chief
run amok like this!

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:54.900
Don't call him Chief.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.140
That whole family

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.290
are traitors who stole
the Mu clan's legacy!

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.810
It's a pity Mr. Mu vanished long ago.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.340
Seems you all still hold
the Mu clan in high regard.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.890
If

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.660
the Young Master returns safely,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.700
what will you do?

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.700
You Guanyue,
Master of Qinglong Altar,

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.580
bows to welcome Mr. Mu's return.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.930
W... What?

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.130
Young Master.

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:38.500
The Founder of Mu clan

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.290
founded the Li Sect

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.290
to detach from worldly affairs

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:44.900
and have disciples aid one another

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.290
and share honor and disgrace.

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.490
But now, Nie Zhe

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.220
acts against all principles.

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.540
He's cruel and without virtue,

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:54.930
ignoring the lives of fellow disciples

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.370
and throwing the Li Sect into trouble.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.130
The Mu clan

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:01.930
will never stand by!

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.850
Those who do not wish to follow Mr. Mu

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.730
may take the gold and leave on your own.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.220
Mr. Mu will not hold it against you.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.250
Th... this…

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.540
My foster father's
death anniversary is near.

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.700
Looks like Nie Zhe
is about to start another purge.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.810
Wipe out the traitor Nie
and restore the Mu clan!

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.540
Wipe out the traitor Nie
and restore the Mu clan!

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.250
Wipe out the traitor Nie
and restore the Mu clan!

00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:43.810
Wipe out the traitor Nie
and restore the Mu clan!

00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:46.700
Wipe out the traitor Nie
and restore the Mu clan!

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.610
Wipe out the traitor Nie
and restore the Mu clan!

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.780
He surrendered that fast?

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.810
Looks like Mu Qingyan

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:00.250
truly has some clever tactics.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.340
Seize that girl named Xing.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.290
I'll have big use for her soon.

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.180
Yes.

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.220
You Guanyue has always been
a smooth operator,

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.020
currying favor with everyone.

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:23.050
His surrender isn't surprising.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:24.900
But why would the others

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:26.810
throw their lives away?

00:08:26.810 --> 00:08:27.660
Fengge.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.010
What do you think of Mu Qingyan?

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:34.940
I can't see through him.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.690
When Mu Zhengming was still alive,

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.610
he was just a young man.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.850
Every day he only read books
and grew flowers,

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.650
seeming gentle and harmless.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.250
But after Mu Zhengming's death,

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:45.820
he quickly rallied Elder Qiu's faction,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.010
stormed the Bliss Palace.

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.650
He nearly killed the Chief.

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.530
That was just over a year ago.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:56.090
Anyone

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:58.460
who endured what he did

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:00.300
would have fallen into the abyss.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.820
But he clawed his way out of hell.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:05.460
It proves

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.890
he has something to rely on.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:09.300
I don't care what he's relying on.

00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:10.610
Like I said,

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.980
if he comes,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.060
he dies.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:24.420
They've already taken
the Qinglong Altar.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:27.180
Never thought

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:29.890
Mu Qingyan is actually pretty capable.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:31.610
Nie Zhe is such a useless fool.

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.730
Honestly, that's not so bad.

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.460
The two sides fight nonstop,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.580
draining each other dry,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:37.650
losing everything.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:38.730
Perfect.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.820
Dad.

00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:41.850
Right now

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.220
the demon sect is tearing itself apart.

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.770
Why don't we sneak into
the Hanhai Mountains

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.100
and wipe them out in one fell swoop?

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:55.940
Lingbo, you're valiant.

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.780
Yuzhi.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:09:59.730
Master.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.060
What's your take on this?

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:03.650
The Nie clan has held the demon sect
for decades.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.060
Nie Zhe is backed by
Nie Hengcheng's old followers.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.900
His foundation is solid.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:09.980
Mu Qingyan may have seized
the Qinglong Altar,

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.530
but the scale of their internal strife
remains unknown.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:14.300
Until we get definite news,

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:15.980
I think

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.700
we should not act rashly.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:19.180
That makes sense.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:21.770
The Qinglong Altar,

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:23.530
though the gateway of the demon sect,

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:26.610
is weak in strength
and cannot stand alone.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.460
If Nie Zhe strikes with
overwhelming force,

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:29.820
the Mu clan

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.580
will likely be wiped out.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:32.780
And you guys

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.980
don't just focus on
martial training all day.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.370
Take some time to
read more books like Yuzhi.

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.570
Zhao,

00:10:43.610 --> 00:10:44.890
come walk with me.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.490
Zhao.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.460
I promised your aunt

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.250
that as long as I live,

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.180
I will keep you safe.

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.980
This time, I was trapped by a villain,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.060
leaving you to go down
the mountain alone to find medicine.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:12.450
I have

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.490
failed your aunt.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.010
She would never be angry with you.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.060
You are her closest

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.010
and most trusted.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:23.300
Closer than Uncle Zhou,
closer than my parents.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:24.770
Your bond is steadfast, like kin.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.580
Mom's always been jealous of it.

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:29.460
Besides,

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:32.300
if Master hadn't gone to
Luoying Valley every year

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.650
to heal her and sustain her life,

00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:34.530
wasting your inner power,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.060
how could you have been tricked
by villains so easily?

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.650
What's the use of going every year?

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:44.450
Your aunt...

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.940
still left in the end.

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:52.250
Master.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.770
Have you forgotten what aunt said?

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.490
People come and go.

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:57.650
It's all fate.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:11:59.250
No need to grieve.

00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:01.580
I understand.

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.940
There's something I must ask you.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:06.120
About Chang Ning.

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.130
Do you know where he went?

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.850
He said he's tired of Jianghu,

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:13.530
and retired to live as a wealthy man.

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.570
Zhao,

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:18.610
you're

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.130
pure-hearted,

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:21.250
and loyal to your loved ones.

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.580
I don't oppose that,

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:25.060
but the heart of man is unfathomable.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.220
It's hard to tell friend from foe.

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:27.690
From now on,

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.650
you must not leave the sect
without permission.

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.300
Don't make your parents worry about you.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.090
And,

00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:38.100
don't mind I'm nagging.

00:12:39.130 --> 00:12:40.370
I'm just scared

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:43.610
I can't protect you.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.530
Scared you'll end up like your aunt,

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:47.580
stubborn and gone forever.

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.130
The struggle has lasted for 100 years,

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:53.890
causing countless blood feuds.

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:55.700
One wrong step

00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.250
can lead to eternal damnation.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:12:59.540
Do you understand?

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.940
I do.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:05.540
Come.

00:13:34.850 --> 00:13:37.530
Has Master guessed
Chang Ning's identity?

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.730
Fine, I won't meddle.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:44.780
I'm busy right now.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.700
My Golden Silk Armor is launching soon.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.340
I have to manage the shops

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.490
and contact buyers.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.090
(Zhao.)

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.610
(Have you been well?)

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.010
(Dad came back and said)

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:10.530
(Ning has left.)

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:12.420
(Where did he go?)

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:13.980
(I'm so worried about him.)

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:15.530
(How is his wound now?)

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:18.420
(I only eat vegetarian food
at Grandma's home.)

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.700
(I feel like I'm turning into a sheep.)

00:14:21.010 --> 00:14:23.890
(I really crave Ning's wontons.)

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.770
(The taste still lingers on my lips.)

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.460
(My mouth is watering.)

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:32.610
(Where else can I find wontons
that delicious?)

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:35.490
(I should have made him
write down the recipe.)

I once promised Ning I'd protect you.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.250
Never let you face this alone,

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:06.490
or let you seek revenge.

00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:08.300
Now I'm afraid
I have to break that promise.

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:09.820
Zhao, rest assured.

00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.370
I will avenge the Chang Fort.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:13.900
Avenge my father.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:15.850
Avenge myself.

00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:19.060
Once I return to the Li Sect,

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:21.460
I will tear Nie Zhe

00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.010
and the Demonic Camp

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.770
limb from limb.

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:33.720
♪For you, I guard the fading lamp♪

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.060
You didn't leave.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:47.850
The Smiley spilled everywhere.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.340
You owe me a new pouch.

00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.490
The Snow Mountain is at least
a thousand li from here.

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.850
Even if you ride nonstop,
no food, no rest,

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:57.340
it'll take you dozens of days
to get there.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:16:58.890
Why not take my Golden Peng?

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.580
You'll arrive in two days.

00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.180
You rascal.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:11.140
You're alive.

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:12.650
You were waiting for me.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:13.940
How could I dare die?

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.460
Mr. Mu!

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.610
Mr. Mu.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.660
This place of yours

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.660
was so hard for me to find.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:51.250
If someone hadn't led the way outside,

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:52.330
I would have...

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.700
I would have never
seen you again, Mr. Mu.

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.530
My father loved peace,

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:00.460
hated being disturbed.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.730
So he set up a Deadly Formation
outside the Carefree.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.530
Does that mean I

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.770
can't gaze upon Mr. Mu's face every day,

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:10.620
and hear your teachings?

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.460
I can have someone teach you
how to break the formation.

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:15.660
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.770
What have you found?

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:19.380
All altars and strongholds
are sealed off.

00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.250
No one in, only out.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.700
Fearing I'd alert the enemy

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:23.940
and ruin your grand plan, Mr. Mu,

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:27.570
I haven't found where the corpse slaves
are being forged yet.

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:30.660
Keep investigating.

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.740
Yes.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.740
Mr. Mu.

00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:43.220
Can he be trusted?

00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:45.570
Trust doesn't matter.

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.420
As long as he's useful to me.

00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:04.730
(He hasn't killed Nie Zhe yet.)

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.220
(His vengeance remains unavenged.)

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:07.730
(So he surely won't die.)

00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:08.860
Zhao!

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.900
Zhao.

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:13.980
I've found 30 shops.

00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:17.090
Once the Golden Silk Soft Armor
hits the market, it'll stun the Jianghu.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.330
It'll spread everywhere.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.010
Good. With Xingjia handling it,
I'm at ease.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:25.220
Zhao.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.010
You've seemed troubled
these past few days.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.330
I can't help but feel uneasy.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:37.050
What makes you uneasy?

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:42.730
There was a fluffy little duckling.

00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:45.020
Cute-looking.

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.490
But with a terrible temper.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:48.250
After I raised it for a while,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:50.460
I realized it wasn't a duckling at all.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.090
It was a proud white goose.

00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:54.940
Fine, it was a goose.

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.860
But he insists on
venturing into the world.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.730
I'm a bit uneasy about it.

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.730
I fear he might get caught and roasted.

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:08.930
You...

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.490
Don't tell me you're eyeing Master Lei's

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.700
ducks.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.490
Please, don't.

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.330
If you touch Master Lei's ducks,

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:16.660
he'll kill you.

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:27.500
Zhao!

00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.050
I'll buy you one tomorrow!

00:20:29.050 --> 00:20:30.530
Don't do anything impulsive!

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:43.220
Hold out your hand.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.050
Uncle Lei,

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.980
I've fully recovered already.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.050
No need for any more
follow-ups now, right?

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.700
Who are you worried about?

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:01.860
Uncle Lei,

00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:04.460
you're truly extraordinary.

00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:06.810
I'm worried anyone could sense it.

00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:08.570
Your pulse is thin and taut.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:10.050
Dark circles beneath the eyes.

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:11.660
Restless through the night.

00:21:12.530 --> 00:21:13.660
Too troubled to sleep.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:16.660
You're worried about Chang Ning, right?

00:21:19.790 --> 00:21:21.770
He's down the mountain
feasting and drinking richly.

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.220
Why should I worry about him?

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:24.490
Feasting and drinking richly.

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.380
That boy has a hard fate.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:30.140
One day he might die somewhere,
with no one knowing.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.300
What do you mean?

00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.770
What do you mean "die somewhere"?

00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.380
The poison in his body

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:36.810
wasn't completely removed.

00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:38.070
But his martial arts and inner power

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:39.250
have all recovered, haven't they?

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:41.180
By reason,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.010
the poison shouldn't be
severe now, right?

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:45.300
It's not that it isn't severe.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:47.250
But it's quite severe.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:50.140
Incurable.

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:02.660
He looked perfectly fine,

00:22:03.290 --> 00:22:04.980
and fought harder than me.

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:12.860
Uncle Lei,

00:22:13.330 --> 00:22:15.770
they say you're the greatest
Divine Healer in the world.

00:22:15.900 --> 00:22:17.180
Isn't there any way

00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:18.490
to cure his injury?

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:21.460
The impurities in his vital energy
and viscera have been drawn out,

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.380
but beneath the meridians,

00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:25.620
a strange poison still lingers.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.050
One I've never seen in my life.

00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:28.460
Even with all my
acupuncture and medicine,

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:29.860
there's no cure.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:32.290
I've warned him countless times before.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:34.530
If one day he were gravely wounded,

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.140
or pushed his inner force too far,

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.700
his meridians might rupture
and claim his life.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:42.700
That fool…

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:44.490
He's always trying to be tough.

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:46.180
Perhaps he himself

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.860
knows his days are numbered,

00:22:48.250 --> 00:22:49.620
and he's set on revenge,

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:51.940
so he left alone and resolute.

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:53.810
You two were together day and night

00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.900
and you never noticed anything?

00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:58.700
I'll never let anyone

00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.090
lock me up again.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:01.570
Maybe it won't be long

00:23:02.570 --> 00:23:04.290
before you're relieved of your worry.

00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:08.740
Uncle Lei,

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.290
how much longer can he live?

00:23:11.290 --> 00:23:13.660
He's barely sustained
by medicine right now.

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:16.090
Maybe a few years.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:17.730
Maybe a few months.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:19.220
I originally

00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:21.090
prepared a medicinal incense for him

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:23.090
which could save his life

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:24.250
in a pinch.

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:27.490
It's a pity

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:34.570
he's already gone.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:35.860
You don't have to worry anymore.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:38.810
Your master is entering seclusion again.

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.570
I've prepared some medicinal herbs.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.330
Please help me deliver them.

00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:50.620
(Chang Ning)

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.820
(Chang Ning)

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:18.620
By reason,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.330
the poison shouldn't be
severe now, right?

00:24:21.620 --> 00:24:22.610
It's not that it isn't severe.

00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:24.330
But it's quite severe.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.460
Incurable.

00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:29.620
One day he might die somewhere,
with no one knowing.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.220
Young Master said

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:32.770
he can't let you

00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:34.380
be alone and helpless outside,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:37.050
can't let you risk your life
at the Snow Mountain by yourself.

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:38.860
I am already a dying man.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:40.770
If I live and can't avenge,

00:24:40.770 --> 00:24:41.860
I might as well die.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:45.420
(Chang Ning)

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.050
Just bring him some medicine.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:19.730
I'll never expose my identity.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:21.380
If he's missing
this life-saving medicine,

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:23.140
fails to avenge
and dies with regret,

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.330
that petty man will surely
become a vengeful ghost

00:25:25.570 --> 00:25:26.730
and haunt me every day,

00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:27.860
saying I'm ungrateful.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:31.140
Zhao.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.620
Yuzhi.

00:25:35.050 --> 00:25:35.940
It's getting late.

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.330
Whatever it is, let's talk tomorrow.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.460
I need to rest now.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.120
So you've truly made up your mind

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:41.050
to go to the demon sect?

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:03.940
Yuzhi, mind your words.

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:06.490
I'm a disciple of a righteous sect.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.220
Why would I ever go to the demon sect?

00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.050
You're going to find Chang Ning,

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:12.330
and Chang Ning is Mr. Mu.

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.330
You managed to get the saliva
so easily last time,

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.490
surely his help had something
to do with it, right?

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.810
Luoying Valley never forgets kindness.

00:26:18.810 --> 00:26:20.380
If he were safe and sound,
it would be fine,

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.900
but now he's at death's door.

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.860
You must be going to repay his favor.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:25.860
I suppose

00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:27.620
you've even packed your things.

00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.060
(Chang Ning)

00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.570
Yuzhi, if you want to snitch on me,

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:41.090
then let's settle it with a duel.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:44.940
I'm going with you.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.010
Last time, I was healing,

00:26:47.010 --> 00:26:48.530
forcing you to risk your life alone.

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.290
This time I ought to go with you,

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:51.420
to protect you.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:52.460
Besides,

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:55.290
I need to borrow the Jade Sunflower
from Mr. Mu.

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:56.530
No, no.

00:26:57.010 --> 00:26:58.250
If you go with me,

00:26:58.250 --> 00:26:59.860
Lingbo will definitely hunt me down.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:02.090
I'll get the Jade Sunflower for you.

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:03.810
Do you know how to
get to the Youming Path?

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:10.490
This is a route map I found
by looking through ancient texts.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:15.810
It can help you avoid
many eerie caves along the way.

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:17.050
(Youming Path)
Straight to demon sect.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.660
(Yichou)

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:21.700
Yichou?

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:24.770
This map is from sixteen years ago.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:25.900
Can it still be accurate?

00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:30.220
I'll cover all expenses.

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.190
No need.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:36.380
I still have some savings of my own.

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:42.180
The defense of Qingque Sect
will also be my responsibility.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.220
If I don't go with you,

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:45.090
you won't even
get past the Thousandfold Cliff.

00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:46.570
Besides,

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:47.420
with me by your side,

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:49.860
you won't be accused of
colluding with the demon sect.

00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:52.900
Then if I go with you,

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:56.570
I won't be accused of that?

00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.460
You won't.

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:58.300
Why?

00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:02.540
Right.

00:28:02.810 --> 00:28:03.770
They'll only suspect me,

00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:05.140
never you.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:07.050
Comparing people
only breeds frustration.

00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:09.820
No time to waste.

00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.860
Let's set out now.

00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.860
Milady, Yuzhi!

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:15.570
You can't elope!

00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:18.820
(Lunar Gleam)
Elope?

00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:20.090
Why would you elope?

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:21.010
Exactly.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:22.250
Do I look that idle?

00:28:22.810 --> 00:28:23.700
Milady.

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.530
If it's not eloping,

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.990
then why is a man and a woman
alone on a bed late at night,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.850
plotting to go down the mountain?

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:32.620
Ning is in trouble down the mountain.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.770
We're planning to go help him.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:36.530
Then why not tell Master directly

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.990
and ask for his help?

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:40.090
Master's old wound hasn't healed.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.330
Things on the mountain
have only just calmed down.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.180
We don't want to trouble his mind.

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:45.980
Besides…

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.180
Chang Fort has shown great kindness
to our Luoying Valley.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:51.140
How could we turn a blind eye?

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:52.130
Milady.

00:28:52.770 --> 00:28:54.050
Go and come back quickly.

00:28:54.530 --> 00:28:55.370
Rest assured.

00:28:55.730 --> 00:28:57.050
I'll come back as soon as I'm done.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:28:59.710
Wait, don't go yet.

00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:03.990
Can you tell me the truth?

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:05.780
Are you heading to the demon sect?

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.290
Though the demon sect is in turmoil now,

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:15.460
it's still not easy to sneak in.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:16.860
Go persuade Chang,

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.140
tell him not to be in such a hurry
to take revenge.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.800
I'll pass on Xingjia's words

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.290
to Chang.

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:28.090
Yuzhi,

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:29.570
you can set out with Zhao at ease.

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:31.180
Xiaolan and I will handle things here.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:40.140
Zhao,

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:41.830
where are we going?

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.530
Hanhai Mountains are on the other side.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:46.250
Come with me to meet someone first.

00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:47.810
He must have the latest route map.

00:29:48.730 --> 00:29:49.570
Alright.

00:29:57.530 --> 00:29:59.530
The Young Master
ordered me to wait here,

00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.420
so that Miss Cai wouldn't
venture into danger.

00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:05.810
Hanhai Mountains are perilous now.

00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:09.250
I cannot risk
handing over the route map.

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:11.290
Mu Qingyan already knows
I plan to descend the mountain?

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:14.940
How is he lately?

00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:18.860
The Young Master
is masterminding everything.

00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:20.090
He's doing fine.

00:30:21.290 --> 00:30:22.130
Sir.

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:25.140
What's the current situation
in the Li Sect?

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:27.620
Miss Cai.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.860
Who is he?

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:30.900
This is my Third Senior Brother.

00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:31.740
Song Yuzhi.

00:30:33.810 --> 00:30:34.730
Mr. Pig?

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.900
Song Yuzhi, surname Song.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.250
Everyone in the Li Sect
serves under the Young Master.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.530
All is well there.

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.000
Mr. Pig.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:47.260
Have some tea.

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:49.730
He's

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:51.140
Mr. Song.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:52.980
The Hanhai Mountains

00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.050
stretch for a thousand li.

00:30:54.050 --> 00:30:55.250
Filled with countless traps.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:56.380
Without a guide,

00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.180
you'll never make it into the Li Sect.

00:30:59.810 --> 00:31:02.090
Please leave after you finish your tea.

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:04.220
Mu Qingyan promised to
take responsibility for me.

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:05.860
Now he's turning his back on me?

00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:08.180
Take...

00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:09.810
Such a big matter.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:11.730
I'm just a servant,
I can't make that call.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.380
When the Young Master secures his place,

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.810
he will surely give you an explanation.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:18.900
I has other business,

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.250
so I'll take my leave now.

00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.290
Even making wontons
counts as taking responsibility.

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:36.330
I'm not lying.

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:42.090
Zhao.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:42.930
Look.

00:31:44.770 --> 00:31:46.010
Could it be a route map?

00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:51.900
A safety talisman?

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:00.290
We can't just come here for nothing.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.420
Mu Qingyan!

00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:29.860
You chose to come back
and die on your own.

00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.700
Chief ordered us to fulfill your wish.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:33.250
Mr. Mu.

00:32:33.250 --> 00:32:34.420
Chief is merciful.

00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:35.730
Why not

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.490
end the hostility and make peace?

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.730
Let's talk it over.

00:32:38.730 --> 00:32:39.570
Master You,

00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:42.140
you wanted to gaze upon my face,

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:43.900
and hear my teachings.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.700
Why bring so many people here?

00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:47.770
To listen together?

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.460
Master You,

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.420
I'll give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:54.380
Go take down that man named Mu.

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.730
I'll commend you to the strategist.

00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:18.490
Kill him!

00:33:41.570 --> 00:33:42.410
Go!

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:53.420
Master You, do you want to save Xing?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:09.780
