00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:34.990
[How dare you!?]

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.030
[Episode 30]

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.479
You.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.640
Take him away.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.500
And you.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.200
Move!

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.580
Get out.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.420
How is it going?

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:54.990
-It's freezing out here.
-This one.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.870
-Come out.
-Take him away.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.509
And you had to come out here
and go through this with us.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.840
Are the higher-ups not planning

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.270
to promote you anymore?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.950
Are you blind?

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.010
Alright, alright.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.110
Sorry.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.740
And you!

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.400
You,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.370
come out.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.990
Take him away!

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.079
Take him away!

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.750
You!

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.090
Take him away

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.710
for inspection.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.040
Move.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.240
Move!

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.510
Take him away!

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.800
Turn around.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.310
What are you doing here?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.370
Search carefully!

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.150
You,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.870
go over there!

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:40.730
What's inside?

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.030
"Surprise."

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.310
You.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.710
-What?
-Come out!

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.690
"Surprise."

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.079
Speak clearly.

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:49.840
Supplies.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.500
Food!

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.370
Alright.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.560
Go do something else.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.760
I'll watch this cart.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.470
You,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:56.640
-come here.
-Go.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.680
What are you doing?

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.410
-Move the supplies out quickly.
-Take him away!

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.330
So much trouble every day.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.310
Get in!

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.820
Relax. It's me.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.040
Why did you push me?

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.800
What rank am I and what rank are you?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.200
Power-abusing wretch.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.010
I've been roughing it outside,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.630
and when I get back I still have to
take crap from you Imperial Guards!

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.360
Exactly.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.760
If you don't give us an explanation today,

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.620
the Central Army will make you pay for it!

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.190
Yeah!

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.800
Yeah!

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.590
Arresting people for no reason—

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.710
what right do you have to do this?

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.440
Stand still!

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.500
Once Lord Cao finishes the verification...

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.000
Listen.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.800
You'll be released!

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.930
Since you know how to steal,

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.360
you should know
how to do the opposite, right?

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.530
What are you doing?

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:23.920
What's taking you so long?

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.330
It's too heavy. I can't move it.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.080
You brat!

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.310
Don't think I'll go easy on you

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:32.720
just because you're from my hometown.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.260
What are you doing?

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.960
Do you know what this is?

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.560
I do.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.730
Do you know its power?

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.030
I do.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.710
If you dare call for help,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.360
your emperor...

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.740
will send you to your death immediately.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.409
I promise it will be grand.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.600
Emperor?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.220
Your Majesty, haven't you...

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.100
I have a bad temper

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.820
and love killing loud people.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.630
You know that.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.190
I do. I do.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.170
You also shouldn't be this quiet.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.480
Yes, yes.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.390
I mean,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.720
if you ever need me for anything,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.200
I will do everything I can,

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.770
even at the cost of my life.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.520
My legs are numb from standing.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.730
Yeah.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.470
Move!

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:54.360
Are you done yet?

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.870
Be polite.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.460
Hurry up.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.000
Watch your hands.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.360
It's all orders from above.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360
Cut us some slack.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:03.900
Are we done?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.450
Exactly.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.440
Seize him!

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:17.820
This isn't mine!

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.380
You're framing me!

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.390
Let me go!

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.160
Let me go!

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:25.470
Lord Cao,

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.070
this was found on him.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.290
Report it to Prince Duan.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.630
Yes!

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.270
This isn't mine!

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.450
You're framing me!

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.520
Tear off his face.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.860
What are you doing?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:41.940
My Lord,

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:43.920
This person isn't wearing a disguise.

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.720
Take him away.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.460
Wait, Lord Cao!

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.240
Lord Cao,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.800
what is the meaning of this?

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.659
We are investigating spies within the army

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:57.260
under Prince Duan's orders.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.460
We ask for your full cooperation

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.820
so that no important matters are delayed.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.690
Lord Cao,

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.690
the person you've arrested

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:07.880
is my cousin,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.300
Li Wang, a centurion

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.760
of the Central Army.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.490
If you say

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:14.600
he is a spy,

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.120
does that make me one too?

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.620
Or the whole Central Army?

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.630
Or even

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.080
the Three Armies?

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.010
Deputy General Li,

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.360
I never meant that.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.870
It's just that the item found on him

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.890
is something used by that demonic consort,
Yu Wanyin.

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.720
I'm only bringing him back to ask

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:36.510
a few questions
to avoid any misunderstandings.

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.370
Ask questions?

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:39.260
Li Wang!

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.770
Here!

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:40.990
Is this yours?

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.560
No!

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:43.430
I asked.

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.690
He said it's not his.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:46.500
Well...

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.290
Release him.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.950
Release him!

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.350
You...

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.370
You...

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:50.920
Are you trying to rebel?

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.280
It's the Central Army!

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.100
I saw it!

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.310
It came from the Central Army's side!

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.520
Let's go!

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.360
Go!

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:12.750
Your Majesty,
you're getting better with guns.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.550
You're wrong.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.730
It's a crossbow.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.630
Nine Heavens Mystical Fire
Sleeve Crossbow.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.560
Mr. Bei named it.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.410
Don't call it by the wrong name.

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.270
Let's go!

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.060
Flower!

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.480
You go first.

00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.230
Where is His Majesty?

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:09.760
Your Majesty!

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.870
Xiahou Dan!

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.080
I'm here!

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:10.480
Everyone entering the palace
must be searched again.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.260
Generals,

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:13.920
please understand.

00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:15.610
There was never any search

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:17.820
when we entered the palace before.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:19.910
Now you keep
making things difficult for us.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.710
What exactly is your intention?

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.670
I'm only following orders.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:26.540
Please, generals,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:27.500
forgive me.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.130
Eunuch An,

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.360
it's not that we are being difficult.

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.510
After a forced march
of thousands of miles,

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:35.240
the troops are already on edge.

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.190
Could you ask Prince Duan to come

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.890
and clarify this in person?

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.910
If I remember correctly,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.040
Eunuch An,

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.550
you serve at His Majesty's side.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.320
Why is it that now,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.200
when Prince Duan is in power,

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.750
he still uses the Emperor's old servant
to send messages?

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.070
Deputy General Lin, I...

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.020
don't quite...

00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.480
understand what you're implying.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.700
Could it be that

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.120
His Highness is being controlled by you?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.960
Report!

00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.990

[Memorial Tablet of Emperor Xiaohewen
of Great Xia]

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.060
Your Highness!

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.100
Your Highness!

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:28.450
I just received word

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.440
that the Emperor and Empress Yu

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.350
have taken control of the Three Armies.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:33.950
Lord Jia and Lord Cao have...

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:37.770
Now,

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:40.800
the Right Army
has surrounded the bedchamber.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.460
They are armed with

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:44.120
a large number of firearms.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:45.420
This...

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.020
Your Highness,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.560
hear me out.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.400
Where there is life, there is hope.

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.180
Let's...

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:55.750
surrender.

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.480
S-Surrender?

00:19:04.650 --> 00:19:07.000
Why do you still not understand?

00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:10.000
Everything I've done

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:11.910
is for the future of Great Xia.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:19.240
The victor is king, the loser a bandit.

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.550
It is the will of Heaven.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.640
At worst,

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.160
I will die.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.200
Luckily,

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.310
I have you guys to accompany me.

00:19:38.030 --> 00:19:38.790
Minister Yu,

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.280
you really raised a good daughter.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:45.350
Mother...

00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:51.840
Take him and tend to his wounds!

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:56.830
Your Majesty!

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:57.830
We

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:59.350
were deceived by Prince Duan

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:00.410
and deserve death!

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.510
I am determined to lead the Central Army

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:03.960
and swear loyalty to you to the death!

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.680
And I am determined to lead the Left Army

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.680
to redeem myself,

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.360
and swear to serve Great Xia

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.130
with all my loyalty!

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.100
I will not pursue past wrongs.

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:14.590
But from today on,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.010
the swords and spears
of Great Xia's soldiers

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:20.470
must only be aimed at invading enemies,

00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:22.240
not used as tools

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.520
for treachery and power plays.

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.480
Your Majesty, you are magnanimous.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.400
We are willing to shed
our blood and give our lives

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.730
to live up to your trust!

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.000
Your Majesty,

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.830
the Central Army
has suffered heavy casualties.

00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:34.310
The Left Army's losses are lighter,

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.310
but many soldiers

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:37.200
were shaken during the battle just now.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.030
As for how the two armies
should be settled going forward,

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:41.630
we await your instructions.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.540
The Commander-in-Chief of the Three Armies

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:46.330
is now the Empress.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.690
It depends on her decision.

00:20:58.890 --> 00:20:59.620
General Lei,

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:03.160
report the Left Army's casualties
as soon as possible.

00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:03.790
If needed,

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.830
you can ask the Right Army for assistance.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:06.440
Yes!

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.580
General Li,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.400
the Central Army's morale is unstable.

00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.130
You must come up with a solution quickly.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:12.990
If this affects border security,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.480
I will hold you responsible.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:14.910
Yes!

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.440
Generals,
set up camp outside the city immediately

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.350
and ensure the soldiers
are properly reassured.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.480
Yes, Your Highness!

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.790
Yes!

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:27.870
Your Majesty!

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.000
Your Majesty,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.860
Your Highness.

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:34.640
Prince Duan
is hiding in Your Majesty's bedchamber.

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.160
He's holding the Crown Prince
and the Imperial Father-in-law's family

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.890
as hostages.

00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:39.410
General Lin dares not act recklessly

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.350
and asked me to seek your approval

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.950
on whether

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:43.200
we can take that shortcut

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.350
straight into the palace.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:44.720
Do it.

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:45.490
Yes!

00:21:50.590 --> 00:21:51.440
Pack up.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.130
It's time to go home,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:54.540
my Empress.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.030
This... this...

00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:28.460
No wonder Her Majesty could still be seen
in His Majesty's palace

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.460
after being sent to the Cold Palace.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:31.830
Turns out there's

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:33.830
such a spacious secret passage here.

00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:34.480
It wasn't

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.000
this wide before.

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:53.100
If His Majesty had spared

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.590
even a fraction of the care
he gave to Her Majesty,

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.310
Prince Duan would have been dead long ago.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.940
We wouldn't have waited until today.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.270
That's why you're still single, General.

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.640
You don't understand romance.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.640
Such a shame for that handsome face.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.290
Why are you everywhere?

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.510
Cut off their heads one by one

and put them

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.550
right here.

is gone.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.410
That impostor not only deceived me,

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:46.110
but also killed your only good brother,

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.070
Huixiao.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:52.720
So what are you waiting for?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.310
Do it!

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.820

Leave my family out of this!

00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.080
Leave my family out of this!

00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:16.650
surrender now.

His Majesty is magnanimous

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:20.570
and benevolent.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:22.630
He might spare your life.

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:26.170
I don't need him...

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.880
to spare my life!

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:38.060
Take him to the water dungeon!

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:45.860
This...

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.270
Where have you been all day and night?

00:24:54.270 --> 00:24:55.070
There's a war going on outside.

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:56.070
Do you want to die?

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:56.750
Yeah.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.830
We woke up and everyone was gone.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:00.560
Where is Cen?

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.340
I took him home.

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:07.710
Cen is sick. Why did he go home?

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.820
What happened?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.340
A notice in the city announces

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.570
that His Majesty and Her Majesty
have defeated Prince Duan

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.170
and returned to the capital.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.700
Really?

00:25:25.070 --> 00:25:26.350
That's great news!

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.680
I knew my half-baked fortune-telling
was inaccurate.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.830
It kept showing bad omens.

This is the cloak I gave to Cen.

Why?

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:12.130
He entrusted me

to return this to you.

Your Majesty,

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:17.350
you have finally returned.

return safely,

found the body
Prince Duan used to impersonate you.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:36.400
So,

Your Majesties,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.920
please go and see it for yourselves.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:41.690
Alright.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.360
I originally planned

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:03.680
to carry the body out

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.830
and expose the disguise
in front of everyone

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.360

had already been removed,

Mr. Bei,

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.830

How could this be?

He had clearly left back then.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:24.200

possibly capture him?

00:30:32.750 --> 00:30:33.310
But,

00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.680
Physician Xiao came and told me something.

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:39.410
Your Majesty,

00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:41.310
please hear him out.

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:44.030
That day,

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.310
Prince Duan ordered me
to treat someone in prison.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.170
We've used every torture method,

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.860
but His Majesty
refuses to write the edict.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:52.900
How about we

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:55.160
let Physician Xiao take a look?

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:57.420
But when I entered the prison, I found out

00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.770
that the person Prince Duan
wanted treated was actually...

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:02.590
Your Majesty.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:15.800
Your Majesty!

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:16.480
Silence!

00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:18.720
There is no "Your Majesty" here,

00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.980
only the late emperor.

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:20.830
Treat him.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.540
His Highness wants him alive.

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:42.260
Physician Xiao...

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.350
At that time,
Mr. Bei disguised himself as Your Majesty.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:48.330
It wasn't just his appearance.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:51.210
Even his mannerisms
were copied perfectly.

00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:53.750
No one in the palace

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:55.600
noticed anything amiss.

00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:57.180
Prince Duan
didn't suspect anything either.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.180
It's just that...

00:31:58.750 --> 00:31:59.350
What?

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.110
It's just that at the time, Mr. Bei

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.370
was seriously injured

00:32:04.030 --> 00:32:05.290
and on his last breath.

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:06.980
From his pulse,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.600
he had taken a deadly poison.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.320
He was in very bad condition.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.770
Impossible!

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:15.350
When I parted ways with him,

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:17.070
he didn't have a single scratch on him!

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.870
Your Majesty.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:20.290
Mr. Bei's injuries...

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.520
were not caused by anyone else.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.660
I'm not her child.

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:29.910
I'm just a lone soul living in this body.

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:32.120
Everything I said before

00:32:32.790 --> 00:32:33.750
was a lie.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:35.740
Dan,

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:49.090
you'll have to

00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.480
walk the path ahead on your own.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.030
I...

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.720
can only accompany you this far.

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:03.460
The only person in the world
who could harm Mr. Bei this badly

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.720
was himself.

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.230
To avoid revealing any flaws, Mr. Bei

00:33:08.490 --> 00:33:09.890
even took a deadly poison

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:13.160
to prevent Prince Duan from
discovering it through his pulse.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.090
So, even though I

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:16.380
did my best,

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:19.170
I could not save him.

00:33:21.510 --> 00:33:23.170
No need to bother treating me.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.920
My time is up.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.570
Mr. Bei.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.910
This is how it was meant to be.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.270
I'm already satisfied that I could

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:38.560
buy Dan a few more days.

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:42.110
Dan...

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.290
Dan...

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.380
I leave Dan's illness...

00:33:59.630 --> 00:34:00.530
in your hands.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.900
Mr. Bei, rest assured.

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:08.230
I will do my best.

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.719
I still have some internal force left.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.880
Later,

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.750
I want to see Xiahou Bo again.

00:34:29.070 --> 00:34:29.760
By then,

00:34:33.010 --> 00:34:34.600
you must hide far away.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.560
Later, after I left the prison,

00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.570
I saw Prince Duan

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:46.030
rushing over.

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.110
So I found an excuse

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.090
to stay for a moment.

00:34:52.679 --> 00:34:54.030
Watch out, Your Highness!

00:34:54.030 --> 00:34:55.159
But unfortunately,

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:58.210
a secret guard by Prince Duan's side,
named Huixiao,

00:34:58.210 --> 00:34:59.670
blocked Mr. Bei's strike.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.200
In the end, he failed to kill Prince Duan.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.250
How could this happen?

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.240
How could this happen?

00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:27.430
Mr. Bei,

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.330
how could you...

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.880
He knew I wasn't her son.

00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.250
Why did he still sacrifice
his life for me?

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.800
Mr. Bei had very little to live for.

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.990
Perhaps in his heart,

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:49.590
you were already his child,

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:53.620
the family he wanted to protect.

00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:57.230
Actually, I returned to the capital

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.750
to keep you safe.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.010
But I worried that
you might not need protecting.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.760
Now that we've cleared everything up,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.490
there's no need for more words.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.870
Since Nan

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:07.510
said so,

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.750
if I were to abandon you,

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:12.790
who else

00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:14.070
in this world

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.760
could keep you safe?

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:21.160
Nan's child

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:22.840
is my child too.

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:26.710
I have no family in this world.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.230
The reason I protect you with all my might

00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:31.190
is not for any grand cause
of the country or family.

00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.480
If you dare risk your life again

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.680
for this darn throne,

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.670
I will tie you up and take you away!

00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:38.730
Do you understand?

00:36:40.510 --> 00:36:42.400
No!

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:54.590
No. My head hurts.

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:57.640
Your Majesty.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:58.560
Your Majesty.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:02.870
What's wrong?

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:05.730
What's wrong?

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:07.670
Your Majesty!

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.920
Your Majesty!

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:08.400
Your Majesty!

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:08.670
Your Majesty!

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:09.800
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:10.110
Your Majesty!

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:10.910
Your Majesty!

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:11.440
Your Majesty!

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:12.070
Your Majesty!

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:12.800
-Your Majesty!
-Your Majesty!

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.600
Your Majesty!

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:14.070
Your Majesty!

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:14.480
Your Majesty!

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.280
Your Majesty!

00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:17.000
Mr. Bei once entrusted me

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
-to take care of His Majesty
-Your Majesty!

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
-whenever his illness flared up.
-Your Majesty!

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:20.960
Please go back, Your Majesty!

00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.760
Your Majesty!

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.710
Servants!

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:23.880
Servants!

00:37:24.670 --> 00:37:25.470
Your Majesty!

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:26.920
Your Majesty!

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:27.720
Your Majesty!

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:29.050
Your Majesty!

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:30.030
Servants!

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:31.550
Your Majesty!

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:32.350
Your Majesty!

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.080
Your Majesty!

00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:35.030
Your Majesty!

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.800
Er Lan.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.560
You haven't left yet?

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:47.800
I'm...

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.090
writing a memorial.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.960
I have an audience
with His Majesty tomorrow,

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:53.030
so I'm organizing my thoughts.

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:54.440
I'm afraid I'll get too excited

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.700
and forget something.

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.760
So I'm

00:37:58.110 --> 00:37:59.190
rewriting it.

00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:03.230
Are you...

00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:04.640
feeling better?

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.710
I'm fine now.

00:38:10.590 --> 00:38:11.320
That's good.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.440
Good.

00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:15.230
Are... are you hungry?

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:17.140
This is the food I made.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:18.770
It's still warm.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.730
Why don't you...

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.440
try some?

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:24.470
I'll get you chopsticks.

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:26.490
Chopsticks...

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.740
Where are the chopsticks?

00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.480
I'll get... I prepared... I'll get...

00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.380
I remember I got them.

00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:39.170
Chopsticks.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:46.110
Er Lan,

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:48.110
it's my first time cooking.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:48.770
I don't know

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:49.950
how it tastes.

00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:52.160
Taste...

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.500
it for me, will you?

00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:58.920
Thank you.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:12.970
Have you eaten?

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:13.680
I have.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.800
Eat with me.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:22.840
I'm not hungry.

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:23.760
Eat.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.150
Where is Yang?

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:34.760
He was called away
by the Ministry of Personnel.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.020
I stayed because I was worried about you.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:41.190
I...

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:44.100
was worried about you.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.320
You know what?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.550
The Ministry of Revenue
doesn't know we're hiding here.

00:39:49.550 --> 00:39:52.000
They're probably
searching everywhere for us right now.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.500
They...

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:01.790
Tomorrow,

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.140
we're going to see His Majesty together.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.070
We must pull ourselves together.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:06.470
You...

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:08.510
should eat something.

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:21.320
Cen's...

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:23.710
greatest wish...

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.670
was for the people to eat well.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:30.110
You are one of the people,

00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:33.960
and more importantly, you are our friend.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.420
Have a bite.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:44.710
Thank you.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:46.670
Eat well.
