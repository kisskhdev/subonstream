WEBVTT

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.000
All right, you're the one.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.079
Thank you, boss.

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:50.479
Use your mouth.

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:57.000
Don't you have hands?

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.920
I hired a popular streamer for you.

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.479
But you just scared her off.

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:05.120
Doing this...

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:06.400
...is breaking the rules.

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:07.920
Who's responsible if something goes wrong?

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.280
That's way too harsh.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.319
I'm still your customer, after all.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.640
I paid good money.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.400
I haven't even held you accountable yet.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.200
How are you handling security?

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.280
Some delivery guy from out of nowhere...

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.079
...was able to barge in.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.519
Boss Lady.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.439
We checked.

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.680
There was no delivery guy.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.560
Unbelievable.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.319
Nonsense.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.719
I clearly saw him.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.000
Fine.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:36.680
Just you wait.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.079
I'm going to tell President Jiang.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.840
Everyone, get up.

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.760
If you kneel for too long...

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.040
...you might not be able to stand up again.

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:00.760
That earring...

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.319
...was carefully modified by me.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.359
It has a hidden camera inside.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.840
It recorded everything that happened on the boat.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:10.080
So it was with you.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.919
The guests' information...

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.759
...is likely in this folder too.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.719
President Sun.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.360
The Eastern Five Little Dragons Challenge hasn't started...

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.120
...but it's already caused a huge sensation.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.280
Big shots from all sectors...

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.439
...are placing their bets.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.800
This time...

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.479
...we're sure to win.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.560
Good.

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:46.639
What are you doing here?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.759
I was worried about you acting alone.

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.920
It's not safe.

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:53.439
Didn't you also act rashly?

00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:55.240
I'll be careful next time.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:56.360
Yeah.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.839
Cunning as expected.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.800
However...

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:31.879
How is your hearing so sensitive?

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.800
It's due to psychological trauma.

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.839
Let's go.

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:50.399
I cracked it.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.720
Apart from the system files...

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.519
...it's almost all related to Kaye Mountain.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.079
It details Nine Heavens Media's...

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.279
...transactions over the years.

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:02.079
But all the files point to Lang Jiu.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.240
Nothing directly links to Jiang Nanshuo's Liheng Group.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:06.600
That old fox.

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.319
He really kept his hands clean.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.439
It's okay.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.720
I'm here with you.

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:29.439
It's okay.

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.079
It's going to be okay.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:29.680
Cheng Ye.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:16.039
Cheng Ye.

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.200
I'm sorry.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.960
It's all my fault.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.120
You're awake.

00:10:33.919 --> 00:10:34.440
Yeah.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.360
You drank too much last night.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.759
So I brought you back here.

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:42.919
Nothing happened last night.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.120
I know.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.759
Hangover tea.

00:10:51.639 --> 00:10:52.240
It's good for your stomach.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.399
Sit.

00:11:12.919 --> 00:11:14.519
This morning, I took the video Lin Lu recorded...

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.440
...and the ledgers to the police.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.279
At least Lang Jiu and Kaye Mountain are dealt with.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.279
Leave the rest to me.

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.399
Don't put yourself in danger anymore.

00:11:26.799 --> 00:11:27.440
No.

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.519
Jiang Nanshuo hasn't been brought to justice yet.

00:11:30.159 --> 00:11:31.399
I have to stay by his side...

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:33.639
...to find evidence to convict him.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.360
With Kaye Mountain taken down...

00:11:35.919 --> 00:11:36.960
...we must make Jiang Nanshuo think...

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.679
...that this was all Lang Jiu's doing.

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:46.519
Don't worry.

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:49.840
I will make Jiang Nanshuo pay.

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.799
I'll settle all scores, old and new.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.720
The most important thing right now is

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:13.039
to disrupt his Five Little Dragons plan.

00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:16.559
I'll get you a Five Little Dragons invitation ASAP.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.639
Remember,

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:20.360
you must win.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:23.919
Yeah.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:12:58.440
Kaye Mountain has been shut down,

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.399
and Lang Jiu is wanted.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:01.759
And I had to find out from the news!

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.080
What am I paying you for?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.360
B-Boss...

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.279
Tell Lang Jiu,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:08.320
if he wants to live,

00:13:08.399 --> 00:13:09.440
he'd better keep his mouth shut.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:11.519
Do you understand?

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:12.679
Understood.

00:13:12.679 --> 00:13:13.120
Get out!

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:14.720
Yes, sir.

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.799
What's going on?

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:22.679
Kaye Mountain has been shut down.

00:13:23.039 --> 00:13:24.320
Lang Jiu is wanted.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:30.240
You didn't know?

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.799
Kaye Mountain has operated for years

00:13:33.159 --> 00:13:34.720
without a single slip-up.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.399
How could it suddenly be investigated?
