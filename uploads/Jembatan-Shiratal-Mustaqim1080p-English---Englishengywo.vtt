THIS FILM IS A WORK OF FICTION.

00:08.750 --> 00:13.541
ANY RESEMBLANCE TO ACTUAL PERSONS,
COMMUNITIES, RELIGIONS, CITIES OR NATIONS

00:13.625 --> 00:18.500
IS PURELY COINCIDENTAL AND UNINTENDED.

00:35.416 --> 00:38.000
<i>The tsunami occurred as a result of</i>

00:38.083 --> 00:41.250
<i>a 9.1 to 9.3 magnitude earthquake,</i>

00:41.333 --> 00:45.333
<i>- which caused massive tsunami waves…</i>
<i>- Remote areas were blocked by debris.</i>

00:45.416 --> 00:49.208
<i>Responders will continue</i>
<i>monitoring the affected areas.</i>

00:49.291 --> 00:51.000
<i>- We’ll return to you shortly…</i>
<i>- A tsunami struck the coastline</i>

00:51.083 --> 00:53.291
<i>just minutes after a massive earthquake</i>
<i>shook the region.</i>

00:53.375 --> 00:55.500
<i>Many residents have gone missing.</i>

00:55.583 --> 01:00.166
<i>Huge waves, several meters tall…</i>

01:08.875 --> 01:11.708
I got this photo from Mr. Panji.

01:12.958 --> 01:16.500
He was a SAR officer assigned to Banten.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.291
Out of 29 posts in Banten…

01:20.375 --> 01:21.500
DONATION DRIVE FOR VICTIMS OF
THE BANTEN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI

01:21.583 --> 01:23.166
…our main focus

01:23.958 --> 01:26.208
is near the Al Mahsyar mosque.

01:29.416 --> 01:33.291
It's only been five days
since the earthquake and tsunami hit,

01:33.958 --> 01:38.583
and the victim's trauma
is still deeply felt.

01:39.625 --> 01:41.833
They must face a new reality.

01:41.916 --> 01:43.250
DONATION DRIVE FOR VICTIMS OF
THE BANTEN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI

01:49.166 --> 01:50.500
Trauma of losing a parent.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.458
Some of us

01:56.375 --> 01:58.625
view disaster photos like these

01:59.833 --> 02:02.916
the same way we view the disaster images
we usually see online.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.208
Nothing more.

02:06.541 --> 02:09.000
Because it's not happening
before our eyes.

02:09.958 --> 02:11.041
But…

02:11.833 --> 02:15.041
Our support, no matter how small,

02:16.541 --> 02:21.125
will help them realize
that they are not alone.

02:22.791 --> 02:24.583
If you would like to help,

02:28.041 --> 02:31.458
you can send your donation to the address
on the screen, or…

02:33.666 --> 02:37.000
give cash to be collected here.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.833
Thanks for your attention!

02:41.875 --> 02:44.875
HELP THE VICTIMS OF THE BANTEN TSUNAMI SO
THEY CAN LIVE DECENTLY AND HAPPILY AGAIN

02:51.166 --> 02:52.000
DONATION DRIVE FOR VICTIMS OF
THE BANTEN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI

02:57.708 --> 03:01.500
Mom, this is the last box.
The storage room is empty now.

03:03.666 --> 03:06.333
No, it's fine. I'll handle your clothes.

03:06.416 --> 03:09.250
Why don't you sort out your old toys?

03:10.500 --> 03:14.208
I have set them aside,
maybe you want to keep some.

03:14.291 --> 03:15.333
Alright.

03:16.833 --> 03:19.208
<i>- So, we're working together…</i>
- Mom, Dad's on TV!

03:19.291 --> 03:23.750
<i>with Banten Provincial Government to make</i>
<i>sure all support is well received.</i>

03:23.833 --> 03:26.041
He seems to have changed his hair.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.958
Well…

03:30.041 --> 03:31.416
But he still looks charming.

03:34.166 --> 03:37.708
- You kept my old drawings?
- Let me see!

03:37.791 --> 03:38.916
Here!

03:39.458 --> 03:40.708
Oh right!

03:41.916 --> 03:43.000
I thought you threw them away.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.500
Why would I?

03:45.333 --> 03:48.500
It's adorable,
a memory from when you were little.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.791
You once came home crying

03:52.875 --> 03:56.708
after your teacher said to you,

03:57.333 --> 03:58.750
"We never know

03:59.333 --> 04:03.875
which sin
might keep us from crossing the Sirat,

04:05.375 --> 04:08.541
then we'll fall to hell." He said.

04:25.541 --> 04:28.916
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you too.

04:37.500 --> 04:38.583
Dad?

04:38.666 --> 04:42.125
I will be at the post tomorrow.
Dad are you in?

04:44.500 --> 04:45.666
I don't know.

05:06.083 --> 05:11.333
<i>Hey guys, I just survived the tsunami.</i>

05:12.583 --> 05:14.166
<i>I'm alive but…</i>

05:14.250 --> 05:19.583
<i>they can't save my son.</i>

05:21.125 --> 05:22.166
<i>Azka!</i>

05:23.583 --> 05:28.625
<i>Help, please save my son!</i>

05:29.875 --> 05:32.541
<i>Please send a rescue team, immediately!</i>

05:33.833 --> 05:36.708
<i>To Asah Village!</i>

05:55.791 --> 05:57.208
Dad…

05:57.875 --> 05:58.958
Look at this!

05:59.750 --> 06:02.458
I found my old drawings here!

06:02.541 --> 06:06.208
Look, Dad! I drew the three of us!

06:06.291 --> 06:08.208
- We cross the Sirat bridge…
- Hey.

06:08.791 --> 06:09.791
Yes?

06:11.250 --> 06:13.458
I've made a huge mistake.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.833
Dad!

06:50.833 --> 06:53.083
Where are you going?
Are you leaving again?

06:54.375 --> 06:57.541
Yes, I have to do something!

07:01.833 --> 07:03.541
Go to sleep first, don't wait up for me!

07:04.416 --> 07:05.458
Alright!

07:09.166 --> 07:10.875
Give me the key!

07:11.958 --> 07:13.125
Thanks.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.333
No need, I'll only be a moment.

07:22.000 --> 07:26.500
Sorry Sir, but protocol must be followed.

07:26.583 --> 07:30.125
I'm required to escort you everywhere.

07:35.666 --> 07:37.500
I'll take a rest, then.

07:40.208 --> 07:41.250
Arya!

07:44.500 --> 07:46.333
- What's wrong, Dad?
- Arya…

07:47.541 --> 07:48.583
Can you do me a favor?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.208
Stop there!

08:17.750 --> 08:18.791
What's wrong, Sir?

08:34.625 --> 08:35.750
It's out there.

08:37.125 --> 08:41.500
Oh right, I almost forgot it!

08:42.666 --> 08:45.291
- Thanks, Sir!
- Be careful, Mr. Arya.

08:52.750 --> 08:53.750
Hello?

08:55.791 --> 08:57.750
Dad, we are safe now.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.166
Where are we going?

09:15.000 --> 09:16.541
To our old house.

09:22.041 --> 09:27.583
Is this… because of your mistake?

09:30.041 --> 09:31.791
It's not only a mistake, Arya…

09:33.250 --> 09:34.458
it's a great sin!

09:36.541 --> 09:39.333
I already…

09:41.500 --> 09:42.875
We're entering the toll road, aren't we?

09:52.583 --> 09:55.000
Here… it goes in here.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.333
I'll do it, you just drive.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.291
Dad.

11:16.291 --> 11:17.625
Dad!

12:28.166 --> 12:29.166
Mom?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.875
Arya! Arya!

12:40.791 --> 12:42.750
Mom, where is Dad?

12:45.500 --> 12:46.750
Calm down, okay?

12:48.041 --> 12:50.541
- I want to see him, Mom!
- I know.

12:50.625 --> 12:54.458
- Where is he now?
- Arya, can you stay calm?

13:08.833 --> 13:10.750
Arya, I need you to be strong, okay?

13:18.625 --> 13:19.833
He…

13:23.583 --> 13:26.208
He was buried yesterday.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.333
We have to accept it, okay?

13:37.833 --> 13:40.833
- No way.
- Hey, no…

13:40.916 --> 13:42.166
- Don't be like this.
- No way.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.500
- I want to see him.
- Arya.

13:44.583 --> 13:47.791
- Arya don't be like this…
- Where is he now?

13:47.875 --> 13:49.416
- Arya.
- I want to see Dad.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.375
- He was right next to me.
- He is gone.

13:52.458 --> 13:55.666
- I want to see Dad. Where is he now?
- He is gone!

13:56.250 --> 13:57.458
He isn't here.

14:05.250 --> 14:10.291
- It was me. He died because of me.
- No, Arya, listen to me.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.333
I need you to be strong, okay?

14:14.958 --> 14:17.625
- He died because of me.
- No, Arya!

14:28.083 --> 14:30.250
Let him go, okay?

14:32.000 --> 14:33.750
I'm still here with you!

14:44.916 --> 14:46.041
Peace be upon you!

14:48.833 --> 14:51.416
The culprit who hit Malik
has been arrested!

14:52.666 --> 14:54.791
He admits it was his fault
and he was drowsy.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.958
I'll make sure justice runs its course,

15:02.041 --> 15:05.125
until he gets what he deserves.

15:08.416 --> 15:13.541
This one… I'm not comfortable saying it.

15:15.208 --> 15:18.208
The government wants to revoke
all of Malik's facilities.

15:20.583 --> 15:25.583
But if you or Arya still need time…

15:25.666 --> 15:28.333
Take your time. I can handle it all.

15:31.333 --> 15:32.375
It's fine.

15:35.375 --> 15:38.208
Arya and I do not deserve it either.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.250
Maybe the facilities

15:46.083 --> 15:50.250
should go to the new deputy minister.

15:52.875 --> 15:58.791
And that is why Malik
defied protocol that night.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.583
Had he and Arya

16:00.666 --> 16:04.083
gone with the escort,
none of this would have happened.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.666
Arya just woke up.

16:09.750 --> 16:15.000
So, I can't bring myself
to ask about that night.

16:15.625 --> 16:18.166
- So…
- No, it's okay!

16:21.958 --> 16:23.041
Sorry, I've got to head out now.

16:24.458 --> 16:27.041
My deepest condolences
from the bottom of my heart.

16:28.416 --> 16:29.875
I feel such a great loss.

16:30.666 --> 16:35.416
Please call me if you and Arya
need some help! Okay?

16:35.500 --> 16:36.833
I'm serious.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.458
Yes, thank you so much!

16:43.000 --> 16:44.333
Hello!

16:46.375 --> 16:47.375
Panji!

16:48.125 --> 16:49.833
Sorry, I just arrived.

16:49.916 --> 16:52.041
I was searching for
missing people yesterday.

16:52.125 --> 16:56.250
It's okay, really it's fine.

16:59.625 --> 17:00.958
How's Arya now?

17:02.916 --> 17:04.041
Arya…

17:06.500 --> 17:07.625
He just woke up.

17:08.833 --> 17:12.000
- Praise be to God.
- Praise be to God.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.208
How about you?

17:19.958 --> 17:21.041
I don't know.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.458
I don't feel anything.

17:30.375 --> 17:34.125
In my mind, Malik is still alive.

17:35.208 --> 17:37.541
I'm waiting for him to come home from work

17:39.000 --> 17:42.166
to meet me and Arya.

17:48.791 --> 17:50.625
Maybe this can…

17:57.833 --> 17:59.750
Malik gave me this less than a month ago.

18:02.291 --> 18:06.291
And I realize now
that this was his last gift.

18:08.666 --> 18:11.625
You once told me,
don't step into the "field", huh?

18:12.666 --> 18:16.541
If you want to be
a medical volunteer again, just say so.

18:17.125 --> 18:20.000
It might help you through this.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.666
No, Panji, I can't go back.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.333
That's the first place we met.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.125
A man that genuine…

18:37.250 --> 18:40.958
H-How I did not see it?

18:42.208 --> 18:44.500
He did all this because…

18:47.000 --> 18:48.833
he was saying goodbye forever.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.833
It's just too soon, Panji.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.333
It's…

18:59.458 --> 19:02.250
Even knowing our loved ones will leave….

19:03.875 --> 19:05.291
We're never ready.

19:10.041 --> 19:11.250
What we must remember is…

19:13.291 --> 19:15.083
everything has its time.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.083
Thank you.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Thank you for being a good friend for me.

19:31.375 --> 19:34.291
Mrs. Laras, please come with me.

19:34.375 --> 19:35.916
Sure.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.666
Call me whenever you need.

19:39.041 --> 19:40.416
Yeah.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.208
<i>Happy Birthday, Mom.</i>

20:05.291 --> 20:07.583
<i>What are you doing?</i>

20:07.666 --> 20:10.875
<i>- What is it?</i>
- <i>Happy Birthday, Mom.</i>

20:11.458 --> 20:14.958
<i>This is to replace me, when I'm gone.</i>

20:15.041 --> 20:18.333
<i>Wow, you really surprised me, huh?</i>

20:18.416 --> 20:20.750
<i>Wait, wait, let me see!</i>

20:23.000 --> 20:27.750
<i>- Let me join. I want a hug too.</i>
<i>- Thanks for the surprise.</i>

20:27.833 --> 20:29.333
<i>Happy birthday, honey.</i>

20:29.416 --> 20:32.666
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Happy Birthday, Mom.</i>

20:47.375 --> 20:49.041
Arya.

20:54.875 --> 20:56.000
Dad.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.416
Help me!

21:38.583 --> 21:39.666
Mom!

21:40.583 --> 21:41.916
Arya! Arya!

21:43.166 --> 21:44.416
Arya, what's wrong?

21:46.916 --> 21:49.458
I saw Dad here, Mom!

21:51.666 --> 21:53.750
- And there was blood right here.
- Arya.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.125
And I saw him here wounded, Mom…

21:55.208 --> 21:56.125
- Arya!
- He was…

21:56.208 --> 21:58.708
He was wounded
and he asked me for help, Mom!

21:58.791 --> 22:02.083
- H-He was there…
- Arya, please wake up.

22:03.291 --> 22:04.875
It's just a dream!

22:06.208 --> 22:07.291
Just a dream!

22:09.250 --> 22:11.291
I know it must be hard for you…

22:12.375 --> 22:14.083
but you have to let him go.

22:22.125 --> 22:24.458
BORN: JUNE 1, 1978
DIED: DECEMBER 26, 2018

22:39.541 --> 22:40.666
Each time…

22:42.875 --> 22:44.833
I spoke with Dad.

22:47.958 --> 22:50.291
There was always more I longed to say.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.500
But I kept holding it back.

23:04.958 --> 23:06.375
So I apologize…

23:10.958 --> 23:12.791
If I could only say it now.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.083
I'm proud to be your son.

23:29.583 --> 23:32.958
BORN: JUNE 1, 1978
DIED: DECEMBER 26, 2018

23:36.000 --> 23:37.708
I've learned so much from you.

23:41.291 --> 23:44.291
and I'm still learning to be a good man.

23:47.625 --> 23:48.833
Honest.

23:50.958 --> 23:52.000
Genuine.

23:57.458 --> 23:59.041
Thank you for everthing, Dad.

24:12.208 --> 24:13.375
Let's go now!

24:20.333 --> 24:21.750
Peace be upon you, honey.

24:23.250 --> 24:24.666
Peace be upon you.

24:28.791 --> 24:29.958
I'm leaving now, Dad.

24:43.750 --> 24:46.708
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

25:38.708 --> 25:40.125
Okay.

27:02.541 --> 27:04.625
- Help!
- Help me…

27:04.708 --> 27:07.791
- Help me, Arya…
- Dad.

27:08.416 --> 27:09.625
Arya.

27:10.833 --> 27:13.541
Arya! What happened, dear?

27:16.250 --> 27:19.708
Mom… Dad, Mom…

27:20.625 --> 27:24.625
Mom. That night
when I had the accident with Dad…

27:24.708 --> 27:26.625
He led us to our old house…

27:26.708 --> 27:28.833
He said he wanted to fix his great sin.

27:29.666 --> 27:31.583
- His great sin?
- Yes, that's what he said.

27:31.666 --> 27:34.541
We have to go there, Mom,
so he can rest in peace.

27:52.791 --> 27:54.000
Arya.

28:25.625 --> 28:28.083
If this house is connected to Dad's sin,

28:29.000 --> 28:30.333
what did he do here?

28:39.333 --> 28:41.125
<i>What was he hiding here?</i>

29:33.500 --> 29:34.541
Arya!

29:52.875 --> 29:53.916
Mom…

29:55.583 --> 29:56.791
Whose money is this?

30:07.291 --> 30:08.500
Is all this money?

30:27.375 --> 30:28.583
TOTAL AMOUNT OF DONATIONS:
292,000,000,000 RUPIAH

30:29.166 --> 30:30.791
I found this in his desk.

30:41.833 --> 30:42.833
<i>I don't understand…</i>

30:43.875 --> 30:46.791
<i>You talked about a video…</i>

30:48.125 --> 30:49.916
What do you mean?

30:50.000 --> 30:51.583
IT staff reported this…

30:51.666 --> 30:55.208
A tsunami victim in Banten
uploaded a video to Facebook.

30:55.958 --> 30:58.583
He was asking for help,
as soon as possible.

30:58.666 --> 31:01.625
He's trapped beneath a building…

31:03.291 --> 31:04.500
isolated.

31:04.583 --> 31:06.458
He is from Asah village.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.458
Asah village?

31:12.208 --> 31:13.583
Still alive, huh?

31:17.333 --> 31:21.500
- Tell IT staff to report the video.
- Understood, Sir!

31:21.583 --> 31:22.666
And one more thing…

31:24.833 --> 31:28.250
Keep an eye on social media
and make sure no similar videos get out.

31:28.333 --> 31:30.750
- Understood, Sir!
- Wait, wait, let me see first.

31:30.833 --> 31:31.916
For what?

31:36.875 --> 31:39.833
Have you completed
the expense report for Asah Village yet?

31:42.791 --> 31:45.625
That report is very important.

31:45.708 --> 31:47.500
With it, people will see…

31:47.583 --> 31:50.416
We've provided aid to that village.

31:53.708 --> 31:55.458
Nobody will ask…

31:57.750 --> 32:00.625
Then we can take the funds more easily.

32:02.791 --> 32:03.833
Hey!

32:05.041 --> 32:07.958
Do it now, hurry!

32:09.291 --> 32:10.291
Okay?

32:20.333 --> 32:21.958
- Are you done?
- Yes, Sir.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.166
- Afternoon, Sir!
- Afternoon!

32:28.833 --> 32:30.041
Let me see the video!

32:31.166 --> 32:32.083
Has Mr. Alim approved it?

32:32.916 --> 32:35.958
You work under me.
Send it to my email now.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.083
Well…

32:53.708 --> 32:59.083
This is the aid fund for Asah village…

32:59.958 --> 33:01.625
Only the first phase has been released.

33:05.458 --> 33:08.041
These are the reports for the next phase…

33:08.958 --> 33:10.541
Two…

33:10.625 --> 33:11.666
Three…

33:14.166 --> 33:15.375
He has prepared it all.

33:19.208 --> 33:21.541
Wait, wait, I don't get it.

33:23.875 --> 33:27.750
Dad didn't make false reports, did he?

33:29.708 --> 33:31.416
You heard it yourself, right?

33:32.625 --> 33:35.541
Mr. Alim, your Dad,

33:35.625 --> 33:39.291
all of them planning to take
the aids fund, even from Asah Village.

33:42.208 --> 33:43.875
Impossible.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.458
A mistake…

33:47.541 --> 33:48.375
The mistake?

33:49.291 --> 33:52.000
This is the mistake he hid from us.

33:53.625 --> 33:56.541
I don't believe he would do this…
This isn't him!

33:57.208 --> 33:58.291
Then what are these?

33:59.166 --> 34:01.208
And all that money in packs?

34:01.875 --> 34:04.125
That's the first phase of the aid.

34:04.208 --> 34:07.333
Here are last week's transfer proof…

34:07.416 --> 34:11.125
But look, these don't match…

34:13.375 --> 34:14.958
- Mom…
- He made all of these, right?

34:15.041 --> 34:17.375
We don't know the facts.
Please don't accuse him.

34:17.458 --> 34:20.583
- It was him!
- We don't know. Didn't you hear it?

34:21.166 --> 34:24.291
- Alim manipulated Dad.
- Arya, that money is here.

34:24.375 --> 34:26.833
In Dad's house, in our house!

34:26.916 --> 34:28.958
He didn't say anything to us

34:29.041 --> 34:31.916
- about this!
- He can't because he is dead!

34:37.666 --> 34:40.291
I can't believe you don't trust him.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.833
This is all Alim's doing.

34:53.666 --> 34:55.958
Malik…

35:02.750 --> 35:03.750
Beautiful.

35:07.708 --> 35:08.916
Let me see it.

35:24.791 --> 35:26.916
Are you happy now?

35:37.416 --> 35:38.875
Help! Help me!

35:55.375 --> 35:57.041
Help me!

35:58.916 --> 36:01.958
Help me!

36:19.041 --> 36:20.500
Careful.

36:25.833 --> 36:28.000
Slowly, relax now.

36:28.083 --> 36:29.083
Feet first, careful.

36:33.208 --> 36:34.875
The buckle.

36:46.916 --> 36:49.125
Relax, Sir… I'll help you.

36:49.208 --> 36:50.083
Slowly.

36:50.166 --> 36:51.833
- I will help you.
- Help…

36:56.333 --> 36:58.500
- Come with me, Sir. Be careful.
- Okay.

36:59.500 --> 37:00.916
Easy.

37:03.625 --> 37:04.875
Ahmad, Jiyat!

37:12.166 --> 37:13.291
Come in.

37:13.375 --> 37:14.625
Here, Sir.

37:14.708 --> 37:16.208
- Thank you.
- Yes.

37:16.291 --> 37:17.458
Thank you, Sir.

37:23.666 --> 37:25.000
Where are you from?

37:26.666 --> 37:27.500
Asah village.

37:28.791 --> 37:32.958
No aid has come to my place.

37:34.833 --> 37:38.708
I have been searching
for my wife all alone.

37:46.000 --> 37:46.875
Is she your wife?

37:48.666 --> 37:50.916
Yes, she is.

37:51.583 --> 37:54.625
I just want to rest for a moment, Sir.

37:56.583 --> 37:59.000
I want to burry my wife in her place.

37:59.625 --> 38:03.416
Alright, let me help you with that.

38:03.500 --> 38:04.833
Thank you, Sir.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.875
- Jiyat?
- Yes?

38:11.458 --> 38:13.041
Treat his wound here.

38:13.125 --> 38:14.250
Yeah.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.333
- Ahmad!
- Yes, Sir?

38:26.416 --> 38:27.458
Hmm?

38:29.750 --> 38:33.416
- Got the list of active SAR members?
- Yes, Sir.

38:34.916 --> 38:36.958
- Give me the list for Asah village.
- Copy that, Sir.

38:38.041 --> 38:40.083
Excuse me, Sir.

38:40.166 --> 38:42.458
Can you move?

38:43.041 --> 38:44.291
Here.

38:44.875 --> 38:47.083
- You may continue.
- Got it.

38:48.750 --> 38:50.500
Excuse me…

38:57.458 --> 38:59.125
Why don't I recognize anyone here?

39:26.750 --> 39:30.375
Are you threatening me with these reports?

39:31.166 --> 39:33.041
I have a recording of you and Dad.

39:33.750 --> 39:35.541
Planning to steal Asah village funds.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.708
I'm not here to threaten you.

39:39.750 --> 39:43.291
I just need to know why he was involved.

39:43.375 --> 39:46.250
I know it was you

39:46.333 --> 39:49.833
who asked him
to hide the first phase of the aid funds.

39:49.916 --> 39:52.250
Do you think these are mine?

39:52.833 --> 39:54.208
Yeah, it's all written down on paper.

40:01.958 --> 40:03.250
It's was all your dad!

40:09.250 --> 40:13.166
Don't accuse him!
I know he was an honest person.

40:18.000 --> 40:21.833
Want somenthing to drink?
Coffee, tea, or milk?

40:24.375 --> 40:26.625
Don't be so naive!

40:27.375 --> 40:32.833
It didn't take long for him,
a public official, to become one of us.

40:35.125 --> 40:36.500
I know he was wrong…

40:39.750 --> 40:41.625
But he wasn't you.

40:42.791 --> 40:44.750
- He regreted it.
- Wrong?

40:46.000 --> 40:48.458
I'm lost on what "wrong" even is!

40:50.083 --> 40:54.083
Oh right, you're not married yet.
No wife, no kids.

40:54.166 --> 40:56.083
One day, you will get it.

40:57.583 --> 41:01.166
There's nothing wrong with a man
wanting to make his family happy.

41:03.416 --> 41:04.750
What do you mean?

41:06.083 --> 41:07.250
Sit!

41:13.708 --> 41:15.875
Arya? Let's have lunch!

41:16.958 --> 41:18.000
Arya!

41:20.708 --> 41:22.041
Did you go see Alim?

41:24.833 --> 41:26.000
My car.

41:27.583 --> 41:28.750
Your necklace.

41:31.458 --> 41:34.291
Dad bought them
with Asah village aid funds.

41:37.750 --> 41:41.000
I can't believe he was this cruel!

41:44.333 --> 41:46.166
Everything he taught me was useless.

41:58.541 --> 41:59.958
We need to open this case, Mom.

42:02.791 --> 42:06.875
I don't care what people think about him
but every official, even Alim,

42:06.958 --> 42:08.875
must face justice.

42:08.958 --> 42:12.583
Well, okay!

42:23.791 --> 42:24.958
What's next?

42:29.166 --> 42:30.666
What if this case blows up?

42:32.291 --> 42:34.375
Then the government knows…

42:38.291 --> 42:39.416
It means…

42:41.041 --> 42:42.958
his sin will stay forever.

42:58.166 --> 43:01.791
Let's fix what he started
to make it right.

43:03.041 --> 43:04.166
Okay?

43:09.666 --> 43:10.875
Alright.

43:12.625 --> 43:13.958
What for?

43:15.291 --> 43:17.666
Why fix the mistakes of a thief?

43:19.625 --> 43:20.750
What for?

43:25.958 --> 43:27.500
Because he is still your dad.

43:30.208 --> 43:33.875
Come on, just trust me!

43:33.958 --> 43:36.250
- Let's count together, Arya!
- Whoa, I can see it!

43:36.333 --> 43:41.625
One, two, three! Surprise!

43:42.791 --> 43:47.083
- Wait, Dad… Is this the model I wanted?
- Yes.

43:47.166 --> 43:50.541
- Whose is this, Dad?
- Yours, not the neighbor's!

43:50.625 --> 43:52.833
- Really? It's mine?
- Yeah.

43:52.916 --> 43:55.041
- Thank you so much, Dad!
- It's yours!

43:55.125 --> 43:56.208
Let me try.

43:57.708 --> 43:59.583
No way, it's the model I wanted!

44:00.958 --> 44:03.208
- Is it really mine?
- It's yours!

44:03.291 --> 44:04.541
Just like you wanted, right?

44:04.625 --> 44:07.791
- Can I try it out?
- Here.

44:07.875 --> 44:09.791
- Let's go. Try it now.
- Now?

44:09.875 --> 44:12.791
- Right now. Come on.
- Let's go!

44:13.375 --> 44:16.166
This is awesome! It's so fast.

44:16.250 --> 44:18.041
- Look at that.
- I can feel the power.

44:18.125 --> 44:20.000
Even uphill, no problem, Dad.

44:20.083 --> 44:23.333
- Always safe, always strong!
- Even the acceleration feels solid.

44:23.416 --> 44:26.083
Yeah.

44:31.291 --> 44:34.166
I know you've wanted this for a long time.

44:35.333 --> 44:37.666
How did you know? You checked my gallery?

44:38.708 --> 44:41.041
Of course. How could I not know you?

44:43.125 --> 44:46.250
- Wow. Nice.
- Wow! This is great!

44:47.166 --> 44:49.583
I shouldn't have done that to them.

44:50.166 --> 44:51.458
What do you mean?

44:53.958 --> 44:56.125
I shouldn't have done that to them.

44:57.291 --> 44:59.791
Who are they, Dad?

45:04.458 --> 45:05.750
W-Wait…

45:07.875 --> 45:09.541
Dad, why did the car stop?

45:11.375 --> 45:12.375
Dad?

45:14.083 --> 45:15.250
Dad?

45:18.041 --> 45:19.083
Dad?

45:20.541 --> 45:21.375
Dad?

45:30.041 --> 45:31.166
Dad?

47:04.541 --> 47:06.916
- Help!
- Dad!

47:07.500 --> 47:08.791
Who are you?

47:09.791 --> 47:11.375
- Please help me, Arya!
- Dad!

47:11.458 --> 47:13.125
- Please don't, Dad!
- Help me!

47:13.208 --> 47:15.375
Please don't, Dad! Dad!

47:15.458 --> 47:16.583
Dad!

47:28.083 --> 47:31.250
<i>When each of us</i>
<i>is returned to the Hereafter</i>

47:32.166 --> 47:35.708
<i>He keeps the soul of the dead with Him,</i>

47:35.791 --> 47:41.333
<i>and returns the soul of the living</i>
<i>to their body.</i>

47:42.416 --> 47:46.583
<i>These are special dreams,</i>

47:46.666 --> 47:49.125
<i>granted only by Allah SWT.</i>

47:49.708 --> 47:53.291
<i>Dreams where the souls of the dead</i>

47:53.375 --> 47:58.958
<i>and the souls of the living may meet.</i>

47:59.750 --> 48:02.833
<i>These dreams happen</i>

48:02.916 --> 48:07.375
<i>when the dead want to send a message</i>

48:07.458 --> 48:12.291
<i>or ask for help regarding</i>
<i>unfinished matters in the world.</i>

48:12.375 --> 48:13.416
Mom…

48:17.666 --> 48:19.458
I dreamed about him last night…

48:23.458 --> 48:24.583
Me too.

48:27.291 --> 48:28.375
In my dream…

48:30.666 --> 48:32.250
He asked me to help.

48:35.291 --> 48:37.125
He asked me to help him cross over.

48:39.791 --> 48:44.958
Maybe he meant…
the bridge of Shiratal Mustaqim.

48:46.958 --> 48:50.458
This is why after the accident…

48:52.250 --> 48:53.750
I saw that bridge in my dream.

48:58.666 --> 49:01.875
It’s our duty as a family

49:02.666 --> 49:05.250
to finish his debts and responsibilities.

49:08.000 --> 49:11.166
We're all he has left.

49:12.625 --> 49:13.833
I found his video.

49:16.750 --> 49:17.583
‪Look.

49:19.916 --> 49:21.625
<i>I'm still alive but…</i>

49:21.708 --> 49:27.166
<i>They couldn't save my son.</i>

49:28.583 --> 49:29.666
<i>Azka!</i>

49:31.000 --> 49:32.666
<i>I'm here all alone!</i>

49:33.625 --> 49:36.125
<i>Please save my son!</i>

49:37.333 --> 49:40.166
<i>Please send a rescue team, immediately!</i>

49:41.000 --> 49:42.791
<i>To Asah Village.</i>

49:42.875 --> 49:44.250
<i>Azka!</i>

49:55.000 --> 49:56.166
If we do this…

49:58.875 --> 50:00.833
Can Dad’s sin still be forgiven?

50:02.416 --> 50:03.750
Or is it too late now?

50:08.333 --> 50:11.041
Okay, based on the sermon I just watched…

50:14.125 --> 50:15.791
Before the Day of Judgment…

50:18.083 --> 50:22.416
Every soul is placed in the grave, right?

50:22.500 --> 50:26.208
But their sin can still be forgiven.

50:27.125 --> 50:32.125
If we complete what he left behind…

50:35.083 --> 50:37.250
Then surely…
Dad still has a chance, right?

50:40.333 --> 50:41.250
Yes.

50:51.291 --> 50:52.333
Sir?

50:54.708 --> 50:55.791
Sir, what brings you here?

51:00.708 --> 51:02.041
Got a package for you!

51:16.416 --> 51:20.375
Sir, haven't I seen you somewhere?

51:45.625 --> 51:48.833
TAKE MALIK’S LEGACY OR DIE

51:49.833 --> 51:51.041
What is it?

52:14.125 --> 52:15.500
What should we do, Mom?

52:23.291 --> 52:25.000
We'll move somewhere safe.

52:34.833 --> 52:36.958
Then, I will sell my necklace.

52:37.041 --> 52:40.875
Add it to the cash we found.

52:42.083 --> 52:46.083
<i>Together,</i>
<i>we'll buy supplies for Asah Village.</i>

52:46.666 --> 52:48.250
<i>We can sell my car.</i>

52:50.333 --> 52:53.666
<i>No matter the price, it just has to go.</i>

52:56.166 --> 53:00.291
<i>We’ll return whatever he took from Asah.</i>

53:01.666 --> 53:05.250
<i>As for the rest of</i>
<i>the aids funds Alim corrupted,</i>

53:06.708 --> 53:07.791
<i>that business is between him and God.</i>

53:10.916 --> 53:13.333
- Alright, we've received it well.
<i>- Panji…</i>

53:14.041 --> 53:17.333
Are you still in touch with
that friend in pharmaceuticals?

53:18.750 --> 53:22.041
- You mean, Fattah?
<i>- Yes, that's him!</i>

53:22.125 --> 53:23.791
I'll send it to you.

53:24.625 --> 53:27.416
<i>Where are you stationed tonight?</i>

53:27.500 --> 53:30.083
Post 7, why?

53:30.166 --> 53:31.416
I'll call you later.

53:32.416 --> 53:36.375
- If something happens…
- Relax.

53:40.375 --> 53:41.875
Okay.

53:41.958 --> 53:43.666
It's done.

54:03.458 --> 54:05.916
Mom, take Merak toll road.

54:08.875 --> 54:10.250
Okay.

54:20.666 --> 54:22.208
<i>Attention!</i>

54:22.291 --> 54:24.000
<i>BMKG reports</i>

54:24.083 --> 54:26.041
<i>that further aftershocks may continue.</i>

54:26.125 --> 54:27.291
<i>If you feel any tremors,</i>

54:27.375 --> 54:30.666
<i>go to an open area immediately</i>
<i>and stay calm. Food, medicine…</i>

54:30.750 --> 54:34.458
DISASTER RELIEF POST

54:47.333 --> 54:49.708
- Sir!
- Be patient.

54:49.791 --> 54:53.333
- Sir!
- One by one. Slowly, one by one.

54:58.583 --> 55:00.958
Stay healthy, everyone.

55:01.041 --> 55:02.541
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Thank you, Sir.

55:02.625 --> 55:03.833
Sure.

55:06.875 --> 55:08.708
- Come in.
- Yes.

55:10.458 --> 55:12.208
Now, you come with me, dear.

55:48.333 --> 55:50.625
- So, you really don't know them?
- No one?

55:52.208 --> 55:53.416
Well okay, just go to see Mr. Ricky, then.

55:53.500 --> 55:54.625
Okay.

56:08.791 --> 56:10.250
Panji, I need your help!

56:11.541 --> 56:12.541
Wait…

56:13.333 --> 56:16.250
Where did this aid come from, Laras?

56:23.333 --> 56:25.458
Aid funds for Asah were stolen.

56:26.166 --> 56:27.416
Stolen?

56:27.500 --> 56:28.458
DISASTER RELIEF POST

56:28.541 --> 56:29.583
Malik?

56:37.083 --> 56:38.833
Who created this fake list?

56:45.166 --> 56:48.708
Seems like the fake expense report
he made, doesn't it?

56:48.791 --> 56:50.250
Yeah.

56:50.333 --> 56:52.750
That's the list for team SAR
who went to Asah.

56:52.833 --> 56:55.208
After I checked, their names
weren't listed in BASARNAS team.

56:55.291 --> 56:57.833
See? It's obvious now.

56:58.666 --> 57:00.583
All of this is just a cover up!

57:01.708 --> 57:03.625
That village never received
any aid at all.

57:04.250 --> 57:08.291
Ten days, Sir. The quake and tsunami.

57:08.375 --> 57:11.625
Ten long days! That village has no aid.

57:12.291 --> 57:15.375
And now I hear
There's a high chance of another quake.

57:16.083 --> 57:17.875
We must help them, Panji!

57:19.041 --> 57:20.708
Otherwise, the quake will grow worse.

57:24.625 --> 57:26.791
This would be complicated…

57:26.875 --> 57:29.833
- Let me talk to them to help me.
- Who are "them"?

57:30.416 --> 57:31.958
- The government!
- Are you sure?

57:32.041 --> 57:34.666
- We can talk to Mr. Alim while he's here…
- He is involved!

57:35.625 --> 57:36.708
Mr. Alim?

57:38.875 --> 57:43.958
If Alim find's out
we're involved with this aid…

57:45.208 --> 57:47.750
We're done, Panji!

57:47.833 --> 57:49.083
He'll kill me and Arya!

57:50.750 --> 57:54.208
He planned the next stages
of the corruption.

57:54.875 --> 57:59.000
So, he does everything
to keep this vilage isolated.

58:02.916 --> 58:06.375
No, no, that's too risky
to all of you, okay?

58:06.458 --> 58:08.791
Let me and the team deliver this aid.

58:08.875 --> 58:12.000
If Alim could plant fake names
in your team list,

58:12.083 --> 58:15.541
he's got someone inside, doesn't he?

58:17.375 --> 58:18.458
Sir…

58:25.875 --> 58:26.916
Alright!

58:28.041 --> 58:28.916
I'll get ready!

58:38.916 --> 58:40.083
Isn't this mine?

58:44.166 --> 58:48.666
Yeah, I found it
while you were a volunteer.

58:52.875 --> 58:55.500
You guys can wait in the car,
I'll be right back!

58:56.708 --> 58:59.750
- Okay.
- Let's go, Mom!

58:59.833 --> 59:01.000
Let's go!

59:39.541 --> 59:40.583
<i>Hold on!</i>

59:42.583 --> 59:45.291
- <i>Yay! This is nice!</i>
<i>- Go!</i>

59:45.375 --> 59:47.208
- <i>Gosh.</i>
- <i>Gosh!</i>

59:50.083 --> 59:51.458
Yay.

59:51.541 --> 59:53.291
- Is it good?
- Yes!

59:53.375 --> 59:54.750
- Do you want to stay here?
- Dad!

59:55.833 --> 59:57.000
- Sir!
- Dad!

59:57.083 --> 59:58.833
- Arya, stop!
- Anyone, please help!

59:58.916 --> 01:00:00.041
Don't go anywhere, okay?

01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:01.166
Dad!

01:00:02.125 --> 01:00:05.416
Please wake up, Dad! Dad, wake up!

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.666
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

01:00:16.458 --> 01:00:18.375
Dad?

01:00:18.458 --> 01:00:21.250
Dad, why didn’t that girl’s father
wake up?

01:00:33.500 --> 01:00:34.708
Arya…

01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:39.000
Every living person will one day go…

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:41.125
Go where?

01:00:45.916 --> 01:00:49.291
To the next life, the afterlife.

01:00:49.875 --> 01:00:54.875
I don’t want you and Mom to go.
I want us to stay together forever.

01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:59.250
I was as scared as you once…

01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:03.250
when my father, your grandpa, died.

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:07.208
Before Grandpa passed, he told me…

01:01:07.291 --> 01:01:12.166
that in the afterlife, there’s one place
where we can all be together again.

01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.291
- it's called Heav--?
- Heaven.

01:01:14.875 --> 01:01:15.875
Heaven!

01:01:15.958 --> 01:01:20.583
In Heaven, we’ll be able
to gather and see each other again.

01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:23.708
How do we get into Heaven?

01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:29.166
Shh… Arya, it’s time to rest now.

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:34.583
I’ll tell you the full story tomorrow,
alright?

01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:35.916
Okay.

01:01:37.166 --> 01:01:38.375
Good night, dear!

01:01:40.583 --> 01:01:43.083
<i>Oh my… so focused on your drawing!</i>

01:01:43.875 --> 01:01:45.166
How far?

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.833
Up to the Shiratal Mustaqim Bridge, Mom.

01:01:47.916 --> 01:01:49.458
Oh my!

01:01:49.541 --> 01:01:50.500
Honey?

01:01:50.583 --> 01:01:53.541
Why is this drawing about the afterlife?

01:01:55.041 --> 01:01:58.333
Oh, it must be what happened at the park.

01:01:58.916 --> 01:02:00.500
Well, I see…

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:03.208
That's great!

01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:06.208
- What is this?
- The bridge.

01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:08.791
Why is the bridge so big?

01:02:08.875 --> 01:02:13.708
Isn’t Shiratal Mustaqim
supposed to be really thin like…

01:02:14.291 --> 01:02:17.458
a strand of hair split into seven?

01:02:20.041 --> 01:02:22.583
Why? Am I wrong?

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:28.041
- Tell her!
- The “split hair” is just a saying, Mom…

01:02:28.125 --> 01:02:31.625
with little hair,
crossing the bridge is harder.

01:02:31.708 --> 01:02:35.166
Like trying to walk on a single hair
split into seven strands.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:38.625
It doesn’t mean the bridge itself

01:02:38.708 --> 01:02:40.458
- is split into seven.
- And then?

01:02:41.041 --> 01:02:45.125
And every person
will face their own challenges,

01:02:45.208 --> 01:02:48.166
depending on their deeds and sins,
right Dad?

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.625
Right, you're truly right!

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:56.041
Arya’s wanted to learn about
the afterlife since childhood.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.208
All this… is the ruins of Asah Village.

01:03:16.791 --> 01:03:18.125
I believe so, yes.

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:22.000
No other village around here, only Asah.

01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:31.041
Help!

01:03:31.125 --> 01:03:32.416
Stop, stop, stop!

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:38.083
- Help!
- What's wrong, Mom?

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.500
Did you hear that just now?

01:03:58.375 --> 01:03:59.458
Hello?

01:04:13.666 --> 01:04:14.500
Hello?

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:18.250
Hello?

01:04:22.625 --> 01:04:24.625
Help me!

01:04:41.791 --> 01:04:42.958
What's wrong, Panji!

01:04:58.166 --> 01:04:59.166
<i>This morning,</i>

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:03.375
<i>the first phase of aid funds</i>
<i>was disbursed to the most affected areas.</i>

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.166
And…

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.208
The report shows

01:05:07.291 --> 01:05:10.125
the required medical and food supplies
for each location, Sir.

01:05:10.208 --> 01:05:12.708
Okay.

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:15.041
Sign for this one.

01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:19.458
And this, keep it yourself.

01:05:22.333 --> 01:05:26.916
Why is this report different, Sir?
Why keep it?

01:05:27.791 --> 01:05:32.958
Recovery funds for Asah Village
are 100 billion.

01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:37.916
We can take half, but we must wait.

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:40.625
It always comes in stages.

01:05:41.333 --> 01:05:44.958
The first 25 billion is already split.

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:47.875
You already received 2.5 billion,
didn't you?

01:05:47.958 --> 01:05:50.000
This is different, Sir…
this is a disaster.

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:51.583
It's all the same.

01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:57.958
Sit down.

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:03.791
I…

01:06:04.875 --> 01:06:07.791
I’ll give 2.5 billion to Asah Village.

01:06:08.375 --> 01:06:11.000
I don’t want to be part of this sin.

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:14.791
Sin? We're not stealing.

01:06:14.875 --> 01:06:17.541
We’re just taking what’s ours.

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:22.000
What about the money
they never paid us back?

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:26.458
When the government won’t give funds,
who pays for it?

01:06:28.666 --> 01:06:30.083
I do.

01:06:30.166 --> 01:06:32.666
Even your money could’ve been spent.

01:06:32.750 --> 01:06:35.333
But we’re public officials, Sir,
it’s our duty!

01:06:35.416 --> 01:06:38.791
We sacrifice not just for the nation,

01:06:38.875 --> 01:06:42.458
but our thoughts, our strength,
and our time.

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:44.208
Totally!

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:50.333
But people think we’re useless at our job.

01:06:51.125 --> 01:06:54.458
It’s fine, we can’t please everyone.

01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:57.000
Back to the issue…

01:06:58.833 --> 01:07:00.666
We’re not stealing!

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:04.625
We’re only reclaiming
what’s rightfully ours.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.875
And with that money,
we can share it again.

01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:15.916
Problem solved! Harmony.

01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:18.833
Mark my word.

01:07:28.208 --> 01:07:30.333
DEPUTY MINSTER OF SOCIAL AFFAIRS

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.666
Get in!

01:08:44.791 --> 01:08:45.750
Damn you!

01:08:55.333 --> 01:08:56.750
Step on the gas!

01:08:59.333 --> 01:09:01.208
Panji! Panji!

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.333
Don't!

01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:20.416
I know that guy, Mom!

01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:25.083
He delivered that package to us.

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:28.916
He’s the one who hit me and Dad.

01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:32.208
But Alim said the culprit was arrested.

01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:46.083
- Stop, stop!
- Stop!

01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:56.833
How is it?

01:09:57.875 --> 01:10:00.041
- Access is blocked.
- What?

01:10:00.125 --> 01:10:01.750
We can't continue this way.

01:10:02.625 --> 01:10:04.875
This is the closest access
to Asah Village.

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:06.416
Now, what?

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:09.416
How will we get there?

01:10:12.958 --> 01:10:14.583
<i>We’ll carry only what’s essential.</i>

01:10:15.375 --> 01:10:18.250
<i>We can bring the medical supplies</i>

01:10:18.333 --> 01:10:20.250
<i>and the things we need most.</i>

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:24.291
<i>Once we arrive,</i>
<i>we can always come back for more.</i>

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.083
<i>- Okay, that's the deal.</i>
<i>- Okay? Help me.</i>

01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:34.250
- It’s about to rain, we need to hurry.
- Okay!

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.000
What should we do?

01:10:42.541 --> 01:10:44.916
Let's go straight. Let's take them all.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.708
Okay.

01:11:19.166 --> 01:11:20.958
Run!

01:11:21.041 --> 01:11:23.416
Mom, come on, let's go! Mom!

01:11:36.416 --> 01:11:38.083
- Run!
- Mom, let's go!

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:41.416
Mom, let's go!

01:11:58.125 --> 01:11:59.541
Panji!

01:12:02.375 --> 01:12:04.791
- Mom, let's go!
- Panji!

01:12:04.875 --> 01:12:06.541
- We have to go!
- Panji…

01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:10.208
Mom, we have to hurry! Let's go!

01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:11.458
Let's go!

01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:30.875
- No one is here, Arya!
- We should keep going!

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:33.625
Keep going, Mom! Hurry!

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:42.791
Come on, Mom! Come… Come on, Mom!

01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:47.166
Come… Come on…

01:12:48.666 --> 01:12:50.333
Come on, Mom!

01:13:19.208 --> 01:13:21.083
Come on, Mom! Wake up, Mom!

01:13:21.791 --> 01:13:24.250
Come… Come on…

01:14:00.958 --> 01:14:03.083
Help.

01:14:05.916 --> 01:14:08.000
Help me!

01:14:14.875 --> 01:14:17.083
Hey! Let's go.

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:34.208
Help me!

01:14:37.416 --> 01:14:38.875
Help me!

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:40.041
Come on!

01:14:41.541 --> 01:14:44.750
- Lift your leg, ma’am. Okay?
- Mom.

01:14:45.333 --> 01:14:47.208
One, two, three!

01:15:07.125 --> 01:15:09.750
Ma'am… Come on, let me help.

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:18.416
Come with me, we can go! Come on!

01:15:21.291 --> 01:15:22.541
Sit down here!

01:15:32.708 --> 01:15:34.583
Mom!

01:15:36.333 --> 01:15:37.333
Mom!

01:16:07.375 --> 01:16:08.416
Mom!

01:16:09.375 --> 01:16:10.416
Mom!

01:16:13.208 --> 01:16:14.250
Let's walk again!

01:16:16.625 --> 01:16:18.458
Mom! Mom!

01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:21.333
Come on!

01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:28.625
Hey? Okay, okay!

01:16:41.958 --> 01:16:44.750
Mom, what should we do?

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:46.583
Arya…

01:16:49.958 --> 01:16:52.416
Mom, I think we're too late.

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:55.625
- Too late. There are more victims!
- Arya!

01:16:55.708 --> 01:16:59.208
- We can’t save them all, Mom!
- Arya, listen!

01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:02.458
So many still need us, Arya. So many!

01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:03.958
Let’s search again!

01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.500
Let's go!

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:20.041
Mom, someone’s there… wait!

01:17:20.125 --> 01:17:22.250
It’s a villager, Mom!
It’s a villager, Mom!

01:17:25.625 --> 01:17:28.916
- Sir! Sir!
- Arya.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.916
No, he is not!

01:17:32.375 --> 01:17:33.750
Arya, it's him!

01:17:33.833 --> 01:17:35.791
Run!

01:17:35.875 --> 01:17:37.541
Arya, run!

01:17:43.375 --> 01:17:45.208
- Run!
- Get up!

01:19:57.541 --> 01:19:58.666
Stop!

01:20:00.416 --> 01:20:02.250
Stop!

01:20:03.083 --> 01:20:04.541
Stop!

01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:20.750
Mom!

01:20:36.625 --> 01:20:38.083
Mom! Mom!

01:20:39.041 --> 01:20:40.083
Mom!

01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:07.083
ASAH VILLAGE OFFICE

01:21:49.666 --> 01:21:55.583
When the world ends,
everyone who’s died will wake up again.

01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:58.625
Then we’ll all meet in the Mahsyar field…

01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:00.958
There, our deeds are weighed.

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:06.458
Okay, now we’re crossing a bridge.

01:22:07.458 --> 01:22:10.041
Who knows what this bridge is called?

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:12.625
- What is it?
- The Shiratal Mustaqim.

01:23:01.791 --> 01:23:06.916
Did you know the Shiratal Mustaqim
is actually a scripture.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:11.208
The Quran is our guide to enter heaven.

01:23:28.291 --> 01:23:32.916
Sir, please forgive me.

01:23:38.125 --> 01:23:39.916
I didn't come to help.

01:23:41.666 --> 01:23:43.208
Please, forgive my father.

01:23:54.416 --> 01:23:58.375
<i>An anonymous Twitter thread</i>

01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:35.333
Have you seen the news yet?

01:24:39.833 --> 01:24:41.000
It's such a shame…

01:24:42.541 --> 01:24:46.541
in this country, the law
can never bring down a man like me.

01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:51.125
<i>Because of your foolishness…</i>

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:56.958

01:24:58.166 --> 01:25:01.666
And a fool should pay the price. Got it?

01:27:14.541 --> 01:27:15.666
Oh, Allah…

01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:22.125
Grant us entry into the Heavens. Amen.

01:27:26.166 --> 01:27:27.208
Arya?

01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:03.333
Mom!

01:30:07.041 --> 01:30:08.041
Arya?

01:30:09.875 --> 01:30:11.250
Arya!

01:30:28.541 --> 01:30:30.000
Where is Dad?

01:30:45.416 --> 01:30:46.833
Dad…

01:30:46.916 --> 01:30:48.083
Dad!

01:30:48.875 --> 01:30:50.000
Dad!

01:30:56.416 --> 01:30:57.500
Dad!

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:07.416
Dad!

01:31:12.583 --> 01:31:13.750
Honey!

01:31:19.583 --> 01:31:20.541
Honey!

01:31:22.458 --> 01:31:25.750
Dad! Come on, Dad! You can do it.

01:31:27.208 --> 01:31:29.416
<i>That's awesome, dear!</i>

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:34.125
- Oh my, your drawing it's so awesome!
- Congrats!

01:31:34.208 --> 01:31:37.875
So, we'll gather in heaven right?

01:31:39.208 --> 01:31:41.208
- Amen!
- Amen!

01:31:41.291 --> 01:31:45.166
Having such hope is fine, Arya.

01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:50.791
But the one who decides is only Allah.

01:31:53.416 --> 01:31:57.708
If one day… we'll never know…

01:31:57.791 --> 01:31:59.250
Even if we may not meet in heaven…

01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:02.583
I want you to remember, Arya…

01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:06.500
that I’m proud of you and so grateful

01:32:08.583 --> 01:32:11.500
to be your dad in this world.

01:32:20.291 --> 01:32:21.375
Come here.

01:32:43.416 --> 01:32:45.375
Oh, he's coming… Come on!

01:32:45.458 --> 01:32:47.041
- Dad!
- Come here!
