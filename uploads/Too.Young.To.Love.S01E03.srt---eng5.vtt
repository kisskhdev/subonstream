[Too Young To Love]

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.330
[Episode 3]

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.780
Zhao Zhenghao!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.039
If you lose,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.410
you must not pick on them again.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.050
But if you guys lose,

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:58.120
you have to apologize to us
at the school gate.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.120
I'll have everyone in the school know

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.720
who's the toughest guy here.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.800
Two on two.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.930
Let's begin.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.530
Why are they playing basketball here?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.740
I heard they fought over drinks
at the vending machine.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.480
I bought that!

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.280
[Men's Room]

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.590
That's not it. They bumped into each other

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.720
in the washroom, quarreled,
and nearly got into a fight.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.120
Hey!

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.540
I've had enough of you.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.240
Just because you have good grades
doesn't mean I dare not beat you.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.360
Zhao Zhenghao, the school rules say

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360
brawling can be a ground for expulsion.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.000
Since you're asking for trouble,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
then act like a man

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.560
and have a fair fight with me.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.150
Sure. Let's do it in the P.E. class.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.950
It's settled.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.680
See you on the playground.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.000
Hope you won't chicken out.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.130
Or I'll despise you.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.430
Unlike some people,
I don't take advantage

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.560
of those taking a bathroom break.

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.590
Zhenghao, calm down.

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.020
[Men's Room]

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.800
What exactly are they up to?

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.800
Zhao Zhenghao is amazing!

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.000
Whose side are you on?

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.180
I'm on Tong Xiaole's side, of course.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.570
I didn't touch him.
He just fell on his own!

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.280
Sir, I think I have a fractured bone.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.800
Eyes front!

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.530
As fellow students,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.400
you should be kind and supportive

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.150
to each other.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.880
How could you fight each other?

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.490
Here's what you do.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:14.930
Stand face to face,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.710
hold your hands,

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.720
and name five of each other's strengths.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.579
Zhao Zhenghao,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.680
you go first.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.690
What are you staring at?

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:39.920
You have good grades.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.040
So what?

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.740
You're good-looking.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:44.600
So what?

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.060
You play basketball well,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.600
but I'm still better.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.920
As for height...

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.659
you're roughly as tall as I am.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.240
All the teachers like you.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:00.000
I'm done, Sir.

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:02.250
It's your turn.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.920
Yes, Sir.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.720
Zhao Zhenghao...

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.620
is fairly responsible and generous.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.720
He never bullies others

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.250
or loses his temper easily.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.040
As the captain of the school orchestra,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.370
he's highly competent.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.880
Alright, that's enough.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.180
The floor is yours now.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.600
I suggest we take turns to name

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.940
one strength at a time.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.000
Okay.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.920
You have beautiful eyes.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.050
Your nose is the best part of your face.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.240
Your hair is flowy, though thinning.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.390
Your ears look fine

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.040
from the front,

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.300
though they indicate you're a pushover.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.570
Why am I the first one to speak
at each turn?

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.240
You have broad shoulders.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.600
Your eyes aren't pretty,

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.920
but you have great eyesight.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.780
You're endowed with a deep voice,

Alright.

If it worsens,
serious problems will occur.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.440
Yes. Your leg needs proper care.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.310
Got it?

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:50.240
Stop reading it.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.000
I haven't finished the first...

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:58.080
I've done all the papers.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.680
Xiaole,

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.720
something

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.050
doesn't seem fair to me.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.080
What is it?

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.240
Look at your home.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.680
So much stuff exclusive to Yi Lan.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.960
I'm your brother from another mother.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.160
I want the same treatment.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.790
As you said, it's all exclusive to me.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.200
So only I can enjoy it.

00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.590
You're not getting anything.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:18.650
Double standards.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.440
I don't care. My brain is a mess now.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.310
I need a break.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:22.400
So do I.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:24.270
We've barely started.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.750
Every minute counts.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:27.440
Let's continue.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.400
Who...

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.720
Who are you trying to scare

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.880
with that stupid face of yours?

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.510
I don't have a stupid face.
But you do have a stupid brain!

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.240
Who are you calling stupid?

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:04.160
You can solve a few math problems.
So what?

00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:05.310
Gentlemen use words, and not fists.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:06.750
Don't push me any further!

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.720
I'm not pushing you!

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:09.790
Stop running!

00:21:09.790 --> 00:21:11.000
What are you doing?

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.240
Don't do that!

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.310

Chen Fan, scored 100 points. Gosh.
It's a triple digit.

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:26.510
For getting a triple digit
within such a short time,

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.640
Chen Fan, you are...

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.550
a real genius.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:32.960
Yi Lan,

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.400
scored 105 points.

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.960
It's my first time exceeding 100 points.
Great!

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.790
Qiao Mengmeng, scored 125 points.

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:41.640
A small effort has yielded a big return.

00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.030
Luo Ningzi, scored 145 points.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.000
Did you study even in your sleep?

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Actually, I think Xiaole's tutoring
was very helpful.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.730
All I did was grasp the concepts
and extrapolate.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.640
Zhao Zhenghao is here to make a report.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:10.720
In this exam,

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.240
Zhao Zhenghao scored 91 points.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.200
Nice work, Mr. Zhao.

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.720
Please be seated!

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.270
As your tutor,
I'm very proud of

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.200
everyone's recent achievements.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:32.510
Keep up the good work though, everyone.

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.960
Tong Xiaole scored a high score
of 150 points.

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.080
Do learn from him, all of you.

00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:43.240
This is...

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.680
your last summer vacation at high school.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.000
I hope each of you will keep

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.730
studying during the holidays.

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:52.440
Get prepared
for the college entrance exam.

00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:57.960
Mr. Chen,

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.790
you have limitless potential.

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:01.450
You must believe in yourself.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:02.750
All the effort you've put in

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:05.080
will pay off in the college entrance exam.

00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:05.750
Yes!

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:07.920
All rise!

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.090
Thank you, Mr. Tong.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.990
-Thank you, Mr. Tong.
-Thank you, Mr. Tong.

00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:15.690
Well then...

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.200
you're welcome.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.000
Sit or move around as you please.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:19.750
Xiaole,

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.320
can I borrow your exam paper?

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:22.920
Sure.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:29.960
Goodbye, Sir.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.240
Goodbye.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.920
How was my acting? I want comments now.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.240
Alright. Now that the outsider's gone,

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.000
and Xiaole's done with the acting,

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.240
let's talk about the real business.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.270
After a rough week,

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:45.720
don't you want to reward yourselves
properly?

00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:46.270
Yes!

00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:49.000
How about we spend two days and a night

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.240
at my family's mountain villa?

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.240
Sounds great!

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.480
Ning, come with us.

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:56.240
I've signed up for specialized courses
and IELTS classes.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.680
I don't think I can make it this time.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.070
Then you won't have time
to practice the cello with me?

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.480
Look,

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:02.950
hire a tutor to train your skills first.

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:04.820
I'm sure we can hang out sometime.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160
Are you really not going?

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.310
Are you really not going?

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:08.310
Have loads of fun!

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.160
Mr. Chen Fan!

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:13.010
After all I've done for you,

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.960
don't you owe me a proper praise?

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.720
You are amazing.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:19.240
Impressive.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.770
-Very much so.
-Marvelous.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.920
In this final exam,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.480
Lan's scores improved

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.680
quite a lot.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:28.880
Good job, Sister.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.030
Bravo.

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.070
Let's celebrate.

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:33.750
What's there to celebrate?

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.240
It's not like I got first place.

00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:37.480
But you will get there one day,
Sister.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.000
That's right. Cheers.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Cheers.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.400
That said, Lan, take my advice.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.400
Don't stay up late to study anymore.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:51.880
It's bad for your health.

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:52.920
Okay. Got it.

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.680
Nothing can be done without health.

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.270
Yeah.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.400
Dad.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:56.740
Yes?

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.070
I have a little request.

00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.270
What is it?

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:59.510
I'd like to have a two-day trip

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.680
with Xiaole and some other classmates
this weekend.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.140
Can I go?

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:03.640
With Xiaole?

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:04.160
Yes.

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:04.790
You can go.

00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:05.210
Sure.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.030
But you must stay safe.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:07.510
Yes.

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:08.040
Alright?

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.080
Dad, I have one more request.

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:13.440
Can't you say them all at once?

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.170
Speak up.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.200
I'd like to attend
professional cello lessons.

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:20.920
No.

00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.960
Lan,

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.240
I hope

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.610
you will get into a university.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:33.480
Well,

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.960
not necessarily a great one.

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.920
An ordinary one is fine.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.830
You keep saying that all the time.

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:39.000
If my mom were still around,

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.860
she would definitely support me.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.350
Dad, don't you bully my sister!

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.080
Just eat. Don't chime in.

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.160
Lan,

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.310
can we put

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.650
this discussion

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.270
on hold?

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.960
We'll talk later. Let's eat.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:57.310
Come on.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.320
Look at this, a gift from Mom.

00:27:00.550 --> 00:27:01.480
Guess what it is.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.200

if my mom were still around,

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.000

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.840
Such lovely photos.

00:36:23.630 --> 00:36:24.960
Take a group photo of us,

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:27.120
including yourself.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840
Chen Fan,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.550
how much longer
until we get to your house?

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.670
Very soon.

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:49.910
