Let me perform a medical demonstration
using my past patients' records.

It'll be hard to get them to agree
with just those records.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.465
In fact, if those records go public,

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.605
they'll demand that you produce
the cure you used.

00:01:16.405 --> 00:01:17.805
That's what I'm counting on.

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:20.445

Hey, Min Gyeong,
you know Prosecutor Cha, right?

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:22.805
This is my first time seeing her in court.
I've seen her on social media, though.

00:02:23.605 --> 00:02:25.275
She's got a great resume,
plus she's gorgeous.

And her family's rich on top of that.

Maybe that's why...

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:30.375
she's so audacious.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:34.085
It's not audacity. She's just plain rude.

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:38.015
But still, I have to admit
she's pretty impressive.

00:02:38.285 --> 00:02:39.885

I already told you.

00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:20.425
I told you not to come here,
no matter what.

I came to say?

help people in difficult situations...

Then why do you keep asking me
to join the company?

These are the medical records
of the patients the defendant treated,

00:04:48.445 --> 00:04:49.485
and I was hoping...

00:04:50.685 --> 00:04:51.785
you could take a look.

00:04:55.285 --> 00:04:58.025
What were you thinking,
defending a man like that?

00:05:00.065 --> 00:05:01.765

I need the legal fees to pay for
Min Seo's hospital bills.

- I told you not to trust that man.
- I know, okay? I know.

But if it's true that Lee Woo Gyeom
cured patients with incurable diseases...

- Then maybe our Min Seo...
- Please, just stop!

We're joined by Assemblyman Baek Sang Hwa
for his thoughts on capital punishment.

00:06:19.605 --> 00:06:22.005
- Assemblyman Baek, welcome.
- Thank you for having me.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.245
Assemblyman Baek?

00:06:25.615 --> 00:06:27.815
What do you think?
It's a killer plan, isn't it?

00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:32.555
So, Assemblyman Baek is going to make
the death penalty a campaign promise,

00:06:33.085 --> 00:06:36.695
and you've made a deal for Lee Woo Gyeom's
death sentence. So that's what this is.

00:06:37.395 --> 00:06:42.095
We have to pave his way to victory
so we can get our win in this trial. See?

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:44.495
But if he's going to build a platform
on this,

00:06:45.395 --> 00:06:47.505
the trial verdict alone won't be enough,
will it?

00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:50.735
What? You have a better idea?

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:55.705
Assemblyman,
you should appear on a TV show.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:57.145
A TV show?

00:06:57.915 --> 00:07:00.545
- What show?
- You know Current Affairs Forum, right?

00:07:01.415 --> 00:07:03.685
Because of the Lee Woo Gyeom case
I'm currently on,

00:07:04.055 --> 00:07:05.955
they're doing a special
on the death penalty.

00:07:06.455 --> 00:07:08.355
Wouldn't you be the perfect person
to go on the show?

00:07:08.955 --> 00:07:10.695
Me? Why me?

00:07:11.295 --> 00:07:12.325
You haven't forgotten, have you?

00:07:12.795 --> 00:07:15.595
The country's last death row inmate,
Lee Seong Gon.

00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:17.435
What? Lee Seong Gon?

00:07:18.035 --> 00:07:20.835
That jerk.
I put him away when I was a prosecutor.

00:07:21.335 --> 00:07:24.575
Exactly. Creating a parallel
from Lee Seong Gon to Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:07:24.735 --> 00:07:27.145
The 1st execution in 28 years.
It's a parallel narrative.

00:07:27.805 --> 00:07:29.945
Who could be a better expert
on the matter than you?

00:07:32.945 --> 00:07:35.885
If you can sway public opinion in favor
of the death penalty on the show,

00:07:36.485 --> 00:07:39.725
wouldn't that be a huge boost
for your next election?

00:07:47.025 --> 00:07:51.935
So you're saying failing to execute
is, in itself, against the law?

00:07:51.995 --> 00:07:53.235
That's right.

00:07:53.365 --> 00:07:57.535
The law says anyone sentenced to death
must be executed within six months.

00:07:57.805 --> 00:07:59.375
It's explicitly written in the statute.

00:08:00.045 --> 00:08:02.475
If these executions aren't carried out
in a timely manner,

00:08:02.775 --> 00:08:05.045
then the Ministry of Justice
is breaking the law.

00:08:05.415 --> 00:08:06.645
That is a dereliction of duty.

00:08:07.315 --> 00:08:09.855
But if we look at the past,
there've been politically driven cases...

00:08:09.855 --> 00:08:12.085
- Excuse me, you all need to see this.
- where innocent people...

00:08:12.085 --> 00:08:13.125
were put on death row?

00:08:13.585 --> 00:08:16.555
For a murderer like Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:08:17.225 --> 00:08:20.995
if we don't punish him as he deserves,
who's going to fear the law,

00:08:21.065 --> 00:08:23.665
and who will bring justice
to these victims?

00:08:24.465 --> 00:08:28.465
I understand your sentiment,
Assemblyman Baek, but...

00:08:28.535 --> 00:08:31.235
doesn't that risk turning it into
a retributive punishment?

00:08:31.605 --> 00:08:34.905
Capital punishment isn't retribution,
it's justice.

00:08:35.345 --> 00:08:36.745
The ultimate implementation of justice.

00:08:37.815 --> 00:08:41.545
- The ultimate form of justice, you say?
- That's right.

00:08:41.815 --> 00:08:43.215
But the even bigger problem is...

00:08:43.855 --> 00:08:48.055
people defend the rights of criminals
who ought to be made an example of,

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:52.795
and that some people actually defend
and advocate for these heinous criminals.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.325
That is the problem.

00:08:54.565 --> 00:08:59.035
It sounds like you're taking a direct shot
at Lee Woo Gyeom's defense attorney.

00:09:00.035 --> 00:09:01.605
Seventeen people were murdered.

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:07.275
Do you know how much he mocked the police
and prosecution during the investigation?

00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:09.975
Advocating for a criminal like that...

00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:14.285
is not something a sane person does.
It's crazy, that's what it is.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.645
Assemblyman. Sir?

00:09:17.915 --> 00:09:21.555
And another thing,
I heard his lawyer recently got a divorce.

00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:26.965
You know the saying, "Fix your own house
before you try to fix the world," right?

00:09:27.795 --> 00:09:30.535
He suddenly ups and quits
his perfectly good job at a law firm...

00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:32.705
and runs around defending
vicious criminals like that,

00:09:32.965 --> 00:09:35.335
so is it any wonder
his family life is a mess?

00:09:35.405 --> 00:09:38.635
There he goes again.

and you listen good. Got it?

Minister Hong. Hey.
I'm in the middle of a meal right now.

00:12:00.415 --> 00:12:05.385
Were you the one who engineered
the assemblyman's persona for that show?

00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:09.425
Yes, Prosecutor.
You found it entertaining, right?

00:12:11.695 --> 00:12:12.865
You thought that was entertaining?

00:12:13.725 --> 00:12:15.825
I couldn't even watch it
because it was so pathetic.

00:12:16.995 --> 00:12:20.735
- Excuse me?
- If you thought that was a joke,

00:12:21.565 --> 00:12:24.275
I should have recommended you
to a comedy show instead.

00:12:25.535 --> 00:12:29.615
Look, Prosecutor,
maybe you're too young to understand,

00:12:30.015 --> 00:12:32.015
but everything we do on television
is strategic.

00:12:33.015 --> 00:12:34.515
If we had only talked about
the death penalty,

00:12:34.645 --> 00:12:38.015
it would've been too boring
to grab young people's attention.

00:12:38.815 --> 00:12:41.985
And that "strategy" was
to trash-talk the defense attorney?

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:46.795
Thanks to that, the assemblyman's clip
got over five million views.

00:12:46.865 --> 00:12:49.325
If you just wanted to rack up views,
you should've worked with a YouTuber.

00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:53.365
Why are you pulling these useless stunts
on national television?

00:12:54.905 --> 00:12:59.575
Do you realize the top search term now
is Park Han Jun, not the death penalty?

00:13:00.205 --> 00:13:04.345
Park Han Jun is getting all the attention
that capital punishment should be getting!

00:13:06.215 --> 00:13:07.245
Come on, Prosecutor.

00:13:07.885 --> 00:13:11.055
So what, did you expect some grand speech
on reviving the death penalty for justice?

00:13:11.515 --> 00:13:13.385
Did you really expect
such a childish remark?

00:13:19.425 --> 00:13:20.695
Unbelievable.

00:13:26.265 --> 00:13:27.265
Prosecutor.

00:13:28.305 --> 00:13:31.935
You're being sensitive about small things
because you're a woman, but...

00:13:32.235 --> 00:13:34.845
We know what we're doing in Yeouido.

00:13:35.405 --> 00:13:37.215
- Excuse me?
- Look.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.745
The food served is all the same,

00:13:43.185 --> 00:13:45.055
so why do you think
we each have our own small plate?

00:13:45.755 --> 00:13:49.725
It means you take what you want
and stick to your own plate.

00:13:54.925 --> 00:13:57.195
Whether I spoon-feed them
or shove it down their throats...

00:13:57.765 --> 00:14:01.505
is up to me, the chef.
What's all this talk about Yeouido?

00:14:02.835 --> 00:14:06.875
This all started with Lee Woo Gyeom,
and I'm the prosecutor on his case!

00:14:08.045 --> 00:14:11.115
And what does being a man or a woman
have to do with any of this?

00:14:11.815 --> 00:14:13.045
Is he nuts? Goodness.

00:14:17.185 --> 00:14:18.985
My gosh.

00:14:22.455 --> 00:14:24.125
What's going on? What's all this?

00:14:24.695 --> 00:14:26.925
Things look pretty heated over here.

00:14:28.495 --> 00:14:30.135
- Assemblyman.
- My.

00:14:30.735 --> 00:14:34.765
Thanks to your chief of staff,
I've had a real wake-up call.

00:14:34.935 --> 00:14:38.905
See?
I had a feeling you two would hit it off.

00:14:39.845 --> 00:14:42.005
Alright, let's have a drink! Come on!

00:14:43.845 --> 00:14:45.545
This is a great atmosphere tonight.

00:14:46.715 --> 00:14:49.115
All right, here we go. Cheers!

00:15:00.365 --> 00:15:02.565
Counselor, you need to see this.

00:15:02.995 --> 00:15:04.235
What? Did you find something?

00:15:04.295 --> 00:15:07.035
You were wondering about the delay
in identifying the victims, right?

00:15:07.465 --> 00:15:08.605
Take a look at this.

00:15:11.135 --> 00:15:13.745
We did some digging and...

00:15:14.745 --> 00:15:18.615
Every single person Lee Woo Gyeom killed
was a criminal.

00:15:19.315 --> 00:15:20.315
What?

00:15:22.885 --> 00:15:25.055
If the victims were
these kinds of criminals,

00:15:25.115 --> 00:15:27.955
there's no way Prosecutor Cha didn't know.

00:15:30.125 --> 00:15:33.865
Since she hasn't made a move,
maybe she doesn't think it's a big deal.

00:15:34.665 --> 00:15:38.365
Legally, that he killed heinous criminals
doesn't help his case.

00:15:40.535 --> 00:15:41.635
That's true.

00:15:48.475 --> 00:15:50.175
- Reporter Jo.
- Yes?

00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:52.985
Isn't this a great story?

00:15:55.845 --> 00:15:58.715
- Why?
- Come on. You're being dense.

00:15:59.215 --> 00:16:00.885
Did you forget you're a reporter?

00:16:01.425 --> 00:16:05.025
Didn't you write he wasn't a murderer,
all for the clicks?

00:16:05.355 --> 00:16:07.165
Hey, that was a little...

00:16:10.865 --> 00:16:11.895
Oh, right!

00:16:12.865 --> 00:16:16.165
- So the victims are the real culprits?
- Exactly.

00:16:16.335 --> 00:16:18.975
The victims' criminal records...

00:16:20.205 --> 00:16:21.245
Leak them as well.

00:16:22.345 --> 00:16:24.045
Gosh. Now this...

00:16:24.945 --> 00:16:25.945
Yes, sir.

00:16:27.885 --> 00:16:30.855
Jo Gyeong Chan, fatal DUI.

00:16:32.855 --> 00:16:35.485
Hong Jae Gwang, fraud and assault.

00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:41.225
Sim Jae Seok. Fraud, embezzlement,
and breach of trust.

00:16:44.965 --> 00:16:46.035
Wait a minute.

00:16:47.135 --> 00:16:51.905
Are you telling me all these criminals
got off with probation or a fine?

00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:54.205
- Yes.
- What the...

00:16:54.545 --> 00:16:55.545
Gosh.

00:16:56.575 --> 00:16:58.615
These guys are complete scum.

00:17:00.885 --> 00:17:05.185
This may not affect
the court's decision, but...

00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:10.095
it will definitely win over the public.

00:17:10.355 --> 00:17:13.525
You think so? You're right. Next.

00:17:14.395 --> 00:17:15.625
Fatal child abuse.

00:17:17.765 --> 00:17:18.765
Lee Su Yeon.

00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:23.435
It turns out Lee Woo Gyeom's victims
were all violent criminals.

00:17:23.675 --> 00:17:28.475
Take Moon Se Guk. He's a con man
who took millions with a fake cure.

00:17:28.605 --> 00:17:30.845
One of his victims even committed suicide.

00:17:31.215 --> 00:17:34.515
Lee Su Yeon? She's the scum who starved
her adopted daughter for insurance money.

00:17:34.745 --> 00:17:38.255
The test subjects that Lee Woo Gyeom
used to create the cure...

00:17:38.615 --> 00:17:40.825
were exactly these kinds of lowlifes.
That's what this means.

00:17:41.125 --> 00:17:42.885
If this is all true, of course.

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:46.965
So who's the real monster here?
Lee Woo Gyeom, or his victims?

00:17:53.335 --> 00:17:55.665
Pathetic. Squirming just because
I stepped on them a little.

00:18:06.745 --> 00:18:10.685
Lengthy traffic delays are expected today
near the Gyeongsu Expressway.

00:18:10.715 --> 00:18:12.415
- Near the courthouse for the trial...
- Execute Lee Woo Gyeom!

00:18:12.485 --> 00:18:14.125
- We advise any citizens in the area...
- Execute him!

00:18:14.185 --> 00:18:15.555
- to please find...
- Lawyer, resign!

00:18:15.625 --> 00:18:17.925
- an alternate route.
- Resign!

00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:21.595
- Execute Lee Woo Gyeom!
- Execute him! Execute him!

00:18:21.665 --> 00:18:25.035
- His lawyer must resign!
- Resign! Resign!

00:18:25.795 --> 00:18:27.605
(Defense, prosecution)

00:18:27.665 --> 00:18:28.765
Your Honor.

00:18:30.005 --> 00:18:31.405
I would like to submit
additional evidence...

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:34.075
to substantiate the defendant,
Lee Woo Gyeom's, claim...

00:18:34.475 --> 00:18:36.445
that he cured the witnesses.

00:18:37.445 --> 00:18:40.145
Objection.
The examination of evidence is complete.

00:18:40.585 --> 00:18:44.855
Counselor, haven't we concluded
the evidence and witness exams?

00:18:45.285 --> 00:18:48.585
The benefit of the doubt must
go to the defendant.

00:18:48.655 --> 00:18:51.855
That is a basic principle of criminal law.
And the core issue in this trial...

00:18:51.955 --> 00:18:55.125
is to prove the motive for the crime,
which the prosecution has dismissed.

00:18:55.495 --> 00:18:56.595
This evidence is also...

00:18:57.165 --> 00:18:58.935
related to the motive for the crime.

00:18:59.195 --> 00:19:00.905
I humbly ask the court
to give it due consideration.

00:19:00.965 --> 00:19:03.505
What further evidence could you have?

00:19:03.575 --> 00:19:06.945
I have a total of three pieces
of evidence to submit today.

00:19:07.805 --> 00:19:08.975
The first is...

00:19:09.805 --> 00:19:11.775
the cure research that the defendant,
Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:19:12.745 --> 00:19:15.645
submitted to a public contest held by...

00:19:16.785 --> 00:19:18.685
the Global Medical Group, Chaeum.

00:19:26.995 --> 00:19:29.265
(Republic of Korea Court)

00:19:29.325 --> 00:19:31.035
(Blood Treatment Development Proposal,
Grade A Plus Evaluation Report)

00:19:31.095 --> 00:19:32.235
Back when the defendant...

00:19:33.065 --> 00:19:34.435
was a medical student,

00:19:35.065 --> 00:19:36.335
he submitted his own idea...

00:19:36.935 --> 00:19:39.575
for a blood treatment to Chaeum.
The principle behind that treatment...

00:19:39.875 --> 00:19:44.245
and the one he's claiming to have now are,
in theory, identical.

00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:46.585
At the time, the defendant's idea...

00:19:46.845 --> 00:19:49.285
was highly praised by
Chaeum's researchers,

00:19:49.345 --> 00:19:53.325
and we've confirmed they even
discussed developing it.

00:19:56.055 --> 00:19:57.055
(Blood Treatment Implementation Plan)

00:19:58.795 --> 00:19:59.865
(Regarding the blood treatment project,)

00:19:59.925 --> 00:20:00.925
(Chaeum Medical Group grants approval.)

00:20:00.995 --> 00:20:01.995
(Approved by: CEO Chae Jeong Su)

00:20:04.395 --> 00:20:05.395
However,

00:20:06.235 --> 00:20:07.265
the defendant,

00:20:07.835 --> 00:20:10.705
for three years after
the drunk driving accident...

00:20:10.905 --> 00:20:12.635
caused by Jo Gyeong Chan,

00:20:13.505 --> 00:20:16.445
had to face a reality where his life
and all his hope had collapsed.

00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:19.645
In a world of endless darkness and pain,

00:20:20.215 --> 00:20:22.485
he had to force himself
to get through each and every day.

00:20:23.285 --> 00:20:26.585
In the process, he had to watch
his dream as a medical student...

00:20:27.085 --> 00:20:28.585
disappear in an endless cycle of despair.

00:20:29.325 --> 00:20:30.355
And yet,

00:20:31.125 --> 00:20:32.525
the man who caused the accident,
Jo Gyeong Chan,

00:20:33.055 --> 00:20:34.595
was deemed to have diminished capacity...

00:20:35.095 --> 00:20:36.735
and received no punishment at all.

00:20:37.165 --> 00:20:41.405
He returned to society,
got behind the wheel drunk again,

00:20:41.605 --> 00:20:45.405
and took the life of a child.

00:20:48.205 --> 00:20:49.275
That's when the defendant made a decision.

00:20:50.015 --> 00:20:54.245
He would target violent criminals who
exploited legal loopholes to reoffend...

00:20:54.885 --> 00:20:57.085
and make them the subjects
of his research.

00:20:57.515 --> 00:21:00.885
Counselor, regarding your statement that
he murdered violent criminals,

00:21:01.285 --> 00:21:02.485
do you have evidence to support it?

00:21:03.155 --> 00:21:04.325
As my second piece of evidence,

00:21:04.995 --> 00:21:09.025
I would like to submit
the victims' criminal records.

00:21:23.045 --> 00:21:24.575
Every single victim was a violent
criminal...

00:21:25.515 --> 00:21:27.185
with a record...

00:21:27.815 --> 00:21:31.515
of assault, fraud, robbery, rape,
and even murder.

00:21:32.015 --> 00:21:35.055
Your Honor, even if that's true,
the defendant's actions...

00:21:35.225 --> 00:21:38.555
are nothing more than vigilantism,
which has no standing in a court of law.

00:21:39.755 --> 00:21:40.825
Agreed.

00:21:42.925 --> 00:21:44.295
We are not asking you...

00:21:45.565 --> 00:21:47.135
to condone his vigilantism.

00:21:47.465 --> 00:21:49.635
(Prosecution)

00:21:49.705 --> 00:21:50.935
Our point is that the defendant...

00:21:52.075 --> 00:21:54.945
exclusively targeted violent criminals.

00:21:56.045 --> 00:21:57.575
We ask for leniency based on the fact...

00:21:59.175 --> 00:22:01.215
that he never harmed...

00:22:01.845 --> 00:22:03.485
a single innocent citizen.

00:22:04.355 --> 00:22:05.415
Objection, Your Honor.

00:22:05.685 --> 00:22:09.955
- There's no proof anyone was cured.
- Sustained.

00:22:10.355 --> 00:22:14.565
Counselor, there is no proof
that the defendant cured anyone.

00:22:14.825 --> 00:22:15.895
Granted.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.235
Until now.

00:22:19.235 --> 00:22:20.235
You...

00:22:21.305 --> 00:22:23.165
You had the cure this whole time?

00:22:25.005 --> 00:22:26.005
Yes.

00:22:27.605 --> 00:22:30.845
And for my third and final piece
of evidence,

00:22:32.745 --> 00:22:34.915
I will submit the very cure
the defendant claims to have.

00:22:57.735 --> 00:22:58.905
But, Counselor,

00:23:00.305 --> 00:23:01.805
are you claiming the active ingredient...

00:23:02.605 --> 00:23:04.275
in this cure is blood?

00:23:05.115 --> 00:23:06.645
Yes, that's correct.

00:23:07.485 --> 00:23:09.415
And whose blood would that be?

00:23:13.925 --> 00:23:14.925
The blood...

00:23:16.025 --> 00:23:17.425
of the man sitting right here.

00:23:24.065 --> 00:23:25.095
It's right here.

00:23:26.735 --> 00:23:29.035
- What do you think you're doing?
- I told you, it's right here.

00:23:35.045 --> 00:23:38.145
There never was a cure to begin with,
was there?

00:23:40.915 --> 00:23:41.915
My blood.

00:23:43.685 --> 00:23:45.155
My blood is the cure.

00:23:49.425 --> 00:23:51.925
My mutated blood contains healing cells.

00:23:52.695 --> 00:23:54.925
Of course, it can't be injected directly
into a person,

00:23:56.365 --> 00:23:58.335
but we can culture the safe cells.

00:24:00.935 --> 00:24:01.935
And that's what...

00:24:02.835 --> 00:24:04.405
you tested on the people who died?

00:24:06.735 --> 00:24:09.775
If I had claimed this from the start,
you would have seen me as a lunatic.

00:24:12.275 --> 00:24:13.345
So that's why...

00:24:15.445 --> 00:24:16.855
from the very beginning,

00:24:18.015 --> 00:24:19.285
you asked me to find those witnesses?

00:24:19.985 --> 00:24:22.225
You see, people won't believe something...

00:24:22.885 --> 00:24:24.095
until they see it for themselves.

00:24:27.525 --> 00:24:29.825
What's the status on
Lee Woo Gyeom's blood analysis report?

00:24:30.295 --> 00:24:32.065
I just got the email,
and I'm looking at it now.

00:24:32.365 --> 00:24:33.395
Hold on a sec, Counselor.

00:24:38.075 --> 00:24:39.605
Wait, hold on.

00:24:40.205 --> 00:24:42.205
Submission. Okay.

00:24:43.615 --> 00:24:47.045
This is all technical jargon.
I have no idea what any of it means.

00:24:47.245 --> 00:24:51.615
The trial is tomorrow. We're out of time.
Just send it to Jae Hee for now.

00:24:58.425 --> 00:24:59.425
Hey.

00:25:00.325 --> 00:25:01.725
About that file you sent.

00:25:02.625 --> 00:25:05.865
It's a method where healthy somatic cells
self-heal damaged ones.

00:25:06.465 --> 00:25:09.535
Theoretically, it's the most ideal form
of treatment.

00:25:11.935 --> 00:25:13.605
Meaning, it could potentially be a cure.

00:25:18.615 --> 00:25:19.875
This is Lee Woo Gyeom's blood.

00:25:28.985 --> 00:25:32.695
Your Honor, no piece of evidence
can take precedence over the murder...

00:25:32.755 --> 00:25:33.795
of 17 people.

00:25:33.795 --> 00:25:36.865
We have never denied the facts
of the crime.

00:25:37.665 --> 00:25:38.665
However,

00:25:38.965 --> 00:25:43.535
we ask for a chance to confirm
if he can truly cure the terminally ill...

00:25:44.475 --> 00:25:48.475
- That is the chance we are asking for.
- What do you mean by a chance?

00:25:49.105 --> 00:25:50.615
Before the next hearing,

00:25:51.775 --> 00:25:54.645
so that the defendant, Lee Woo Gyeom,
can treat terminally ill patients,

00:25:56.315 --> 00:25:57.785
we request a medical demonstration.

00:25:58.755 --> 00:26:02.125
Your Honor, the defense is now using
an illogical and preposterous argument...

00:26:02.355 --> 00:26:05.125
- to mislead this court.
- That is not true.

00:26:05.595 --> 00:26:09.495
All our evidence provides the reasoning
for the medical demonstration,

00:26:10.595 --> 00:26:13.135
- and the justification for it.
- This is nothing but...

00:26:13.665 --> 00:26:16.535
a dramatic show you'd only see
in the movies.

00:26:16.605 --> 00:26:17.775
Is the prosecution...

00:26:19.505 --> 00:26:21.975
perhaps afraid that the defendant's
medical demonstration...

00:26:22.905 --> 00:26:23.945
will be a success?

00:26:24.275 --> 00:26:25.275
Excuse me?

00:26:25.915 --> 00:26:27.845
If the defendant's medical demonstration
is a success,

00:26:28.245 --> 00:26:30.045
wouldn't that be a good thing
for everyone?

00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:45.235
I'm sure everyone here
in this courtroom today...

00:26:47.235 --> 00:26:49.065
is hoping the defendant
sitting before them...

00:26:50.335 --> 00:26:52.135
is not a spree killer,

00:26:52.805 --> 00:26:56.845
but rather, someone
who can actually cure the terminally ill.

00:26:58.475 --> 00:26:59.815
Isn't that what you're all
secretly wishing for?

00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:08.855
Your Honor.

00:27:11.325 --> 00:27:14.895
If this impossible miracle
could truly become a reality...

00:27:16.495 --> 00:27:17.595
Then, as a final request,

00:27:19.565 --> 00:27:24.405
giving the defendant a chance to prove it
through a medical demonstration...

00:27:26.375 --> 00:27:28.305
would be the wisest course of action.

00:27:33.275 --> 00:27:34.385
That is all.

00:27:46.555 --> 00:27:48.625
(Defendant)

00:27:48.695 --> 00:27:52.595
- What was that? You said nothing to me.
- You have plenty of your own secrets.

00:27:57.205 --> 00:28:00.035
This court is adjourned for the day.

00:28:00.305 --> 00:28:02.405
(Defendant)

00:28:07.915 --> 00:28:08.985
Counselor, what are your thoughts
right now?

00:28:08.985 --> 00:28:11.285
- Do you believe Lee Woo Gyeom?
- Any comment on the trial?

00:28:11.285 --> 00:28:13.355
If the defendant's claims
turn out to be false,

00:28:13.655 --> 00:28:16.025
how will you take responsibility
for the ensuing social chaos?

00:28:17.055 --> 00:28:18.755
If the defendant's statement
turns out to be a lie,

00:28:20.025 --> 00:28:22.365
then I will resign from the bar.

00:28:23.225 --> 00:28:24.995
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

00:28:25.735 --> 00:28:26.895
I am.

00:28:27.865 --> 00:28:29.205
As the trial continues to unfold,

00:28:29.205 --> 00:28:32.435
new evidence in Lee Woo Gyeom's case
has come to light,

00:28:32.505 --> 00:28:33.745
sending shockwaves through the public.

00:28:34.105 --> 00:28:38.375
Unlike the first trial, people now demand
to verify his healing abilities,

00:28:38.445 --> 00:28:40.275
- and these calls are growing louder.
- Execute him!

00:28:40.345 --> 00:28:42.045
- Execute Lee Woo Gyeom!
- Many are concerned...

00:28:42.045 --> 00:28:43.115
these unverified claims of a cure...

00:28:43.185 --> 00:28:46.385
- Execute him! His lawyer should resign!
- will be accepted as fact and...

00:28:48.755 --> 00:28:51.325
You're going to be more famous than me
at this rate, aren't you?

00:28:52.095 --> 00:28:54.795
Don't be ridiculous.
The real trial is just beginning.

00:28:56.095 --> 00:28:58.995
The NFS and the American Blood Association
will analyze the blood sample,

00:28:59.065 --> 00:29:03.205
and what matters most
is how the court interprets the results.

00:29:08.945 --> 00:29:12.815
You can relax a little now.
In the end, the verdict...

00:29:13.215 --> 00:29:15.045
will be exactly what you predicted.

00:29:15.415 --> 00:29:17.785
It better be. Because if it's not,

00:29:18.655 --> 00:29:20.055
you won't have to worry about the court.

00:29:21.225 --> 00:29:22.325
I'll end you then.

00:29:25.295 --> 00:29:26.355
By the way, Woo Gyeom.

00:29:27.925 --> 00:29:30.065
What in the world happened
to your research notebook?

00:29:32.235 --> 00:29:33.395
Where on earth did it go?

00:29:34.505 --> 00:29:37.605
It wasn't in your lab, and it's not
in the prosecution's evidence.

00:29:39.335 --> 00:29:41.245
Well, I guess it got lost.

00:29:42.075 --> 00:29:44.015
It wouldn't be the first time
the police messed up, would it?

00:29:44.175 --> 00:29:46.545
The police don't make mistakes.
They just make things look like accidents.

00:29:46.975 --> 00:29:48.045
What do you mean by that?

00:29:51.185 --> 00:29:52.985
The fact that only that notebook
is missing...

00:29:54.385 --> 00:29:55.455
Don't you find that strange?

00:29:57.995 --> 00:29:59.555
What if the police and the prosecution...

00:30:01.265 --> 00:30:03.165
deliberately hid it?

00:30:05.565 --> 00:30:07.465
That would mean Prosecutor Cha
knew all along.

00:30:10.465 --> 00:30:12.675
So you're saying she knew about my cure...

00:30:13.505 --> 00:30:15.275
and was just putting on an act
to deceive me?

00:30:16.345 --> 00:30:18.375
What if... You and Prosecutor Cha...

00:30:20.245 --> 00:30:22.645
Wait, are you suspecting me?

00:30:23.085 --> 00:30:25.715
She's the one who was trying
to get me executed.

00:30:27.255 --> 00:30:28.425
For once...

00:30:29.155 --> 00:30:30.485
Just for once...

00:30:31.255 --> 00:30:32.525
I wish I could trust you.

00:30:32.855 --> 00:30:33.865
Unbelievable.

00:30:37.635 --> 00:30:41.805
The medical demonstration was a mockery
of Korea's justice system.

00:30:42.365 --> 00:30:44.475
The prosecution therefore
expresses its profound regret,

00:30:44.875 --> 00:30:47.345
and we vow to secure
the maximum possible sentence...

00:30:47.805 --> 00:30:51.045
to restore your sense of safety
in your daily lives.

00:30:52.575 --> 00:30:53.575
Yes.

00:30:53.645 --> 00:30:57.655
Some argue that allowing Lee Woo Gyeom
to continue experimenting on criminals...

00:30:57.785 --> 00:31:01.085
might actually make the public safer.

00:31:01.185 --> 00:31:02.825
Let's not muddy the waters.

00:31:03.655 --> 00:31:07.125
There can be no exceptions
when it comes to murder.

00:31:07.495 --> 00:31:08.495
Or am I wrong?

00:31:09.095 --> 00:31:12.095
Okay, that's all.
Please refer to the press release.

00:31:14.165 --> 00:31:15.365
What about his healing ability?

00:31:16.835 --> 00:31:19.975
What's your take on the demands to verify
Lee Woo Gyeom's healing ability?

00:31:22.145 --> 00:31:26.445
Let me ask you something.
If Lee Woo Gyeom murdered your relative,

00:31:26.715 --> 00:31:29.615
and the court was focused on verifying
that killer's so-called abilities,

00:31:30.085 --> 00:31:31.385
how would you feel?

00:31:33.155 --> 00:31:37.055
I think you're all getting confused by
Lee Woo Gyeom's manipulative games.

00:31:37.525 --> 00:31:40.665
A courtroom is a place to establish guilt,

00:31:42.465 --> 00:31:44.765
not where a defendant's abilities
are put on display.

00:31:46.365 --> 00:31:47.365
That is all.

00:31:48.365 --> 00:31:49.435
- Let's go.
- I have a question!

00:31:49.535 --> 00:31:51.605
- What will happen to the cure?
- About the medical demonstration...

00:31:51.675 --> 00:31:53.945
(The prosecution)

00:31:54.005 --> 00:31:56.305
(Guam District Prosecutors' Office)

00:31:56.375 --> 00:31:58.315
A medical demonstration?
What is this crap?

00:31:59.075 --> 00:32:00.945
The fact that he even revealed
his treatment method...

00:32:01.315 --> 00:32:02.785
means he must have something
up his sleeve.

00:32:04.215 --> 00:32:05.555
Something up his sleeve?

00:32:06.355 --> 00:32:09.455
Are you saying Lee Woo Gyeom can cure
incurable diseases or something?

00:32:11.025 --> 00:32:12.095
Keep a lid on this.

00:32:12.925 --> 00:32:16.065
Prosecutor Cha, you can't let the patient
undergo any other surgery.

00:32:16.565 --> 00:32:18.865
If it interferes with the procedure
that I was performing,

00:32:19.735 --> 00:32:21.265
he'll never recover.

00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:25.305
To be clear, you went to the hospital
only after Lee Woo Gyeom fully cured you?

00:32:25.705 --> 00:32:26.705
Yes.

00:32:27.105 --> 00:32:31.175
Your condition got worse
after resuming treatment at the hospital.

00:32:31.975 --> 00:32:33.515
Not because of Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:32:38.115 --> 00:32:39.185
About the Lee Woo Gyeom case...

00:32:39.555 --> 00:32:41.055
You know it was a shoddy investigation,
right?

00:32:41.825 --> 00:32:43.995
What? We caught the right guy.

00:32:44.055 --> 00:32:46.425
But you had no idea a cure even existed.

00:32:47.055 --> 00:32:49.725
Prosecutor Cha,
no one could've predicted that.

00:32:50.225 --> 00:32:53.695
Besides, the claim that Lee Woo Gyeom
was curing people...

00:32:53.765 --> 00:32:57.775
- No one would've believed it.
- That's what makes it shoddy.

00:32:57.975 --> 00:32:58.975
What?

00:32:59.035 --> 00:33:00.745
An investigation isn't just about
confirming what you believe.

00:33:00.805 --> 00:33:03.145
You also have to verify
why something might be false.

00:33:03.675 --> 00:33:06.915
The reporters are already sniffing around,
and if I turn my back on you too,

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.185
you'll be left high and dry,
Detective Gong.

00:33:16.355 --> 00:33:18.125
Prosecutor Cha,

00:33:19.025 --> 00:33:20.525
You're going to cooperate with me
all the way, right?

00:33:21.365 --> 00:33:22.565
Yes, of course.

00:33:23.325 --> 00:33:27.435
First, please confirm if there's someone
pulling the strings.

00:33:27.565 --> 00:33:29.605
Are you saying he had an accomplice?

00:33:30.305 --> 00:33:32.405
I don't know if it's an accomplice
or an associate.

00:33:33.035 --> 00:33:35.345
It's just that for him to create
the cure or the treatment...

00:33:35.675 --> 00:33:37.415
I find it hard to believe
he did it all by himself.

00:33:42.985 --> 00:33:44.055
Actually, Prosecutor Cha,

00:33:50.755 --> 00:33:53.325
This came up while I was reviewing
the CCTV footage from the arrest scene.

00:33:53.895 --> 00:33:55.995
It's too dark to make out a face, though.

00:33:56.565 --> 00:34:00.035
There is another CCTV camera
near the entrance, but it was broken.

00:34:00.535 --> 00:34:04.405
I sent the footage to forensics
to be restored. Once we get a face,

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:08.005
I'll start looking into
a possible accomplice as you suggested.

00:34:27.125 --> 00:34:29.625
Chief Bang, the visitor logs
for Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:34:29.695 --> 00:34:30.965
Please print out the entire list.

00:34:31.465 --> 00:34:33.095
What date range should I pull?

00:34:33.365 --> 00:34:36.835
- It's been a while since he was detained.
- From beginning to end, obviously.

00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:39.305
Right.

00:34:39.935 --> 00:34:44.315
Please secure all CCTV footage
within 500m of Lee Woo Gyeom's workshop.

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:47.945
- All of it?
- You can request it from Detective Gong.

00:34:48.445 --> 00:34:50.615
And pull three years of his
communication records too.

00:34:50.685 --> 00:34:52.355
All three years?

00:34:54.355 --> 00:34:55.355
Chief Bang.

00:34:57.155 --> 00:34:58.155
Chief Bang?

00:34:59.095 --> 00:35:01.095
Just until this case is wrapped up,

00:35:01.365 --> 00:35:05.495
for the sake of efficiency,
let's talk without any question marks.

00:35:07.635 --> 00:35:08.835
Yes, understood.

We broke two million views!
Man, how long has it been?

00:35:15.945 --> 00:35:18.315
Hey, this is huge! Huge!
Look at this! It's just shooting up!

00:35:20.445 --> 00:35:22.815
But public opinion is like a fad.

00:35:23.285 --> 00:35:24.985
You never know when
it's going to flip on you.

00:35:25.155 --> 00:35:29.155
Gosh, come on, Counselor.
Don't rain on our parade.

00:35:29.225 --> 00:35:31.495
- Goodness.
- Reporter Jo.

00:35:31.755 --> 00:35:32.755
Yes.

00:35:33.395 --> 00:35:35.425
- You did great work too.
- So did you.

00:35:35.865 --> 00:35:36.865
Goodness.

00:35:40.035 --> 00:35:41.035
By the way...

00:35:42.335 --> 00:35:44.475
When Lee Woo Gyeom was arrested,

00:35:45.105 --> 00:35:46.105
could he and Prosecutor Cha...

00:35:46.775 --> 00:35:48.605
have possibly struck a deal?

00:35:49.905 --> 00:35:51.175
No, there's no way.

00:35:52.415 --> 00:35:55.585
What if the Prosecution knew
about Lee Woo Gyeom's ability...

00:35:56.515 --> 00:35:58.155
before we did?

00:36:00.515 --> 00:36:03.155
You're thinking about
the missing evidence.

00:36:03.625 --> 00:36:04.625
That's right.

00:36:05.295 --> 00:36:08.125
And of all things, it had to be
his research notebook.

00:36:08.395 --> 00:36:10.495
But if the Prosecution already knew,

00:36:11.135 --> 00:36:12.965
would they have handled
the trial that way?

00:36:13.895 --> 00:36:14.905
Right, that's a good point.

00:36:16.335 --> 00:36:17.335
In that case...

00:36:18.105 --> 00:36:19.505
Besides the Prosecution...

00:36:20.605 --> 00:36:22.375
Does that mean
there's someone else involved?

00:36:23.605 --> 00:36:26.275
Lee Woo Gyeom woke up from a coma, right?

00:36:26.575 --> 00:36:29.745
Shouldn't there be someone who knew
about his physical condition back then?

00:36:34.925 --> 00:36:38.755
My doctor said my blood showed a different
mutational response than before, but...

00:36:39.655 --> 00:36:41.465
I couldn't just take his word for it.

00:36:42.395 --> 00:36:44.995
I was just an ordinary medical student,
after all.

00:37:07.015 --> 00:37:08.025
Hello?

00:37:08.585 --> 00:37:10.825
Yes. Is this Professor Han?

00:37:13.055 --> 00:37:15.765
Yes. I'm representing Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:37:16.395 --> 00:37:17.765
My name is Attorney Park Han Jun.

00:37:18.565 --> 00:37:20.065
I apologize for the sudden call,

00:37:20.665 --> 00:37:22.165
but I had something I needed to ask you.

00:37:23.035 --> 00:37:27.035
By any chance,
when Lee Woo Gyeom fell into a coma,

00:37:28.345 --> 00:37:30.175
you were in charge of his care, correct?

00:37:30.905 --> 00:37:34.615
- This is nice.
- The weather's great.

00:37:35.385 --> 00:37:37.045
- Hey.
- Yes?

00:37:37.115 --> 00:37:39.755
(Moral Cultivation)

00:37:39.855 --> 00:37:41.685
Hey, isn't that the guy?

00:37:42.425 --> 00:37:44.225
They say he only targeted and killed guys
with criminal records.

00:37:44.425 --> 00:37:46.255
Goodness. That's brutal.

00:37:46.725 --> 00:37:48.425
He only hunted down and killed
guys like us?

00:37:48.925 --> 00:37:52.065
- You punk? What do you mean "like us?"
- Hey, you fool!

00:37:52.595 --> 00:37:53.595
You little...

00:37:54.195 --> 00:37:57.005
Have you lost your darn mind
because I haven't beaten you up lately?

00:37:57.605 --> 00:37:58.605
I'm sorry.

00:38:02.605 --> 00:38:03.605
He's getting on my nerves.

00:38:04.545 --> 00:38:09.615
So annoying.
I can't stand that look on his face.

00:38:53.795 --> 00:38:54.795
Professor Han.

00:38:55.525 --> 00:38:56.965
I was told you discovered...

00:38:58.035 --> 00:39:00.195
a mutation in Lee Woo Gyeom's blood.

00:39:00.765 --> 00:39:01.965
It was just speculation,

00:39:02.465 --> 00:39:03.835
not a definitive diagnosis.

00:39:04.905 --> 00:39:05.905
So then,

00:39:06.705 --> 00:39:07.975
are you saying...

00:39:09.005 --> 00:39:10.405
Lee Woo Gyeom's cure is unstable?

00:39:10.745 --> 00:39:11.775
Of course.

00:39:12.775 --> 00:39:16.115
Administering it to a human subject
was impossible.

00:39:17.415 --> 00:39:18.655
Lee Woo Gyeom said...

00:39:20.355 --> 00:39:22.255
that to ensure its stability,

00:39:23.355 --> 00:39:26.225
he decided to run experiments,
and in the process...

00:39:27.225 --> 00:39:28.995
That's how there came to be victims.

00:39:30.065 --> 00:39:33.795
Counselor,
do you really think that's possible?

00:39:35.265 --> 00:39:36.265
Pardon?

00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:39.075
The blood therapy
that Woo Gyeom mentioned...

00:39:39.905 --> 00:39:41.875
hasn't even made it to clinical trials.

00:39:42.545 --> 00:39:43.805
For one medical student,

00:39:44.375 --> 00:39:45.415
all on his own,

00:39:46.045 --> 00:39:47.615
to create a viable treatment...

00:39:48.545 --> 00:39:50.285
Do you honestly believe that's possible?

00:39:51.045 --> 00:39:52.055
Still,

00:39:52.615 --> 00:39:55.355
I heard there was someone
who received the treatment.

00:39:57.125 --> 00:39:58.125
That's a lie.

00:39:59.795 --> 00:40:00.795
It's impossible.

00:40:04.695 --> 00:40:07.695
(Cheongun-ro 45-1)

00:40:42.365 --> 00:40:44.705
Yes, I've just checked it.

00:40:44.775 --> 00:40:45.775
(National Forensic Service)

00:40:48.775 --> 00:40:49.775
Right.

00:40:59.355 --> 00:41:00.385
(At this time,)

00:41:00.455 --> 00:41:02.555
(based on the suspect's blood sample,)

00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:04.255
(the "unique healing properties"
cannot be scientifically proven).

00:41:04.325 --> 00:41:06.755
Prosecutor.
Your sentencing recommendation, please.

00:41:07.525 --> 00:41:08.925
(Prosecution)

00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:10.595
Your Honor.

00:41:11.495 --> 00:41:13.135
While the focus of this hearing...

00:41:13.765 --> 00:41:15.505
may be to establish a motive,

00:41:16.165 --> 00:41:18.805
the defendant brutally murdered 17 people,

00:41:19.305 --> 00:41:22.705
and he is a serial killer
who shows not a shred of remorse.

00:41:24.045 --> 00:41:25.575
That is something we must never forget.

00:41:26.815 --> 00:41:27.885
We will now state our recommendation.

00:41:29.185 --> 00:41:30.185
The prosecution,

00:41:30.785 --> 00:41:35.725
contrary to claims, finds his blood has
only a negligible effect as a treatment...

00:41:36.185 --> 00:41:39.295
and is unsafe for therapeutic use,
according to the NFS.

00:41:40.055 --> 00:41:42.195
For the heinous criminal, Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:41:43.365 --> 00:41:44.535
we demand the death penalty.

00:41:53.605 --> 00:41:55.945
Counsel, you may present
your closing argument.

00:42:01.315 --> 00:42:02.315
Your Honor.

00:42:03.615 --> 00:42:06.155
Establishing motive reveals
the reason for a crime...

00:42:06.215 --> 00:42:09.085
and is a crucial step
in determining the sentence.

00:42:10.285 --> 00:42:12.825
However, the prosecution...

00:42:13.825 --> 00:42:14.865
has ignored this fact...

00:42:16.095 --> 00:42:17.965
and tried to pigeonhole the defendant,
Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:42:18.065 --> 00:42:21.805
as a random serial killer.

00:42:23.005 --> 00:42:24.005
In the past, the defendant...

00:42:25.035 --> 00:42:27.505
lived in constant pain
as the victim of a car accident,

00:42:28.575 --> 00:42:32.575
and we learned he committed these crimes
while developing a treatment...

00:42:33.245 --> 00:42:35.615
for patients suffering just as he was.

00:42:36.115 --> 00:42:40.615
Contrary to the NFS opinion
submitted by the prosecution,

00:42:41.455 --> 00:42:43.325
we have a report from the
American Blood Association...

00:42:44.225 --> 00:42:46.525
suggesting that defendant Lee Woo Gyeom's
treatment...

00:42:47.025 --> 00:42:48.925
could have been beneficial
to the witnesses.

00:42:49.395 --> 00:42:50.395
Thus, we ask not for the death penalty,

00:42:50.795 --> 00:42:55.365
but for the most lenient sentence.
Lastly, to be considered in your judgment,

00:42:56.465 --> 00:42:58.335
we request a medical demonstration.

00:43:00.375 --> 00:43:01.375
The defense rests.

00:43:17.285 --> 00:43:20.925
Sentencing will be held at a later date.

00:43:34.005 --> 00:43:37.375
Min Seo, how about we go out
with Dad this weekend?

00:43:41.445 --> 00:43:42.445
Min Seo.

00:43:45.555 --> 00:43:46.555
Min Seo.

00:43:50.025 --> 00:43:51.025
Min Seo?

00:43:51.895 --> 00:43:53.925
Mom, I'm sleepy.

00:43:56.165 --> 00:43:57.165
You are.

00:43:57.795 --> 00:44:00.195
Let's lie down. Okay, up we go.

00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:14.615
Gosh, I'm gonna get a heat rash from this.

00:44:15.785 --> 00:44:19.255
Darn. This is no day
to be working outside.

00:44:20.155 --> 00:44:21.155
Goodness.

00:44:21.785 --> 00:44:22.785
Gosh, look at all this sweat.

00:44:25.595 --> 00:44:27.695
Man, it's so damn hard to make a living.

00:44:28.925 --> 00:44:29.925
Goodness.

00:44:31.735 --> 00:44:32.735
Man, this is exhausting.

00:44:46.145 --> 00:44:48.445
(Defendant)

00:44:54.685 --> 00:44:55.685
Before I deliver the sentence,

00:44:56.385 --> 00:44:59.395
regarding the conflicting analysis results
presented by both sides,

00:44:59.995 --> 00:45:02.325
my judgment was based on what is in
the public's best interest.

00:45:03.565 --> 00:45:06.665
This decision was not based on
the treatment analysis alone,

00:45:07.095 --> 00:45:09.235
but on the facts revealed
over the course of the trial,

00:45:09.765 --> 00:45:11.005
the defendant's attitude,

00:45:11.505 --> 00:45:14.435
and the consistency of the testimonies.

00:45:16.305 --> 00:45:17.575
I will now deliver the sentence.

00:45:18.175 --> 00:45:21.785
The defense has argued
that the defendant...

00:45:22.185 --> 00:45:26.585
created and administered a treatment
in an attempt to save sick people.

00:45:26.985 --> 00:45:28.385
In reviewing this argument,

00:45:29.225 --> 00:45:33.225
based on analysis of the genetic variant
found in the defendant's blood...

00:45:39.665 --> 00:45:42.565
The verdict in the first trial
of killer Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:45:42.565 --> 00:45:44.105
is about to be announced.

00:45:44.165 --> 00:45:45.605
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:45:45.675 --> 00:45:47.575
- He looks like someone who lives here.
- Does he?

00:45:48.275 --> 00:45:49.275
Thank you.

00:45:50.305 --> 00:45:51.405
Citing the American
Blood Association's opinion...

00:45:51.915 --> 00:45:54.915
that this mutated blood
is a significant factor...

00:45:55.285 --> 00:45:56.685
in proving his treatment hypothesis...

00:45:57.415 --> 00:45:59.815
and can affect the treatment of diseases,

00:45:59.985 --> 00:46:02.525
the court has taken this into account.

00:46:03.185 --> 00:46:05.525
The court accepts that
his motive for the crime...

00:46:05.925 --> 00:46:08.265
was to treat sick people.

00:46:13.795 --> 00:46:16.305
Breaking news. In the final verdict
of the first-instance trial,

00:46:16.365 --> 00:46:19.035
the court has accepted
Lee Woo Gyeom's motive for the crime.

00:46:21.605 --> 00:46:22.745
This was hard to get.

00:46:31.315 --> 00:46:33.185
Lee Woo Gyeom killed my brother?

00:46:38.155 --> 00:46:40.625
The court accepts that
his motive for the crime...

00:46:41.025 --> 00:46:43.465
- was to treat sick people.
- Right?

00:46:44.365 --> 00:46:46.835
However, Lee Woo Gyeom's blood...

00:46:47.335 --> 00:46:50.465
is far too unsafe
to be used as a treatment,

00:46:50.705 --> 00:46:55.445
and as the NFS deems it inadmissible
as evidence of his treatments,

00:46:55.675 --> 00:46:59.945
this court,
while acknowledging his motive,

00:47:00.315 --> 00:47:05.055
cannot accept the claim
that he actually cured the witnesses.

00:47:05.585 --> 00:47:06.585
Goodness.

00:47:08.985 --> 00:47:09.985
Anyone here?

00:47:22.335 --> 00:47:23.335
Darn it...

00:47:26.235 --> 00:47:30.475
