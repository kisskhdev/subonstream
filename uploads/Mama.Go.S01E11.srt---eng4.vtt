00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:45.240
Xiaocan

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.640
Why are you alone? Where's Xurui?

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:50.799
She... she had something to do and left early.

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:53.679
What could she possibly have to do this late?

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:56.000
Did you make her angry again?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.640
It's just... she...

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.000
Fang'er

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.359
Nianqing

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.960
Xiaoyin

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.920
Fang'er

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.079
What ride made you cry like this?

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.959
Li Wai

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.480
Did you bully her again?

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.760
Xiaoyin, be good, don't cry.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.959
It's just a breakup, isn't it?

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.719
It's no big deal.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.760
Can't let it ruin our fun.

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:15.680
I want to keep partying.

00:01:15.879 --> 00:01:16.280
Party!

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:19.239
Move out of the way.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.680
Keep partying!

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.120
Party!

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.680
Let's go, next one!

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.120
Let's go!

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:00.560
Let's go, next one!

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.959
Let's go!

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:19.240
I'm okay now, Fang'er.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.639
I'm okay.

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:21.919
If you're good, I'm good.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.719
That was thrilling!

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.599
Thrilling! Awesome!

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:24.400
Awesome!

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.680
You guys spent quite a lot today.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.639
This is a gift for you.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:29.240
It's so cute!

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.360
It's so big!

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.960
Such a big dog!

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.800
So cute! So cute!

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.520
I didn't expect to get a doll just for playing games

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:47.479
It's so much fun

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.520
I should recommend Sister Niu and the others come play sometime

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.840
I used to think that

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:52.520
this kind of doll

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.000
was only for kids to play with

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.240
But now, I realize how cute it is

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.479
Look at this big nose

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:57.439
And these big ears

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.120
If I put this in the bedroom

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:00.360
I'll put it in my room

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.879
And I'll put it right on my bed

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.759
I can hug it while I sleep at night

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.360
Wait

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.960
That's too

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.680
Something isn't right

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:07.240
What's not right?

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.159
I felt something was off when I left the house today

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.520
My right eyelid kept twitching

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.039
Now I understand

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.039
What? What do you understand now?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.639
These tickets

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.759
Wei Mingtian's agent gave them to you, right?

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.960
Why give them to you?

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.000
Okay then

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.199
After giving them to you

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.840
If you hadn't called us along today

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:23.759
wouldn't it just be

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.560
you and Wei Mingtian here alone

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:26.960
catching big dogs?

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.360
Sitting right here

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:28.960
It would just be you and Wei Mingtian, right?

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.240
What are we doing here?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.639
And you

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.680
You didn't know?

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:36.240
Let me tell you, I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.800
You're something else, Mom

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.439
I was guarding against fire, electricity, and Li Wai

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.000
I never expected

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:43.240
I'd overlook this little weakling

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:44.520
I treat this kid like a brother

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.159
And he wants to be my stepdad

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.400
I'm telling you, I don't agree to this

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.360
Wait a minute, wait a minute

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.840
If you had this kind of logic

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.360
why don't you use it on your studies?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.960
Wouldn't you have passed Physics long ago?

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.639
And your Chinese

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.680
I'm telling you, your essays would get full marks

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:56.919
Your eyes just darted away, Mom

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.159
You looked away

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:59.560
You're guilty. You're panicking

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.319
You didn't know about this?

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.400
Let me tell you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.199
There is absolutely nothing going on between him and me

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.759
He... he's just a kid, you know?

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:08.879
What could possibly be going on?

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.080
You're nervous

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.080
Me, nervous?

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:13.319
Mom, I've never seen you this nervous

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.319
I'm not nervous

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.960
Look, look at you

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.400
I'm not

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:16.480
I'm telling you

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.439
I absolutely do not agree

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:18.160
I've hidden the household register

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160
Agree? Do I need your agreement?

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.000
Don't you pull that on me

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.079
Don't give me that "acting young at your age" stuff

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:21.600
What "acting young"?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.560
I'm telling you, you'll lose your dignity in your old age

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.240
Mom, I definitely can't accept it

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.839
If you have time to think about this

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:25.120
you should think about you and Xurui

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.120
I'm not arguing with you

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.600
We'll have a good talk when we get home

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.279
Just you wait

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:34.879
This luggage is too big

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:35.759
You have to buy an extra ticket

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.040
What?

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.040
No...

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.000
Sir

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.759
This... this is a toy

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:41.639
It doesn't take up a seat

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:42.600
It's too bulky

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:43.040
Fine, fine, fine

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.720
No, can't I just hold it? I'll buy...

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.040
I'll buy one ticket, just one is enough

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:46.199
Get on

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:49.560
You have serious issues

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:51.240
You made me dodge fares when I was taller than that thing

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.720
And now you

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:52.879
You've got big problems, let me tell you

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:53.399
Come on up, come on up

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:01.120
Xiao Zhang

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.360
Coming, Sister Niu

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.519
Give me a millet porridge

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.240
I... I'll wait in line

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.519
Okay, okay, okay

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.800
Give me a beef patty

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.720
Morning

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.600
Morning

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.720
Two beef patties and one purple rice porridge

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.000
Okay, ten yuan

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:13.439
Okay, okay

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.680
Paid

00:05:16.959 --> 00:05:17.399
Alright

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.120
Look at my bag

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.079
Does it look good?

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:23.240
It's pretty nice

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.079
Let me tell you

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:25.160
I got this for free

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:26.759
I won it at the amusement park

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:28.360
That place is really fun

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.319
You should go check it out

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.519
That's a place for you kids to play

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:32.959
No, no

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.519
It has nothing to do with being a kid

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.279
I'm telling you, you have to go see for yourself

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:39.199
You'll feel really different if you go

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:40.240
I'm not lying

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:42.319
Here, beef patties are ready

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.040
Thanks

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.959
Careful, it's hot

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:45.160
Here

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.240
Purple rice porridge

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.959
Take this

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.199
Don't just eat millet porridge in the morning

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:49.959
Eat a bit more

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:50.759
I'm off, Sister Niu

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:51.519
Bye, Sister Zhang

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.079
Who... who is that?

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.040
You don't know her?

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:00.399
No, she just looks a bit familiar

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:01.720
But why did she...

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:03.920
Just eat it if she gave it to you

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.600
The library automation system...

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.000
is something that, with the development of social production,

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:11.639
and science and technology,

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:13.920
especially computer technology,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.560
and the progress of communication technology,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.720
came into being

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.720
Come to the campus cafe after class

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.040
We need to clear up what wasn't explained at the amusement park

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:23.319
Some libraries in North America and the UK...

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.839
...began conducting...

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:26.319
...computer application experiments

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.360
Okay, no problem

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.519
By the mid-sixties...

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.319
By the mid-sixties...

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.720
Xurui asked me out

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.319
Is it really such a turnaround?

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:39.560
Today

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:41.800
Cloudy turning to overcast

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.079
Dark clouds gathering

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:46.839
Sudden strong winds

00:06:49.079 --> 00:06:50.079
It is the perfect day for two old flames

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.759
to break up

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.480
Will ex-boyfriend Kong Xiaocan

00:06:58.199 --> 00:06:59.519
and ex-girlfriend Lin Xurui

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:02.920
please change each other's WeChat aliases

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:04.959
and profile pictures

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.360
My profile picture...

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.839
Just from the angle of the photo...

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.199
Doesn't it look quite classy?

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.240
Do you think I should...

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.079
Change it? Change it a bit.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:30.079
Change it. Better to change it back.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:31.920
Changed. Done.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:32.639
Done.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.160
Now that it's changed...

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.480
Please hand your phones to the witness.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:39.839
Changed it.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:43.560
Changed mine too.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.160
Alright, alright.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.879
So, next...

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.399
Would the two of you...

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:50.600
Return each other's gifts.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.160
The... the clothes and stuff you bought me before...

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:01.000
They actually look pretty good.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.519
I couldn't have picked them out with my taste.

00:08:02.759 --> 00:08:04.040
How about I pay you cash for them?

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.680
Fine, fine. Take it.

00:08:06.959 --> 00:08:08.519
I can't use this either. You take it.

00:08:08.519 --> 00:08:09.040
Kong Xiaocan.

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:09.360
Okay.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.319
Mr. Kong Xiaocan.

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:16.759
From now on...

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:19.920
Whether this lady becomes beautiful or thin...

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:21.399
Succeeds in her career...

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.759
Or her family gets a demolition payout...

00:08:23.639 --> 00:08:26.079
It will have absolutely nothing to do with you.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.680
May I ask...

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:29.120
Do you accept?

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.039
I do.

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:53.559
Ms. Lin Xurui.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:54.799
From now on...

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:57.200
Whether he becomes tall or handsome...

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:58.639
Emotionally stable...

00:08:58.879 --> 00:08:59.720
Understanding...

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.960
It will have nothing to do with you.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:03.480
May I ask...

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.000
I do.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.159
Since you both accept...

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.200
I now pronounce...

00:09:19.919 --> 00:09:20.639
You two...

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:24.080
Officially broken up.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.600
Now...

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.600
You may now slap this gentleman...

00:09:38.039 --> 00:09:38.639
...in the face.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.039
It's okay. It's fine, it's fine.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.399
That was way too hard!

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.799
It's out of respect for our past.

00:09:53.279 --> 00:09:54.320
Starting today...

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.120
I don't care what else you're hiding from me.

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.720
It's all in the past.

00:09:58.159 --> 00:09:59.320
Let's pretend we never dated.

00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.320
And go back to being friends.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.519
You're way too harsh on your friends.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.639
Uh, um, well...

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.399
You... you two are done with this business today, right?

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.240
It wasn't easy getting dressed up like this.

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.440
So I'm killing two birds with one stone.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:13.639
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

00:10:13.799 --> 00:10:14.360
Where are you going?

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.519
On a blind date.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.559
I like... yellow.

00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:45.200
Passion.

00:10:46.559 --> 00:10:48.480
Doesn't Li Wai have a crush on your mom?

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.279
He got over it that fast?

00:10:50.279 --> 00:10:51.799
Okay, okay, let's not bring that up again.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:52.559
It makes me sick just thinking about it.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.600
Do you know Zarathustra?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.559
He said something really good.

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.480
Only those who know where they are headed...

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:06.000
...know which wind is favorable.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.200
That is their tailwind.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.480
All joy...

00:11:08.799 --> 00:11:11.519
...wants the eternity of all things.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.360
That's so weird.

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:25.399
I can't believe he agreed to a blind date.

00:11:26.159 --> 00:11:27.480
He's been a free spirit since he was a kid.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:29.200
His parents wouldn't arrange this either.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.440
And look at that girl.

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.559
She looks like an independent woman.

00:11:32.279 --> 00:11:34.360
And she looks classy too. Looks...

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:38.399
Of course, she's nowhere near as good as you.

00:11:38.559 --> 00:11:39.679
No, I mean...

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.559
She looks like she has good prospects.

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:43.240
There's no way she'd like a goofball like Li Wai.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:44.480
Right?

00:11:55.519 --> 00:11:57.000
Miss, let me tell you the truth.

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.559
I'm not the person you're supposed to meet.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.480
That guy is no good.

00:12:00.759 --> 00:12:02.120
He hired me to act crazy and drive you away.

00:12:02.559 --> 00:12:04.480
But I don't know how to act crazy, right?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.120
Look, you're such a catch.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.919
Age anxiety isn't a problem.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.480
Why are you in such a rush to get married?

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.200
Miss, you've misunderstood.

00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:15.600
I'm not what you think.

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:19.600
I'm not a bad person.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.320
You... believe me, I didn't...

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.399
Get in here!

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:27.320
Police!

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.240
Squat down!

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.720
All men, don't move!

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.639
Squat down!

00:12:35.039 --> 00:12:35.759
Police business!

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:37.960
No need to be afraid, everyone.

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:39.840
You're all here for matchmaking, right?

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:40.759
Yes.

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.639
These men...

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.000
...are shills arranged by the matchmaking agency.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.279
For a female user's first date after registering...

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.679
...the website arranges a meeting with...

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:50.480
...a man who looks pretty decent.

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.399
The site claims he's not interested in you...

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.120
...and suggests you buy a Gold Membership.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.480
But after you pay...

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.320
...you end up seeing these...

00:12:57.919 --> 00:12:59.279
...men acting crazy and stupid.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.320
Since the website arranged a meeting...

00:13:01.399 --> 00:13:02.720
...service has technically been provided.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:04.120
So you can't request a refund.

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:05.720
Simply put...

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:07.159
...you've all been scammed.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:08.159
Alright.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:09.200
Take them all away.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.919
Miss Officer, I'm not a scammer.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.679
I'm not what you think, Miss Officer.

00:13:14.039 --> 00:13:14.480
Miss Officer!

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:15.360
Miss Officer!

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:16.120
Miss... Miss Officer!

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:18.759
I... I want to ask for leave from school, Miss Officer.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.919
Can I ask for leave from school, Miss Officer?

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:23.799
This is Upland cotton.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:25.159
Sea Island cotton.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.759
Asian cotton, Levant cotton.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.879
Everyone, observe carefully...

00:13:28.879 --> 00:13:30.600
...the morphological characteristics of different cotton species.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.639
Find the patterns to distinguish them.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:35.960
Isn't this all just cotton?

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.720
What exactly is different?

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:39.519
I can't look anymore.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:40.519
I'm going blind.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.480
No need to rush, everyone.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.879
You can try drawing them.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.679
Drawing is a necessary skill for agriculture students.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.159
Sit closer if you can't see. Next time...

00:13:53.039 --> 00:13:54.559
...don't squint. I won't bite.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:55.440
Come here.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.519
You draw really well.

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:06.399
Take a look, everyone.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:08.840
Student Gui Fang found the differences.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.240
The leaves and veins are very different.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:14.080
Can you see it?

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.480
You're right.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.080
Look at the diagram again.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.759
You can see the difference now, right?

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.159
You're quite talented.

00:14:21.519 --> 00:14:22.480
That's amazing.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.120
Gui Fang, you draw so well.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.200
Can you teach me?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.120
Is... is it really that good?

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:30.639
Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:30.639 --> 00:14:32.480
You have such a talent for drawing.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.559
Gui Fang, can you teach me how to draw the rhizomes?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.039
My lab report requires us to draw the growth stage.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.879
How do I draw that?

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.080
I was first.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:40.320
Gui Fang.

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.559
Is this a bag?

00:14:41.559 --> 00:14:42.600
It's so cute.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.159
I won it at the amusement park.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:46.080
You're amazing. Fang and I caught it together.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:46.600
Gui Fang.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:47.240
Amazing.

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.360
You're so amazing.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.159
Did you crochet this cup holder yourself?

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200
You are just too incredible.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.279
Is there anything you can't do?

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:53.960
Exactly.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960
Alright, alright, classmates.

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:57.120
Give our Gui Fang some space.

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:58.480
Don't all crowd around here.

00:14:58.679 --> 00:14:59.840
Let our Fang rest for a bit.

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.440
I also have Gui Fang's class notes here.

00:15:02.639 --> 00:15:04.600
Gui Fang said whoever needs them can ask me.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.159
Who wants them?

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.960
I do! Me, me, me!

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:07.720
I'll lend them to you.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.320
Thanks.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.120
So... so Gui Fang...

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.279
Can we borrow this to make a copy?

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:12.919
Sure, sure.

00:15:13.159 --> 00:15:14.399
You can all take it to copy.

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:16.879
It's so good to have you in our class.

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:18.080
We're leaving now. Bye-bye.

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.360
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.240
Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.320
Focus on your studies from now on.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.480
We can't do things that break the law.

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:56.679
Don't worry, Miss Officer.

00:15:56.679 --> 00:15:57.440
I won't dare do it again.

00:15:58.039 --> 00:15:59.240
H-How is it? What's the situation?

00:15:59.799 --> 00:16:00.960
Is this the blind date you talked about?

00:16:01.759 --> 00:16:02.240
No.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.600
My cousin didn't want to come to the blind date himself.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.159
So I came in his place.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.679
You know how my aunt is.

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:09.559
She believes anything.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.440
She got scammed by a fraud ring.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:14.200
Miss Officer.

00:16:14.279 --> 00:16:15.639
My cousin is actually quite handsome.

00:16:15.639 --> 00:16:16.279
About the same as me.

00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:17.320
How about I send you his WeChat?

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:18.240
Put that away right now.

00:16:18.399 --> 00:16:18.919
Officer.

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.759
So he's really okay, right?

00:16:21.039 --> 00:16:21.399
He's fine.

00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:22.360
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.879
Are you two both his friends?

00:16:24.159 --> 00:16:24.720
Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:26.960
Are you busy later?

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:28.440
If not...

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.000
Could you help us film an anti-fraud promo video?

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.240
Sure.

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:32.960
No problem, we can do it.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.639
M-Miss Officer.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:34.600
If you need anything...

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:35.600
We can help anytime.

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:37.120
Alright then.

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:39.159
Then you play the scammer who cheats people.

00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:41.519
You two play the victims.

00:16:43.759 --> 00:16:44.480
You won't do it for free.

00:16:44.759 --> 00:16:46.159
After filming, everyone gets a bag of rice.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.399
Deal.

00:16:48.879 --> 00:16:49.600
Scammer it is.

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:51.600
I didn't think I was suitable at first.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.000
You're quite suitable.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:55.519
Really looks like one.

00:17:02.639 --> 00:17:04.079
Thanks for your hard work today.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:04.599
No problem.

00:17:04.599 --> 00:17:05.720
You even gave us gifts.

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.400
Thank you, thank you.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.200
Go home early for dinner.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:07.920
Okay, okay.

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:08.519
You.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.319
Study hard from now on.

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:10.960
Don't forget.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:11.960
Got it, Miss Officer.

00:17:12.799 --> 00:17:13.599
Come visit often.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.079
Let's go, let's go. Okay.

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:15.960
That was terrible acting.

00:17:16.039 --> 00:17:16.759
It was indeed pretty average.

00:17:16.799 --> 00:17:18.039
But you acted really well, Xurui.

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.720
You're photogenic. Your acting was average too.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.559
Why do I feel like after your amicable breakup...

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:23.640
...your relationship is better than before?

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:26.039
Mom.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:27.640
You're back.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.839
There's great news today.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.519
We don't need to buy rice for a while.

00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:31.920
Let me tell you.

00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:32.759
Thanks to Li Wai.

00:17:32.759 --> 00:17:33.400
They sent it over.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:34.160
Where are you?

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:36.279
Mom.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:40.200
Mom.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.640
You scared me.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.039
You scared me. What are you doing?

00:17:46.359 --> 00:17:47.400
You didn't make a sound.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.920
I've been calling you the whole time.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.279
I said...

00:17:49.279 --> 00:17:50.480
Didn't hear you. I was listening to music.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.000
Got some rice. It was a gift.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.440
It's really good.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.720
No need to buy rice lately. Saved money.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.559
Perfect timing. We were just out of rice.

00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.359
This drawing...

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.559
How is it?

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.519
It looks just like it.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.480
Missing a bit of soul.

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.119
I didn't draw this well.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.200
It looks pretty similar.

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.319
What... what does this painting mean?

00:18:18.319 --> 00:18:19.240
Did our home change styles?

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:20.240
How is it?

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.079
Do you like it?

00:18:23.079 --> 00:18:23.480
Wait a minute.

00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:25.200
What does this mean?

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.359
Are you hinting at me?

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:27.400
No, isn't it just...

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.799
I won't go to the snow mountain again. I'm not lying.

00:18:29.799 --> 00:18:30.960
You don't have to hang me up like a pillar of shame.

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.000
Isn't this mocking me?

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:34.559
This is a promise between you and me.

00:18:35.799 --> 00:18:36.880
When you graduate,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.440
Mom will go help you fulfill your dream.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.000
Go to the snow mountain with you.

00:18:41.799 --> 00:18:43.160
It's just that lately,

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:44.680
I've figured things out myself.

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:46.440
You know, in this life,

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.960
you have to achieve something.

00:18:48.359 --> 00:18:49.839
You have to please yourself.

00:18:50.799 --> 00:18:52.359
That kind of excitement,

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.039
that drive for life.

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:57.519
If you really like traveling,

00:18:57.839 --> 00:18:58.960
then from now on, Mom...

00:18:59.079 --> 00:19:00.119
Mom won't stop you anymore.

00:19:00.279 --> 00:19:01.599
Mom will go with you to make it happen.

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:04.000
Did you...

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.559
plan some kind of conspiracy?

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:06.599
Are you trying to trick me?

00:19:07.359 --> 00:19:08.359
I've already hung the painting up.

00:19:08.359 --> 00:19:09.440
Would I lie to you?

00:19:11.039 --> 00:19:13.839
Before, I was always pretending to be young.

00:19:15.039 --> 00:19:16.240
But ever since that time,

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.960
after going to the amusement park with you guys,

00:19:18.319 --> 00:19:18.960
you know what?

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.720
I really found that feeling of being young.

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:25.319
That feeling that the future has many possibilities.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.160
Anyway, I haven't been to a snow mountain either.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.000
Let's go see it together.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:30.480
I didn't expect that.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.480
This amusement park had such a therapeutic effect on you.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.960
If I knew, we would've gone sooner.

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:36.160
Young people also love clubbing.

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.119
I'll take you clubbing in a couple of days.

00:19:37.359 --> 00:19:38.599
What clubbing? Eat.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:39.880
I see this...

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:40.759
painting...

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.559
It's pretty good. Looks quite like it.

00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.359
It's not very realistic. It lacks a bit of soul.

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.559
What is this?

00:19:48.559 --> 00:19:49.359
This... this...

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:50.799
It's a draft.

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:52.279
It's clumsy. Looking at it, I...

00:19:52.279 --> 00:19:53.000
No way.

00:19:53.079 --> 00:19:54.400
It's good. Definitely clumsy. It's not finished yet.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:55.640
Wait until I finish it.

00:19:55.839 --> 00:19:56.759
Finished without a neck?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.799
It's not finished!

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:59.839
Blame the teacher for running late.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.079
There are no seats left in the cafeteria.

00:20:02.279 --> 00:20:02.759
Just right.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.680
I can eat with my digital side dish.

00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:07.559
Fang, do you know?

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.319
You've become a god in everyone's hearts now.

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:11.039
A top student.

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.319
It's not that exaggerated.

00:20:13.319 --> 00:20:14.200
You don't know?

00:20:14.599 --> 00:20:16.039
There are posts about you on the BOT.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.720
Look.

00:20:20.279 --> 00:20:20.960
BOT

00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:21.920
Read my lips.

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:23.519
BOT.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:24.519
BOT.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.279
It's from our school.

00:20:25.279 --> 00:20:26.400
Called Duda Gossip BOT.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.880
This one. You don't follow it?

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.200
Lots of schools have one.

00:20:30.359 --> 00:20:32.200
Like interesting news and stories from campus.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.720
Confessions and gossip all get posted there.

00:20:34.079 --> 00:20:34.640
You could say...

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.000
this Duda Gossip BOT...

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.720
is the primary source for campus gossip.

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.440
But I still prefer...

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.559
reading gossip from other schools.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:42.079
It's far removed from me.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:43.519
So following the drama feels less burdensome.

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.279
Which one do you follow?

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:46.960
Is there any juicy gossip lately?

00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:48.519
Just this Polytech BOT.

00:20:48.759 --> 00:20:49.839
A Chinese department professor...

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.400
married a guy ten years younger.

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:52.559
What's so strange about that?

00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:53.559
What's trending now...

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:55.359
is the older-woman relationship.

00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:57.319
I didn't realize...

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:59.039
you were into that.

00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:03.000
So you guys don't think a woman being much older...

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:03.960
is weird?

00:21:04.599 --> 00:21:05.279
Why would it be weird?

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.400
What's weird about it?

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:07.599
Only older men with young wives are allowed?

00:21:07.599 --> 00:21:08.559
But not older women with young husbands?

00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:09.640
What kind of thinking is that?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:10.640
Feudal. Exactly.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:11.599
That's so feudal.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.000
I really haven't thought about that.

00:21:14.599 --> 00:21:16.000
My life goal...

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.240
is to be a cool, independent woman.

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.000
Like Puppy-like guys, Wolf-like guys, Down-to-earth guys...

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.200
I'm fine with any of them.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.000
Down-to-earth guy?

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.279
What kind of younger guy is that?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:28.799
Down-to-earth guy...

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:39.839
No, no.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.680
What am I thinking?

00:22:11.759 --> 00:22:12.960
Yes, very good.

00:22:14.279 --> 00:22:16.119
Lu Jie, could you lean on Xiaotian a bit more?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Yes, yes, very good.

00:22:19.079 --> 00:22:19.480
Lower.

00:22:26.359 --> 00:22:27.599
Great work, Lu Jie. Have some fruit.

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:28.240
Thanks.

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.799
Lu Jie, your phone.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.400
Thanks.

00:22:31.519 --> 00:22:31.920
Lu Jie.

00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:32.920
Our staff members...

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.160
...want to take a photo and get an autograph.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:34.960
Sure, come here.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:36.680
Hello, Lu Jie.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:37.640
I've liked you for a long time.

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:38.400
Can I take a photo with you?

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:38.880
Sure, okay.

00:22:39.680 --> 00:22:40.000
All right.

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:41.519
Thank you, thank you.

00:22:41.759 --> 00:22:42.480
Thanks! Thank you, Lu Jie.

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.319
Lu Jie.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.640
Please sign these for the fans.

00:22:46.319 --> 00:22:46.680
Here.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.400
Come here. Come.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.400
Come over here.

00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:49.079
Sit here.

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:52.720
Do you know how much money...

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.119
...and effort I spent to get you here...

00:22:54.119 --> 00:22:55.240
...to shoot a commercial with Lu Jie?

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.119
Do you think it's just about shooting a commercial?

00:22:57.759 --> 00:22:59.319
You have to know how to leech.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:01.240
That's not very good, is it?

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:02.839
What's not good about it?

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.279
Everyone climbs up by leeching.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:04.920
She did too.

00:23:05.839 --> 00:23:06.440
Let me tell you.

00:23:06.599 --> 00:23:08.200
Be a bit more enthusiastic now.

00:23:08.599 --> 00:23:09.599
Build a good relationship.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.440
She... the way she is now...

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:12.799
...she likes fresh meat like you.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.480
Do you understand?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.960
If you two could stir up some scandal...

00:23:16.119 --> 00:23:17.240
...even if you can't stir up a scandal...

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:18.920
...hyping up a couple image works too.

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:20.799
I know you have mental barriers.

00:23:21.519 --> 00:23:22.319
Lu Jie is getting old.

00:23:22.799 --> 00:23:24.480
She can't compare to those young girls.

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.200
But...

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:26.039
...but, you see...

00:23:26.319 --> 00:23:28.319
...she still has connections and resources.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.319
Right now, we are...

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:32.319
...climbing up on the shoulders of a giant.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.680
She can help you right now.

00:23:34.359 --> 00:23:35.720
But you're developing so fast...

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.319
...in a couple of days, she might not be able to help.

00:23:37.599 --> 00:23:38.440
Be more enthusiastic.

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:40.279
You know to greet people when you see them, right?

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720
Like this, like this. Let's practice.

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.039
Let's say...

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.319
...let's say Lu Jie...

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.279
...just walked in through this door.

00:23:46.519 --> 00:23:47.960
Then you shout, "Hello, Lu Jie."

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:48.839
Come on, try it once.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.680
Lu... Lu... Hello, Lu Jie.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.400
Oh my god, this kid.

00:23:54.799 --> 00:23:56.039
Are you meeting the Dean of Students?

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.160
Lu-Lu... Hello, Lu Jie.

00:23:58.599 --> 00:23:59.039
Come, come, come.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:00.599
Watch me. I'll teach you. I'll teach you.

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.720
You have to... be a bit... a bit...

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:03.759
...that kind of...

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:05.319
...emotion. Like...

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.279
Lu...

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400
No, that... that's too greasy.

00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:08.200
Lu Jie.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:08.680
No, no.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.359
You... use your...

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.960
...biggest advantage is purity.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.720
Hello, Lu Jie.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.400
Hello, Lu Jie.

00:24:12.519 --> 00:24:13.079
Hello, Lu Jie.

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.759
Hello, Lu Jie.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.240
Yes, just like that. I think that works.

00:24:16.119 --> 00:24:16.759
I don't think so.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:17.720
You don't think so?

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:18.759
Then you...

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:28.519
Lu Jie.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.319
Is it possible that...

00:24:31.319 --> 00:24:31.920
...what I just said...

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.039
...you just pretend you didn't hear?

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:37.119
I want to hear something else.

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.920
Want to hear something else?

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.240
Sure, sure.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.640
Xiaotian can... can can can...

00:24:42.839 --> 00:24:43.920
...sing, dance, and rap.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.519
I want...

00:24:47.559 --> 00:24:48.480
...to hear a sound.

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:49.319
A sound?

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.440
What does that mean?

00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:19.960
Maizi, no need to see me off.

00:25:20.359 --> 00:25:21.440
Go back and rest your injury.

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:22.839
Bye, Maizi.

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:23.759
Bye.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.640
Listen, you must be careful.

00:26:20.039 --> 00:26:21.519
Didn't we agree to be friends?

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.359
Why are you now

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.079
avoiding me again?

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.279
Yes.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.240
I am avoiding you.

00:26:31.759 --> 00:26:32.880
I was afraid you'd feel awkward.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.839
If you're awkward, I'm awkward.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.799
Then we'll both be awkward.

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:40.079
I know.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.839
You've already clearly rejected me.

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.880
You can lead a horse to water,

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:46.279
but you can't make it drink.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:48.680
You don't like me.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:49.759
I accept that.

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:52.160
But I don't want just because of

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.319
"I like you,"

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.720
we can't even be friends in the end.

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.759
Feelings aren't like training a dog.

00:26:58.279 --> 00:26:59.119
Go on command,

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.119
stop on command.

00:27:00.799 --> 00:27:02.319
I also need time to adjust.

00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:04.359
To slowly go back to being friends.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:06.119
Before that,

00:27:07.279 --> 00:27:08.359
can you not leave yet?

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:10.799
Can we still be friends?

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.480
Yes, yes, yes.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.480
Of course we are friends.

00:27:19.799 --> 00:27:20.240
Then can I...

00:27:21.079 --> 00:27:22.400
ask for one more thing?

00:27:23.319 --> 00:27:23.920
Go ahead.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.920
Can we have just one day?

00:27:28.079 --> 00:27:29.440
Just the two of us.

00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:31.000
Go on a date.

00:27:33.119 --> 00:27:33.599
Just once.

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:35.319
Once is enough.

00:27:43.359 --> 00:27:43.759
Alright.

00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:49.799
Thank you.

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:50.759
Thank you, Gui Fang.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:51.319
You're welcome.

00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:51.839
Thank you so much.

00:27:52.359 --> 00:27:53.640
Uh, you're welcome, you're welcome.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.319
Thank you, Gui Fang.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.799
You're welcome, you're welcome.

00:27:56.759 --> 00:27:57.519
I'll go home now.

00:27:57.519 --> 00:27:58.279
Okay, okay, hurry back.

00:27:58.279 --> 00:27:59.079
You take out the trash first.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:27:59.920
I'll take out the trash.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:00.599
Thanks.

00:28:00.799 --> 00:28:01.599
No problem, no problem.

00:28:05.599 --> 00:28:06.240
This kid...

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:16.359
I'm leaving.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:17.720
Where are you going?

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:18.799
To watch a movie.

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.359
All dressed up with a hairpin, too?

00:28:25.519 --> 00:28:26.279
Going on a date?

00:28:26.759 --> 00:28:27.599
What date?

00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:28.880
I'm just watching a movie with a classmate.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.599
Mind your own business.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.440
You should worry about you and Xurui.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.200
She's such a good girl.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.039
Put some effort in, you know?

00:28:34.039 --> 00:28:34.839
Fine, don't worry about me.

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:35.480
Let's just stay out of each other's business.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.400
Go, go ahead, go, go.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.160
We'll talk when you get back.

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:37.440
Okay.

00:28:37.519 --> 00:28:37.960
I'm off.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:41.160
Here, here, here.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.599
This is cheap.

00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:44.640
Only 9.90 a bucket.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.240
Let's get two.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:46.440
There's a lot here.

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.440
This place is better.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.079
The cinema's large bucket is 45.

00:28:50.079 --> 00:28:50.960
Small bucket is 30.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.359
These two are only 20 bucks total.

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:53.079
Such a good deal.

00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:54.160
But on TV,

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.079
they always hold those buckets.

00:28:56.079 --> 00:28:57.079
TV is TV.

00:28:57.079 --> 00:28:58.039
Life is life.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.640
We're eating popcorn, not the bucket.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.119
You gotta save where you can.

00:29:02.119 --> 00:29:03.039
Can't spend it so fast.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.640
Wait for me a second.

00:29:17.039 --> 00:29:18.160
You know, right now,

00:29:18.359 --> 00:29:19.880
you're a star, after all.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.319
If you don't wear a hat,

00:29:21.319 --> 00:29:22.400
you'll stand out too much.

00:29:34.359 --> 00:29:35.640
This way, no one will notice me.

00:29:37.839 --> 00:29:38.759
Let's go, let's look around.

00:29:39.039 --> 00:29:39.440
Okay.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:43.000
There are free samples here.

00:29:43.839 --> 00:29:44.720
Smells so good.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.599
Hello, can we try some?

00:29:47.599 --> 00:29:48.480
Please serve us two bowls.

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.279
Sure.

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.279
Delicious.

00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.440
That yogurt just now was delicious.

00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:46.400
I'm full from drinking it.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.720
Yeah, I'm stuffed.

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.400
This...

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.680
This red-skinned potato...

00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.519
Isn't this a specialty from your hometown?

00:30:54.279 --> 00:30:54.960
Yes.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.000
The potatoes from back home are delicious.

00:30:57.279 --> 00:30:58.039
Just simply steamed...

00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:59.359
...they taste great without any seasoning.

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:01.000
I didn't expect your hometown's potatoes...

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.039
...to be sold here.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:04.000
Right now, the people who know about our potatoes...

00:31:04.119 --> 00:31:05.039
...are still too few.

00:31:05.559 --> 00:31:06.359
I hope one day...

00:31:06.599 --> 00:31:07.599
...when I have more influence...

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.960
...I can promote my hometown's potatoes everywhere.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.279
Are you Wei Mingtian?

00:31:12.839 --> 00:31:13.400
Yes, it's me.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:14.519
Buy some potatoes.

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:15.200
These potatoes are really good.

00:31:15.279 --> 00:31:16.039
Forget it, forget it.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.200
Guess I'm not influential enough yet.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:23.200
It's okay. I support you. I'll buy some.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:25.799
Come on.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:26.759
Help me pick some out.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.599
Okay.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:29.119
Put them in.

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.000
These aren't.

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:40.119
I didn't know the College of Agriculture had so many partner products.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.319
Yeah, I heard my teacher talk about it.

00:31:42.519 --> 00:31:44.599
Our College of Agriculture's partner products...

00:31:44.599 --> 00:31:46.119
...have to be sold on the market...

00:31:46.359 --> 00:31:47.279
...become products...

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:49.640
...become crops widely planted by everyone...

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:51.160
...served on everyone's tables...

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.279
...and enter everyone's lives.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.000
That's what gives agricultural science meaning.

00:31:55.599 --> 00:31:56.480
Suddenly I feel...

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.200
...scientists aren't that far away from us.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.440
So...

00:32:01.599 --> 00:32:03.160
...will you become a scientist like that in the future?

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.440
Me?

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.279
I've got a long way to go.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:09.000
No.

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.119
I have a feeling.

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:10.759
You can do it.

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:16.640
Work hard.

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:18.440
Okay.

00:32:24.039 --> 00:32:25.880
This product is from...

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:30.400
...1,492 oat resources...

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:31.599
I believe...

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:32.799
...you definitely can...

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.640
...promote your hometown's products everywhere.

00:32:41.759 --> 00:32:42.160
Hello.

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.200
Okay, first room on the left.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:44.640
Thanks.

00:32:51.599 --> 00:32:52.119
Right, here.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.160
Glad we made it in time.

00:33:06.599 --> 00:33:07.400
Thank you so much...

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.599
...for agreeing to watch this movie with me.

00:33:10.039 --> 00:33:10.640
After watching it...

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:12.279
I will sort out my feelings.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.440
I will tell myself...

00:33:14.119 --> 00:33:14.880
...we are just friends.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.759
The best comrades.

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:17.480
We'll be just like before.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:23.559
You practiced saying that a lot at home, didn't you?

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:24.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:26.119
Prepared all night.

00:33:52.799 --> 00:33:54.359
Apologies, everyone. So sorry.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.759
Due to equipment issues,

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:57.240
this screening has been canceled.

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.279
We can process refunds for everyone.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.599
Also, you can use your ticket stubs from this show

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.359
to go to the front desk

00:34:02.359 --> 00:34:04.119
and exchange them for any other show today.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.319
To make up for this unpleasant experience,

00:34:06.599 --> 00:34:08.760
the cinema has prepared popcorn and drinks for everyone.

00:34:09.039 --> 00:34:10.559
You can pick them up at the front desk shortly.

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.159
It's right here? Then I bought this for nothing.

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:14.119
Once again, we apologize.

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:15.000
Sorry about that.

00:34:15.639 --> 00:34:16.280
Please exit this way.

00:34:24.559 --> 00:34:25.079
Forget it.

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.360
Maybe the heavens

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.480
just didn't want us to see this movie.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.519
But isn't that up to us?

00:34:38.119 --> 00:34:39.159
Come on, let's go exchange the tickets.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:43.880
Okay, let's go.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:44.559
Let's go.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.519
Popular young star, cool idol Wei Mingtian,

00:34:51.519 --> 00:34:53.119
appeared at Wind Chime Paradise this weekend.

00:34:53.239 --> 00:34:55.119
A sweet secret date with a mysterious female classmate.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.239
The two even rode the Ferris wheel together

00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.719
and watched the confession fireworks.

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.920
Wei Mingtian shed his usual cool image,

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.880
casting loving gazes.

00:35:02.039 --> 00:35:03.440
According to insiders,

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.159
this student is Duxing University

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:06.840
College of Agriculture freshman, Kong X Fang.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.559
They attended the same cram school before university.

00:35:09.719 --> 00:35:11.480
Could it be that love grew over time?

00:35:11.639 --> 00:35:13.599
And Student Kong also

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:15.039
generously introduced Wei Mingtian to her friends.

I didn't mean to.

Financial freedom is not a dream.

00:36:00.079 --> 00:36:01.320
I've finally become a rich woman.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.719

Clicked it.
