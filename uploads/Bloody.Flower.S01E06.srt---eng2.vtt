WEBVTT

00:00:53.115 --> 00:00:54.115
How have you been?

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:58.155
Just a little bored.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:03.555
So everything's ready, right?

00:01:07.225 --> 00:01:10.135
Is the CCTV taken care of?

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:32.225
Make sure you memorize this.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.085
This is your route for that day.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:37.595
Are you sure about this?

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:40.995
Don't worry. I checked it myself.

00:01:41.295 --> 00:01:42.335
How long will it take?

00:01:44.595 --> 00:01:45.605
Three minutes.

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:49.705
Remember. If you're late by even a second,

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.675
your entire plan will go up in smoke.

00:01:53.275 --> 00:01:54.275
Don't worry.

00:02:03.015 --> 00:02:04.015
But...

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:06.885
Chairman Chae took your notebook.

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:09.425
That's fine.

00:02:10.655 --> 00:02:11.655
Anyway...

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:13.395
I've got it all up here.

00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:15.595
Besides, without me,

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:17.665
it's all useless.

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:20.605
I risked my life to get this far too.

00:02:22.405 --> 00:02:23.705
You'll keep your promise, right?

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:27.445
Professor.

00:02:28.645 --> 00:02:31.815
You think I want to keep drawing
my own blood forever?

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:36.885
I'll help you.

00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:39.585
With what you've dreamed of
your whole life...

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:41.785
developing the cure.

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:50.695
For now,
I need you to hide out at my place.

00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:53.935
Then come back here on Thursday at 2 p.m.

00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:15.225
You're here about
Professor Han's malpractice case, right?

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:20.695
It's official, so please ask me anything,
Prosecutor Cha.

00:03:23.365 --> 00:03:26.335
Since you're so gracious about a case
that's already closed,

00:03:26.735 --> 00:03:28.235
I'll be direct.

00:03:28.935 --> 00:03:31.735
The case was dismissed
for insufficient evidence,

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:35.145
but is it true that
Professor Han Sang Ho...

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:39.145
conducted human experiments
at the Chaeum Medical Research Center...

00:03:39.715 --> 00:03:40.715
without the patient's consent?

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:50.395
Yes, that is true.

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.425
However,
the part about not getting consent...

00:03:55.935 --> 00:03:57.095
That's a lie.

00:04:00.405 --> 00:04:04.535
The patient arrived in a coma
from a concussion when he exercised.

00:04:04.705 --> 00:04:06.605
We proceeded with the experiment
for treatment purposes...

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:11.215
only after getting consent
from his spouse.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:13.785
It's just that...

00:04:14.085 --> 00:04:17.115
the spouse kept demanding
financial compensation,

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:20.025
so we unfortunately had no choice
but to take the matter to court.

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:22.055
What about Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:27.625
You've done your homework on us.

00:04:30.195 --> 00:04:33.235
Please understand,
it's just part of the investigation.

00:04:33.435 --> 00:04:34.435
Of course.

00:04:35.335 --> 00:04:36.335
But...

00:04:38.135 --> 00:04:42.315
we treated Mr. Lee with consent
from his mother, his guardian.

00:04:50.455 --> 00:04:51.455
Prosecutor Cha.

00:04:53.985 --> 00:04:55.725
If it weren't for
Professor Han's research,

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:59.025
Lee Woo Gyeom might not be with us today.

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:03.265
The reason
we fully support Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:07.005
is because we've always been committed
to researching incurable diseases.

00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:11.905
My own father sadly passed away
from an incurable disease as well.

00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:17.645
But now,

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:22.045
my father's vision and work for Chaeum
have finally been realized...

00:05:23.655 --> 00:05:24.655
through Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:33.525
So that all patients with
incurable diseases...

00:05:33.995 --> 00:05:37.165
and their suffering families
can have a new lease on life,

00:05:38.095 --> 00:05:40.065
what's left is for Chaeum
and the government to cooperate...

00:05:40.535 --> 00:05:42.775
and do our absolute best, don't you think?

00:05:45.845 --> 00:05:48.045
For a world that's at least warmer...

00:05:48.905 --> 00:05:50.615
and healthier than the one we have today.

00:05:55.085 --> 00:05:59.285
(The Forbidden Truth)

00:05:59.925 --> 00:06:03.795
Lee Woo Gyeom,
who was a murder suspect only days ago,

00:06:03.895 --> 00:06:07.025
will finally treat his first patient today
at the shelter.

00:06:07.425 --> 00:06:10.295
The chosen patient
is the youngest victim...

00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:11.735
of the Seongji Industrial Complex
chemical spill,

00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:15.875
and is receiving massive public support.
Meanwhile,

00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:20.205
Lee Woo Gyeom's lawyer's child
was excluded, raising some eyebrows.

00:06:20.275 --> 00:06:23.315
What took you so long?
Come on, you have to see this.

00:06:24.545 --> 00:06:26.115
Just turn it off.

00:06:26.715 --> 00:06:28.415
That case is out of our hands now.

00:06:29.815 --> 00:06:32.985
No, it's not about the case.
It's amazing, isn't it?

00:06:33.425 --> 00:06:37.455
I never would have believed it,
but he can actually cure the incurable.

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:40.625
Because of that "amazing" ability,
our prosecutor got screwed over.

00:06:41.465 --> 00:06:42.935
Namhae, of all places. Unbelievable.

00:06:44.935 --> 00:06:45.935
Chief Bang.

00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:50.435
It seems Prosecutor Cha isn't giving up.
I was wondering if we...

00:06:50.505 --> 00:06:51.505
Don't even go there.

00:06:51.905 --> 00:06:54.175
Are you planning a fishing trip
to Geoje Island with Prosecutor Cha?

00:06:54.905 --> 00:06:56.345
What if Director Oh finds out?

00:06:57.475 --> 00:06:59.115
What's wrong with fishing?

00:06:59.715 --> 00:07:01.545
Just don't do anything, okay?

00:07:14.425 --> 00:07:15.425
Officer Lee.

00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:17.595
Officer Lee...

00:07:30.375 --> 00:07:34.445
They were a family of two.
But then his mother passed away,

00:07:34.515 --> 00:07:37.255
so he ended up in a vegetative state
with no next of kin.

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:41.725
We treated Mr. Lee with consent
from his mother, his guardian.

00:07:42.725 --> 00:07:45.055
But Lee Woo Gyeom's mother is dead.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:47.695
How did Chaeum get her consent?

00:07:57.205 --> 00:07:59.745
Hello, Detective Gong. Where are you now?

00:08:01.475 --> 00:08:02.475
Okay.

00:08:51.055 --> 00:08:54.895
I thought we agreed the treatment process
wouldn't be released to the public.

00:08:55.525 --> 00:08:59.035
We're filming briefly before the procedure
for promotional purposes.

00:09:19.925 --> 00:09:20.925
Are you scared?

00:09:26.265 --> 00:09:27.425
How about you close your eyes for me?

00:09:29.595 --> 00:09:30.935
Mommy.

00:09:31.335 --> 00:09:34.435
Ji Won. You need to do what he says.

00:09:41.145 --> 00:09:42.145
All right, open them.

00:09:44.615 --> 00:09:45.615
See? Easy, right?

00:09:46.645 --> 00:09:49.045
If you just close your eyes
and open them once,

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:51.115
it'll all be over.

00:09:56.755 --> 00:09:59.425
Okay, then. Ready to get started with me?

00:10:24.085 --> 00:10:28.055
I thought I made it clear
I wanted to be alone during the procedure.

00:10:28.885 --> 00:10:31.195
I'm sorry.
But you need to see this immediately.

00:10:37.895 --> 00:10:39.195
Professor Han had this.

00:10:39.735 --> 00:10:41.435
It's Lee Woo Gyeom's research notebook.

00:10:47.905 --> 00:10:48.905
Director Ahn.

00:10:49.475 --> 00:10:51.075
Get the research team together. Now.

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:54.545
This neighborhood is a little creepy.

00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:58.715
Exactly.
This is where you find the best scoops.

00:11:01.955 --> 00:11:02.995
It's over here.

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:04.995
This is...

00:11:06.625 --> 00:11:08.825
the place where
Lee Woo Gyeom's mother died.

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.435
So Lee Woo Gyeom must've lived
around here?

00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:14.605
Yeah, he did. Until he was convicted.

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:19.035
- Where was he arrested?
- Over there.

00:11:19.405 --> 00:11:20.845
About a ten-minute walk from here.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:27.985
- Reporter Jo.
- Yes.

00:11:28.085 --> 00:11:31.215
You said Lee Woo Gyeom's mother died from
a heart attack, right?

00:11:31.385 --> 00:11:34.325
Yes, a heart attack
from a myocardial infarction.

00:11:35.355 --> 00:11:37.825
Then why was her body found in a stream?

00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:43.065
Maybe she was in so much pain
that she fell in while trying to get help?

00:11:43.395 --> 00:11:45.665
No, I don't think so. Usually,

00:11:47.765 --> 00:11:49.605
you'd just collapse where you stand,

00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:51.435
or fall backwards.

00:11:51.975 --> 00:11:53.075
That's a good point.

00:12:02.015 --> 00:12:03.015
You feel it too, don't you?

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:05.515
Feel what?

00:12:05.985 --> 00:12:09.795
It's my reporter's instinct tingling.
I haven't felt this in a while.

00:12:11.425 --> 00:12:12.425
Let's go.

00:12:14.195 --> 00:12:16.565
Gosh. Hey, wait up!

00:12:27.145 --> 00:12:28.145
Prosecutor Cha.

00:12:28.845 --> 00:12:30.245
Do you really have to go this far?

00:12:30.815 --> 00:12:35.815
We found nothing at Lee Woo Gyeom's house.
You saw the scene photos.

00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:38.585
We have to do something.
We could've missed something.

00:12:39.285 --> 00:12:40.285
Get out of the way.

00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:52.135
Prosecutor Cha.

00:12:53.005 --> 00:12:56.305
The place has been like a haunted house
ever since Woo Gyeom's mother died.

00:13:00.445 --> 00:13:04.575
And we don't have a warrant.
You know the consequences for trespassing.

00:13:09.885 --> 00:13:11.115
Breaking and entering.

00:13:11.715 --> 00:13:12.825
And now we're accomplices.

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:39.685
- What are you doing?
- What?

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:40.985
Open it.

00:13:41.345 --> 00:13:43.585
Come on, Prosecutor Cha.
I'm not a burglar.

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:46.385
I'm a police officer for South Korea.

00:13:47.355 --> 00:13:50.325
And how am I supposed to open this anyway?

00:13:50.455 --> 00:13:52.425
Then call a locksmith.

00:13:54.565 --> 00:13:55.565
Hang on a second.

00:13:56.235 --> 00:13:57.235
Hey!

00:14:01.905 --> 00:14:02.905
Detective Gong.

00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:40.945
Gosh. How annoying.

00:14:52.255 --> 00:14:53.255
Oh man, I'm in big trouble.

00:14:55.625 --> 00:14:56.625
Are you okay?

00:15:00.325 --> 00:15:01.325
Wait.

00:15:01.925 --> 00:15:04.265
Prosecutor Cha? What are you doing here?

00:15:21.885 --> 00:15:24.085
Hold still. You'll make it worse.

00:15:25.885 --> 00:15:27.555
Gosh, you're making a fuss,
Prosecutor Cha.

00:15:31.195 --> 00:15:32.995
I'm so sorry, Prosecutor Cha.

00:15:33.295 --> 00:15:36.695
I guess my bones are just really dense.

00:15:37.265 --> 00:15:39.935
If that had been your head, you'd be
in serious trouble, Prosecutor Cha.

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:42.135
And what brings you here at this hour?

00:15:43.135 --> 00:15:45.605
"Turning Her Back on Desperate,
Terminally Ill Patients."

00:15:45.675 --> 00:15:48.475
That was from your article about
"The Heartless AI Prosecutor Cha Yi Yeon."

00:15:49.305 --> 00:15:50.315
That's what you wrote, Reporter Jo.

00:15:50.615 --> 00:15:51.775
It had a nice ring to it, don't you think?

00:15:52.615 --> 00:15:57.555
I took the liberty of using
your best photo from social media.

00:15:57.755 --> 00:16:00.725
- You liked it, I hope?
- Why don't you just answer my question?

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:04.125
What can I say, Prosecutor Cha?
Unfortunately, this isn't a courtroom.

00:16:04.325 --> 00:16:05.355
We're at a convenience store.

00:16:07.025 --> 00:16:10.465
Don't tell me you're curious
about my personal schedule.

00:16:11.965 --> 00:16:12.965
Yes.

00:16:13.365 --> 00:16:16.535
I'm dying to know,
so why don't you tell me?

00:16:16.805 --> 00:16:18.305
Gosh, you startled me.

00:16:19.205 --> 00:16:20.805
Somehow I doubt that.

00:16:21.875 --> 00:16:24.315
You can read all about it
when my article comes out.

00:16:25.815 --> 00:16:26.815
What article?

00:16:28.515 --> 00:16:29.515
It's just...

00:16:31.015 --> 00:16:34.155
It's just that I'm in the middle of

What exactly are you two plotting?

00:16:44.295 --> 00:16:46.365
- It's an exclusive. I can't tell you...
- If we tell you,

00:16:48.135 --> 00:16:49.335
can you help us?

Back when Lee Woo Gyeom was in a coma,

00:16:52.505 --> 00:16:54.175
did you know his mother reported him
as missing?

The deceased, Kim Hye Ju, following
her college student son's disappearance,

00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:25.375
personally visited his possible routes,
on-campus CCTVs, and nearby hospitals.

She continued the search effort
on her own.

This is corroborated
by witness statements.

It's been two weeks
since Woo Gyeom disappeared.

If you haven't found a single lead,

00:17:39.785 --> 00:17:42.325

a more aggressive investigation.

00:17:48.225 --> 00:17:52.095
During the search period, she experienced
sleep deprivation, refused to eat,

00:17:52.435 --> 00:17:54.865
and had recurring bouts of
severe depression.

00:17:55.435 --> 00:17:58.135
She was observed raising her voice
at acquaintances and strangers...

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.545
and exhibiting hostile reactions,

00:18:01.005 --> 00:18:03.075

her mental and physical state...

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:05.415

I apologize.

I thought I made it clear...

00:20:50.045 --> 00:20:53.215
I'd give you whatever support you need.

00:20:59.185 --> 00:21:00.385

was declared fully recovered.

She has.

00:22:29.575 --> 00:22:31.445
Then she must have lost her vision, too.

00:22:36.215 --> 00:22:38.055
That means her memory loss...

00:22:39.215 --> 00:22:41.025
will start to accelerate.

00:24:42.575 --> 00:24:43.745
Yes, Attorney Park.

00:24:44.775 --> 00:24:47.945
It's about the license plate
you asked me to look into earlier.

00:24:48.745 --> 00:24:49.845
It turns out...

00:24:50.255 --> 00:24:53.785
- it's a Chaeum company car.
- Chaeum?

00:24:53.985 --> 00:24:58.355
Yes. And just as you suspected,
it seems Chaeum...

00:24:59.395 --> 00:25:01.365
was spying on Professor Han.

00:25:02.065 --> 00:25:03.065
Is that right?

00:25:03.325 --> 00:25:07.335
I was looking into Lee Woo Gyeom's mother
for a feature article yesterday,

00:25:07.835 --> 00:25:09.505
I happened to run into Prosecutor Cha.

00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:11.275
(Chaeum Medical Research Institute)

00:25:12.435 --> 00:25:13.435
Where?

00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.375
Near Lee Woo Gyeom's house.

00:25:16.405 --> 00:25:17.945
Okay, got it. I'll be in touch.

00:25:38.135 --> 00:25:40.265
Chaeum was keeping tabs on Professor Han?

00:25:41.565 --> 00:25:45.035
You were right.
In Professor Han's malpractice case,

00:25:45.605 --> 00:25:47.475
Director Oh, Chairman Chae,

00:25:48.105 --> 00:25:50.075
and Lee Woo Gyeom all seem to be involved.

00:25:50.645 --> 00:25:52.745
Actually, I met with
Chairman Chae this morning.

00:25:53.615 --> 00:25:54.945
What's strange is,

00:25:55.245 --> 00:25:59.055
Chairman Chae said that Professor Han...

00:25:59.115 --> 00:26:00.985
was close to his father,
the founder and first chairman of Chaeum,

00:26:01.785 --> 00:26:04.555
and made it sound like he was instrumental
in developing the treatment.

00:26:05.095 --> 00:26:06.095
But then...

00:26:06.455 --> 00:26:08.195
why would they have been keeping tabs
on Professor Han?

00:26:09.565 --> 00:26:12.865
Then it seems the reason
Professor Han disappeared...

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:16.465
was probably to stay off
Chairman Chae's radar...

00:26:17.735 --> 00:26:18.935
Why did you...

00:26:20.575 --> 00:26:21.605
go to Lee Woo Gyeom's house?

00:26:25.475 --> 00:26:27.815
I wanted to start over from the beginning.

00:26:28.915 --> 00:26:32.755
It's true I lost the trial
because I doubted his healing skills,

00:26:33.685 --> 00:26:35.885
but I don't think the reason Director Oh
is trying to send me to Namhae...

00:26:36.585 --> 00:26:38.355
is just because of the trial.

00:26:42.125 --> 00:26:43.295
I still... No,

00:26:43.895 --> 00:26:45.195
even if it kills me,

00:26:45.595 --> 00:26:47.705
I will never accept that
Lee Woo Gyeom is a murderer.

00:26:51.105 --> 00:26:52.105
Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:26:52.905 --> 00:26:55.405
Why do you hate him so much?

00:26:55.475 --> 00:26:58.345
He killed 17 people.

00:26:59.445 --> 00:27:01.245
Even before we arrived at the scene
to arrest him,

00:27:01.315 --> 00:27:03.185
that bastard knew I was coming.

00:27:03.585 --> 00:27:06.685
- What?
- Even while you were his lawyer,

00:27:06.985 --> 00:27:09.585
he tried to make a deal with me
to stage a medical demonstration.

00:27:10.085 --> 00:27:11.755
I'd like to make a different deal.

00:27:12.095 --> 00:27:16.125
First, Prosecutor Cha,
you need to help me find a way...

00:27:16.465 --> 00:27:17.495
to demonstrate my abilities in court.

00:27:20.095 --> 00:27:21.235
The nerve of him.

00:27:22.335 --> 00:27:24.035
A man who should be facing justice...

00:27:24.305 --> 00:27:27.645
is instead trying to use the law
to achieve his own ends.

00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:31.015
If I can just figure out
Lee Woo Gyeom's motive,

00:27:31.745 --> 00:27:35.145
I'm sure I can get the verdict overturned,
even now.

00:27:38.255 --> 00:27:40.015
But Director Oh is involved.

00:27:40.685 --> 00:27:43.255
You'd have to be prepared
to risk your entire career for this.

00:27:44.225 --> 00:27:45.255
Are you okay with that?

00:27:47.725 --> 00:27:48.725
If it all goes south,

00:27:49.225 --> 00:27:51.835
I guess I'll just become
a human rights attorney like you.

00:27:53.705 --> 00:27:56.465
You sure like to make things complicated
for yourself.

00:27:57.805 --> 00:27:59.135
Look who's talking.

00:28:00.705 --> 00:28:03.575
All the investigation materials
I have so far on Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:28:03.645 --> 00:28:06.115
I'll have Reporter Jo send them to you.

00:28:06.645 --> 00:28:07.645
You will?

00:28:07.945 --> 00:28:08.945
I'll help you.

00:28:09.915 --> 00:28:10.915
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:28:11.255 --> 00:28:13.725
Or, instead of only receiving,

00:28:14.285 --> 00:28:15.525
you'd like to give me something in return.

00:28:16.485 --> 00:28:17.925
What's that supposed to mean?

00:28:18.925 --> 00:28:22.295
I'll help find Lee Woo Gyeom's motive.
In return,

00:28:24.295 --> 00:28:26.565
you give me access
to the prosecution's database...

00:28:27.165 --> 00:28:30.335
and hand over every bit of information
you have on Chairman Chae.

00:28:33.675 --> 00:28:37.075
Don't I get the short end of the stick?

00:28:37.615 --> 00:28:39.145
How exactly are you planning to help me?

00:28:40.245 --> 00:28:42.745
Do you have some information...

00:28:43.145 --> 00:28:47.155
- on Lee Woo Gyeom that I don't know?
- Everything I couldn't reveal in court...

00:28:47.985 --> 00:28:48.985
all of Lee Woo Gyeom's...

00:28:50.285 --> 00:28:51.655
right down to his personal life...

00:28:52.525 --> 00:28:53.965
I'll hand it all over to you.

00:28:56.825 --> 00:28:58.165
And it's actually useful, right?

00:28:59.035 --> 00:29:00.465
Well, that's for you to decide.

00:29:03.665 --> 00:29:04.775
Take a look and get back to me.

00:29:11.845 --> 00:29:12.845
Yi Yeon.

00:29:15.885 --> 00:29:17.985
You need to lay off the drinking
during work hours.

00:29:21.055 --> 00:29:23.795
If you're stressed, think things through
or blow off some steam.

00:29:24.595 --> 00:29:25.925
Don't just rely on alcohol.

00:29:26.825 --> 00:29:28.865
To each their own, right?

00:29:29.225 --> 00:29:30.495
You'll kill yourself that way, kid.

00:29:32.735 --> 00:29:34.705
I'm just wondering. If you die drunk...

00:29:36.035 --> 00:29:37.065
wouldn't that just be pathetic?

00:29:39.535 --> 00:29:41.105
Don't make your life so complicated.

00:29:43.375 --> 00:29:44.615
Take care of yourself.

00:29:46.475 --> 00:29:47.485
I'm off.

00:30:04.535 --> 00:30:07.465
Ma'am, two more orders of pork jowl,
please.

00:30:07.835 --> 00:30:10.635
Prosecutor Cha, please stop ordering.
I'm going to get fat.

00:30:11.775 --> 00:30:14.805
What are you talking about?
You've gotten so thin.

00:30:16.105 --> 00:30:20.215
You stayed up late helping me last time,
so you should eat up.

00:30:21.285 --> 00:30:23.545
Prosecutor Cha, what are you
roping me into this time?

00:30:24.015 --> 00:30:26.355
I told you, this isn't about work.

00:30:26.855 --> 00:30:29.285
I've wanted to treat you
to a nice meal for a while.

00:30:29.725 --> 00:30:32.025
And even before the Lee Woo Gyeom case,

00:30:32.095 --> 00:30:34.725
you were the only one who ever helped me.

00:30:35.125 --> 00:30:36.765
You don't actually think
I'd forget that, do you?

00:30:38.665 --> 00:30:40.495
- But, Detective Gong...
- Oh, come on.

00:30:41.165 --> 00:30:43.065
Don't worry, I won't eat another bite.

00:30:44.205 --> 00:30:45.305
No, that's not it.

00:30:45.735 --> 00:30:47.205
There's just something
I wanted to ask you.

00:30:48.645 --> 00:30:53.145
Before I was transferred here,
which prosecutor did you work with?

00:30:55.745 --> 00:30:56.915
Let's see...

00:30:57.455 --> 00:30:59.215
His last name was Oh.

00:31:00.555 --> 00:31:03.385
That's right. Prosecutor Oh Hyeon Deuk.

00:31:06.255 --> 00:31:08.025
He's my boss now.

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.635
- What a coincidence.
- Is he doing well?

00:31:10.995 --> 00:31:15.905
We're in the same jurisdiction.
We all run in the same circles, right?

00:31:18.505 --> 00:31:22.775
Sorry, that was a random question. Eat up.

00:31:26.645 --> 00:31:28.785
We should all get together
with your team soon.

00:31:29.045 --> 00:31:32.055
I'll set up one last dinner
before I leave for Namhae.

00:31:32.115 --> 00:31:35.085
No need. It's not like you're leaving
under good circumstances.

00:31:35.485 --> 00:31:38.025
I'm sure if I go down,
I'll come back up someday.

00:31:38.855 --> 00:31:41.525
- Get home safe.
- All right, I'll head out then.

I insist on
a more aggressive investigation.

00:32:08.755 --> 00:32:10.255
There's a procedure
for these things, ma'am.

00:32:11.055 --> 00:32:13.095
Everything is proceeding
according to protocol,

00:32:13.355 --> 00:32:14.625
so you'll just have to wait.

00:32:34.915 --> 00:32:37.815
Hello? No, it's nothing in particular.

00:32:38.115 --> 00:32:39.455
Let's just grab dinner later.

00:32:40.485 --> 00:32:41.485
Yes.

00:32:42.685 --> 00:32:44.355
I know this is a little awkward.

00:32:48.265 --> 00:32:51.235
I just felt I had to say a proper goodbye
before leaving.

00:32:52.265 --> 00:32:53.935
I really appreciate all of your hard work.

00:33:04.245 --> 00:33:05.245
Let me pour it for you.

00:33:10.615 --> 00:33:11.615
Cheers.

00:33:19.925 --> 00:33:21.565
How's your new post?

00:33:21.865 --> 00:33:24.695
It's beyond uneventful.
It's just plain boring.

00:33:26.335 --> 00:33:28.765
I'm telling you, it's so bad I'm starting
to miss Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:33:32.675 --> 00:33:33.675
Sorry about that.

00:33:36.605 --> 00:33:37.745
What about you, Officer Lee?

00:33:48.655 --> 00:33:50.755
How far along are you, Prosecutor Cha?

00:33:51.355 --> 00:33:54.225
- What?
- If you've seen the report,

00:33:54.725 --> 00:33:56.425
Professor Han, Chaeum Medical Center,

00:33:56.925 --> 00:33:59.395
Director Oh, and Assemblyman Baek,
the head prosecutor back then.

00:34:00.395 --> 00:34:03.735
You must've realized they're all connected
to Lee Woo Gyeom, right?

00:34:05.105 --> 00:34:08.475
So why haven't you asked us for help?

00:34:09.745 --> 00:34:12.045
- The meat is going to burn.
- Just...

00:34:12.445 --> 00:34:13.715
Just stay out of this for a minute.

00:34:19.285 --> 00:34:21.055
We've worked together
for about two years now.

00:34:22.385 --> 00:34:23.485
We should have...

00:34:24.525 --> 00:34:26.395
grabbed a drink like this sooner.

00:34:28.425 --> 00:34:30.395
I've been so stubborn this whole time.

00:34:31.035 --> 00:34:32.295
You all must have been
so frustrated with me.

00:34:48.045 --> 00:34:49.885
Yes, we're frustrated.

00:34:52.085 --> 00:34:53.915
Because we're on your side.

00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:58.025
So let's solve
the Lee Woo Gyeom case together.

00:35:02.365 --> 00:35:04.835
This case is too big for you
to handle alone, you know?

00:35:05.235 --> 00:35:08.665
Why do you try to shoulder the burden
and solve everything on your own?

00:35:08.865 --> 00:35:10.135
We're right here with you.

00:35:24.715 --> 00:35:28.355
If Director Oh finds out,
you'll be forced to resign before I am.

00:35:28.955 --> 00:35:30.025
Are you okay with that?

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:33.155
If it means having to do something
I don't believe in,

00:35:33.625 --> 00:35:34.625
I'd rather...

00:35:35.095 --> 00:35:37.765
stay home in my pajamas
and binge-watch all the shows I've missed.

00:35:40.965 --> 00:35:41.965
Let's have a drink.

00:35:46.775 --> 00:35:49.075
To get through what's coming,

00:35:49.975 --> 00:35:51.915
we can't do it sober.

- Cheers.

doing here?

00:36:27.175 --> 00:36:28.415
Like you said,

00:36:28.415 --> 00:36:31.885
I gave the files of Lee Woo Gyeom
to Prosecutor Cha this morning,

00:36:32.215 --> 00:36:34.785
and she gave me the case file
on Kim Hye Ju's death.

00:36:35.855 --> 00:36:37.895
- And?
- The person-in-change of the autopsy...

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:39.495
and the one who closed the case...

00:36:40.395 --> 00:36:41.725
was Detective Gong.

00:36:42.225 --> 00:36:43.225
Really?

00:36:43.765 --> 00:36:45.895
When we visited the scene,

00:36:46.035 --> 00:36:50.865
Something about her death seemed off,
so we asked Prosecutor Cha about it.

Before the police and prosecution
split investigations,

00:36:53.375 --> 00:36:56.505
the person who worked with Detective Gong
was the one Prosecutor Cha reports to.

00:36:56.775 --> 00:36:58.875
It was Chief Prosecutor Oh Hyeon Deuk,

00:36:58.875 --> 00:37:00.985
who handled
Professor Han's malpractice case.

00:37:01.685 --> 00:37:02.685
What?

00:37:05.915 --> 00:37:06.985
Oh Hyeon Deuk?

00:37:12.155 --> 00:37:13.155
First,

00:37:13.755 --> 00:37:17.025
I'll meet Lee Woo Gyeom myself to find out
about his mother, Kim Hye Ju's death...

00:37:17.395 --> 00:37:19.765
and about Professor Han.

00:37:20.265 --> 00:37:23.335
During the period of
Professor Han's malpractice case...

00:37:23.965 --> 00:37:26.175
Reporter Jo, you dig into what the people
at Chaeum were up to back then.

00:37:26.505 --> 00:37:29.375
Min Gyeong,
you dig into Assemblyman Baek's people.

00:37:29.545 --> 00:37:33.915
Okay. But does this mean
we're working with Prosecutor Cha now?

00:37:33.975 --> 00:37:35.085
Yes, that's right.

00:37:36.485 --> 00:37:39.485
Help Prosecutor Cha
with whatever she needs.

00:37:40.315 --> 00:37:42.385
Getting to use data
from the prosecution...

00:37:43.685 --> 00:37:45.225
is a huge advantage for us too.

00:37:46.925 --> 00:37:48.865
- That's true.
- Right.

00:38:03.405 --> 00:38:06.645
- Is it good?
- I don't eat for taste. It's just fuel.

00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:13.215
Anyway, when are we pulling the trigger?

00:38:14.185 --> 00:38:16.485
It's hot out. No need to drag our feet.

00:38:18.695 --> 00:38:21.395
Make sure you keep your people in line,
all right?

00:38:21.765 --> 00:38:24.125
It'll be a headache
if Prosecutor Cha gets ahold of them.

00:38:25.895 --> 00:38:26.995
Don't you worry about that.

00:38:34.005 --> 00:38:35.545
How can you expect me not to worry?

00:38:35.875 --> 00:38:37.505
Prosecutor Cha knows
what they all look like.

00:38:37.815 --> 00:38:40.545
Do you know what I went through
to find that one CCTV clip?

00:38:41.215 --> 00:38:43.345
That woman is something else.

00:38:44.185 --> 00:38:46.985
If Lee Woo Gyeom is the serial killer
of the century,

00:38:47.185 --> 00:38:51.325
then Prosecutor Cha is the craziest psycho
of them all.

00:38:52.925 --> 00:38:54.795
At this rate,
it's only a matter of time...

00:38:56.125 --> 00:38:57.525
before she gets a lead on Chairman Chae.

00:38:58.635 --> 00:39:01.665
Spare me your useless advice.

00:39:02.665 --> 00:39:04.635
And just eat up, Detective Gong.

00:39:07.775 --> 00:39:08.975
Eat up.

00:39:11.175 --> 00:39:13.745
After all, you need to outlive
Prosecutor Cha, don't you?

00:39:17.585 --> 00:39:18.585
Go on.

00:39:19.355 --> 00:39:20.355
Right.

00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:24.755
You pour a lot.

00:39:30.695 --> 00:39:32.595
But don't you think
Attorney Park is being a little strange?

00:39:32.965 --> 00:39:33.965
How so?

00:39:34.165 --> 00:39:37.535
He already won the case.
Why is he helping Prosecutor Cha?

00:39:38.405 --> 00:39:40.875
Maybe he feels a responsibility
to see it through to the end.

00:39:41.675 --> 00:39:42.945
Responsible for what?

00:39:43.375 --> 00:39:44.745
Not the trial.

00:39:45.075 --> 00:39:49.145
On a human level,
Prosecutor Cha was his junior,

00:39:49.215 --> 00:39:50.915
And Lee Woo Gyeom was his client.

00:39:51.915 --> 00:39:54.115
I'm not buying that for a second.

00:39:54.585 --> 00:39:56.285
If you're not buying it,

00:39:56.555 --> 00:39:58.155
Then hurry and find the files
on Assemblyman Baek.

00:39:58.225 --> 00:40:00.025
Something's really off.

00:40:01.895 --> 00:40:04.495
He must be so preoccupied
with Min Seo, too.

00:40:08.705 --> 00:40:11.335
Out of 100ml of Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom's blood,

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:14.445
they say only one percent can be used
as a therapeutic component.

00:40:15.005 --> 00:40:18.775
And that's reportedly only enough
to treat one patient.

00:40:19.245 --> 00:40:21.045
Yes, I've heard that as well.

00:40:21.115 --> 00:40:24.415
And surely, he can't have 100ml of blood
drawn every single day.

00:40:24.555 --> 00:40:26.815
That's correct.
So here are the terms of the treatment.

00:40:26.955 --> 00:40:28.685
That his blood is drawn
once every three days,

00:40:29.355 --> 00:40:31.925
and that it can only treat one patient.

00:40:32.425 --> 00:40:36.895
I see. As for the Chaeum Medical Center,
where he's staying,

00:40:36.895 --> 00:40:37.965
What can you tell us about it?

00:40:38.735 --> 00:40:40.335
You've probably heard the name before.

00:40:40.795 --> 00:40:43.665
Professor Chae Jeong Hoon,
the leading authority on stem cells.

00:40:43.965 --> 00:40:48.275
It began as a hospital
that he founded back in 1990.

00:40:48.705 --> 00:40:53.415
It has since expanded to add
a pharmaceutical research institute,

00:40:53.575 --> 00:40:55.415
making it the largest medical group
in the country.

00:40:55.715 --> 00:41:00.555
It's currently headed by his son,
Chairman Chae Jeong Su.

00:41:00.755 --> 00:41:03.155
In fact, their stock price is going
through the roof right now.

00:41:03.885 --> 00:41:05.955
The stock price? What do you mean by that?

00:41:06.825 --> 00:41:10.665
From the moment the first patient
was declared fully cured until now,

00:41:11.125 --> 00:41:13.395
the stock has been hitting
the price ceiling every single day.

00:41:25.945 --> 00:41:28.515
(Chaeum Medical Center)

00:42:19.535 --> 00:42:20.765
And what does that tell you?

00:42:21.265 --> 00:42:24.505
It means the public has enormous faith...

00:42:24.775 --> 00:42:27.135
that a cure for this incurable disease
will be developed...

00:42:27.335 --> 00:42:30.375
by Chaeum Medical Center,
which is supporting Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:42:31.715 --> 00:42:32.715
Yes, what is it?

00:42:34.115 --> 00:42:37.015
To examine the newly selected patient,
we need a piece of equipment...

00:42:37.085 --> 00:42:39.155
from Hana Hospital.
It's the only one in the country.

00:42:40.185 --> 00:42:41.385
What's the patient's condition?

00:42:42.025 --> 00:42:44.485
The patient has both Crohn's disease
and hemophilia.

00:42:44.995 --> 00:42:47.695
Even Lee Woo Gyeom has never seen
such a case, so a full exam is needed.

00:42:53.895 --> 00:42:54.905
Okay, I approved.

00:42:55.435 --> 00:42:57.765
Yes, sir.
I'll increase the security detail...

00:42:57.835 --> 00:43:00.735
- and ask for government support.
- Yes, understood.

00:43:41.815 --> 00:43:42.985
I'm in front Hana Hospital,

00:43:42.985 --> 00:43:46.915
where Lee Woo Gyeom will perform
his first-ever outpatient procedure...

00:43:46.915 --> 00:43:48.055
for his third treatment.

00:43:48.555 --> 00:43:53.525
The patient, Jeon Seung Hoon, suffers from
both Crohn's disease and hemophilia,

00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:56.165
making for an extremely rare medical case.

00:43:56.525 --> 00:43:59.835
As you might expect,
the front of the hospital is now...

00:43:59.895 --> 00:44:01.965
and has become an absolute media circus.

00:44:02.565 --> 00:44:05.205
Gathering nearby
are many of his followers,

00:44:05.275 --> 00:44:09.475
praying for
the patient's successful treatment.

00:44:09.975 --> 00:44:13.415
In this situation, the question is
if Lee Woo Gyeom can work another miracle,

00:44:13.475 --> 00:44:15.385
and all eyes are on the outcome.

00:44:19.555 --> 00:44:22.085
- It's Lee Woo Gyeom! There he is!
- He's here!

00:44:23.325 --> 00:44:25.255
(Ministry of Justice)

00:44:26.125 --> 00:44:28.495
- It's Lee Woo Gyeom.
- Mr. Lee, a comment, please!

00:44:28.565 --> 00:44:30.295
Can you cure this patient as well?

00:44:32.095 --> 00:44:33.565
(Medical Demonstration Area)

00:44:33.635 --> 00:44:35.565
Are you confident today's procedure
will be a success?

00:44:36.065 --> 00:44:38.405
- Please give us a statement!
- Are you confident in the demonstration?

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.605
- Just one comment, please!
- Over here, please!

00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:43.575
- Just one comment, please!
- A word, please!

00:44:51.555 --> 00:44:53.155
I'm almost there.

00:44:55.125 --> 00:44:57.125
(Hana Hospital)

00:44:58.325 --> 00:45:00.625
(Restricted Area: Authorized Personnel)

00:45:22.845 --> 00:45:25.385
Detective Gong. What happened?

00:45:25.815 --> 00:45:28.455
Looks like the incident happened
the day we got here.

00:45:33.295 --> 00:45:35.425
They're saying he's been dead
for about two days,

00:45:36.595 --> 00:45:38.765
and the person we saw in front of
Lee Woo Gyeom's house...

00:45:40.465 --> 00:45:42.105
I think it was Professor Han.

00:45:50.705 --> 00:45:53.515
- What is it?
- Prosecutor Cha, Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:45:53.775 --> 00:45:56.245
In the midst of the medical demonstration,
Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:46:15.935 --> 00:46:17.805
