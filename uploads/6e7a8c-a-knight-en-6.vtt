WEBVTT

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:26.151
Mm?

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.868
Been a wonderful tournament.

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:39.873
Shame it's all over.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:44.836
Home is...

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:50.717
Ah, it's brutally dull.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:54.596
Hey.

00:00:56.265 --> 00:00:57.683
You could come with me.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.728
Yeah, we'll hunt and hawk and...

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:04.189
Sail, make merry.

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.024
I'll sharpen that iron of yours
so you don't make

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.277
such a grand fool of yourself next time.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.362
Have you ever been to Tarth?

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.948
- The man is dying, my lord.
- Huh? What?

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:17.202
His wounds, they have mortified.
It's beyond my abilities.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:18.745
Oh, the Others fucking geld me.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:22.874
Beyond your-- an itchy arsehole
is beyond your abilities, my friend.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:24.292
Begone, witch!

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:26.961
- Fuck off with you.
- Yes, my lord. At once.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.007
Cunt. It's fine. You're fine.
He's a terrible maester.

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:33.135
Look.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:40.475
Come with me to Storm's End,
and I will love you like a brother.

00:01:46.898 --> 00:01:48.317
Oh, cunt.

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:52.696
And if not...

00:01:53.739 --> 00:01:56.950
Well, fuck you,
I'll hate you like a brother.

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.791
It's a fine offer, Lyonel.

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:10.797
But all I do is bring pain and suffering
to those around me.

00:02:10.881 --> 00:02:13.341
You've done the realm a kindness.
You'll see that one day.

00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:15.510
The only good dragon is a dead dragon.

00:02:15.594 --> 00:02:16.887
Fucking gods!

00:02:18.347 --> 00:02:19.556
Baelor fought for me.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.808
He gave his fucking life.

00:02:21.892 --> 00:02:23.893
Can you speak of him
with a little respect, please?

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:25.479
Fuck that, and fuck you!

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.565
I fought for you.

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:30.149
Hardyng, Beesbury,

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.819
the fucking apple boy, we fought for you.

00:02:32.903 --> 00:02:36.614
Your prince fought for you
against men sworn to protect him.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.575
He risked nothing!

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.122
And the gods don't favor a fraud.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.254
Then why have they favored me?

00:02:52.964 --> 00:02:54.716
This is not favor, this...

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:58.178
This is mockery.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.473
There's a war coming.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.267
We could be a force, you and I.

00:03:06.395 --> 00:03:07.896
You'll consider it?

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.777
Good! Caravan departs after the roast.

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:18.198
Baelor of House Targaryen.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:21.284
Prince of Dragonstone.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.788
Heir apparent to the Iron Throne.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.542
Hand of King Daeron the Good.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:31.586
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

00:03:32.713 --> 00:03:35.340
and Protector of the Realm.

00:03:38.552 --> 00:03:39.886
May the gods keep him.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.496
My prince.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:10.500
Your father, he was...

00:04:12.586 --> 00:04:14.003
He was a great man.

00:04:14.087 --> 00:04:15.672
He died in my armor.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.387
Plenty of sons have died
in their father's armor.

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:28.435
How many fathers have died in their son's?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.983
I could not say.

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:44.326
He was still young.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:49.122
He had it in him to be a great king.

00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:51.750
The greatest since Aegon the Dragon.

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:59.633
Why would the gods take him and leave you?

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:06.515
I've wondered the same.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.315
Be gone with you, Ser Duncan.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:30.914
Ser Duncan. Dunk!

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.670
I went by your camp, but you weren't there.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:39.256
I started getting worried.

00:05:41.049 --> 00:05:42.634
You've come from Baelor's funeral?

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:45.887
I can't believe you went.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.223
I thought I owed it to him.

00:05:53.895 --> 00:05:55.313
Everybody...

00:05:55.397 --> 00:05:58.108
Everybody blames me for his death,
don't they?

00:06:01.862 --> 00:06:03.113
I don't.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:22.632
Okay.

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:31.432
Steffon took my tent.

00:06:31.516 --> 00:06:33.894
Said I betrayed the family by abandoning him.

00:06:35.145 --> 00:06:36.521
Can you believe that?

00:06:37.772 --> 00:06:39.065
Left with little else.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.733
I'm sorry, Raymun.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.153
No, don't be. He's just mad that he lost.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.404
First trial of seven in 100 years,

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.366
and Lord Steffon Fossoway
got beat by his little cousin.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.745
Besides, it's better to be
an unripe green apple

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:54.414
than a wormy red one.

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.629
Suits you.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:03.548
I think I broke one of my cousin's ribs.

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.134
Morning.

00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.307
Good morning.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:15.769
Ser Duncan, this is Rowan...

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.484
Of the Green Apple Fossoways.

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.654
- Huh?
- My wife.

00:07:26.738 --> 00:07:28.907
Pleased to meet you, Ser Duncan.

00:07:30.325 --> 00:07:31.743
Oh! Right.

00:07:32.369 --> 00:07:34.704
Pleased to meet you too, Lady Rowan.

00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:36.247
She come and watched the trial.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.541
- Said I fought like a wild bull.
- Mm.

00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.794
And with all the grace of one.

00:07:48.343 --> 00:07:49.427
Ah.

00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.138
I had no squire to see to my wounds,

00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:54.474
and she offered to help me out my armor and...

00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:01.939
Anyway, she said
I've got her with child now,

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.150
so I figured we ought to get married.

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:08.655
Feels like a boy.

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:11.574
You hear that, Ser Duncan? A boy.

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:16.204
That's...

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.041
Ser Duncan.

00:08:21.042 --> 00:08:22.544
Prince Maekar demands a word.

00:08:23.545 --> 00:08:25.588
- You're to come with us.
- He's not going anywhere.

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:27.799
- He's been through enough.
- It's fine.

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:35.724
I'll be fine.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.476
Congratulations.

00:09:08.757 --> 00:09:10.967
I'm sending Aerion to the East.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:18.058
A few years in the Free Cities
may change him for the better.

00:09:26.357 --> 00:09:29.027
Some men will say
I meant to kill my brother.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:34.782
The gods know it is a lie,
but I will hear the whispers

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:36.618
till the day I die.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.997
You swung the mace, m'lord.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.336
But it was for me Prince Baelor died.

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.422
You will hear them whisper as well.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.509
The king is old.

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:58.723
When he dies, each time
a battle is lost or a crop fails,

00:09:58.807 --> 00:10:01.434
the fools will say Baelor
would not have let it happen.

00:10:04.979 --> 00:10:06.940
But the hedge knight killed him.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:11.820
If I had not fought,

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:16.116
you would have had my hand and foot.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.996
I sat under the tree this morning

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.416
and I asked, could I have spared one?

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:35.635
I mean, how can a foot
be worth a prince's life?

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.556
And what answer does your tree give you?

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.150
Every day at evenfall,

00:10:51.317 --> 00:10:54.821
Ser Arlan would say,
"I wonder what the morrow will bring."

00:10:57.824 --> 00:11:00.868
Mightn't it be that some morrow will come
when I'll have need of that foot,

00:11:00.952 --> 00:11:05.456
when the realm will need that foot
even more than a prince's life?

00:11:08.585 --> 00:11:10.170
Not bloody likely.

00:11:11.254 --> 00:11:14.007
The realm has as many
hedge knights as hedges.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:26.102
My youngest son seems
to have grown fond of you, ser.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.189
It is time he was a squire.

00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:34.027
But he tells me he will serve
no knight but you.

00:11:36.237 --> 00:11:39.406
He is an unruly boy,
as you will have noticed.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.866
He's a good lad.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.286
Just needs a stern hand, that's all.

00:11:46.247 --> 00:11:47.457
Will you have him?

00:11:50.919 --> 00:11:52.169
Me?

00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:54.422
There is a place for you at Summerhall.

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:59.677
You'll swear your sword to me,
and Aegon can squire for you.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:02.012
While you train him,

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.641
my master-at-arms
will finish your own training.

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:10.730
Your Ser Arlan did all he could for you,
I have no doubt.

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:14.901
But you still have much to learn.

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.662
I beg your pardon, m'lord, I do.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:31.751
But I think I'm done with princes.

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:36.506
Yeah.

00:12:57.485 --> 00:12:58.861
Were you spying?

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:03.866
No.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.211
Are you in a lot of pain?

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.139
- Ser?
- I can't, Egg.

00:13:28.308 --> 00:13:29.309
I'm sorry.

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.319
Maybe you're not the knight
I thought you were.

00:14:00.631 --> 00:14:02.717
Have you heard this story before?

00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:06.095
Many times.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:07.972
From where?

00:14:10.391 --> 00:14:11.476
From you.

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.311
Oh.

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:24.571
- May I ask you, ser--
- When a lord calls his banners

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:27.616
and sends us boys off to war,

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.411
it's custom for each to nail a penny

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.164
to the oak in the square.

00:14:34.165 --> 00:14:37.001
And if we return, to take it down.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.338
Oh, it's a great oak tree.

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:43.424
And yet,

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:48.179
it's often hard to find
a spare bit to nail a new penny.

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.770
Why did you never knight me?

00:14:58.231 --> 00:14:59.857
Did you think I'd leave you?

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:03.653
I wouldn't have.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:10.076
Or was it something else?

00:15:16.082 --> 00:15:17.083
Ser?

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:23.297
Ser?

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:30.972
Ser?

00:15:55.288 --> 00:15:58.916
And that's why they call it the Pennytree.

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:06.299
A true knight always finishes a story.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:11.971
- To Beesbury.
- And to Hardyng.

00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:14.932
- To their memory.
- To the brave hearts.

00:16:16.017 --> 00:16:17.768
How do they get the bees to swarm like that?

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.315
Some sort of magic?

00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.400
Magic?

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:26.610
What?

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:28.446
Well, they put the queen
in Beesbury's coffin.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:32.282
Oh!

00:16:32.366 --> 00:16:35.452
Fucking bee magic.
My poor sweet warrior.

00:16:35.536 --> 00:16:38.080
All that fighting's turned
your brains to applesauce.

00:16:45.338 --> 00:16:48.132
- Do you yield, dragon whore?
- Eat shit, Sarrah!

00:16:48.216 --> 00:16:50.718
Serving boy! My cup.

00:17:10.988 --> 00:17:12.990
Have you no shame coming here?

00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:17.912
Those men are dead because of you.

00:17:24.961 --> 00:17:26.546
Will you take Egg to squire?

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:32.635
I told your father.

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:35.429
He's not my concern.

00:17:37.223 --> 00:17:39.183
You know...

00:17:39.267 --> 00:17:41.894
My brother wasn't always
such a little monster.

00:17:43.604 --> 00:17:44.939
Egg is no monster.

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:46.857
He's just a boy.

00:17:46.941 --> 00:17:48.358
I didn't mean Egg.

00:17:48.442 --> 00:17:51.612
But no doubt we'll make a man of him, too.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:59.245
Perhaps the seeds of madness
are sown in the womb, as the maesters say.

00:18:02.373 --> 00:18:04.458
But Aerion was quite the glad child once.

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:07.253
He liked fishing.

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.292
What?

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:13.295
Ser Duncan, my lord, requests an audience.

00:20:28.853 --> 00:20:31.772
I want you to know I do not blame you
for ruining my name day.

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:35.484
It was a rotten thing they've done to you,
and you were right in your reply.

00:20:38.571 --> 00:20:39.572
Thanks.

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:49.832
Speak quick. I'm near rid of this place.

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.459
Before your brother died,

00:20:52.543 --> 00:20:54.419
he said the realm needed good men.

00:20:54.503 --> 00:20:55.671
What of it?

00:20:56.881 --> 00:20:58.507
I will take Egg to squire.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.469
But not at Summerhall.

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:05.597
I thought you were done with princes.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:06.974
Egg is no prince.

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:08.976
Not yet.

00:21:10.895 --> 00:21:14.064
Might be he's better served
away from castles,

00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:16.609
- and servants, and--
- His family?

00:21:22.698 --> 00:21:24.283
If you would consent...

00:21:25.951 --> 00:21:28.204
I would bring him on the road with me.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:30.706
He'll learn to squire as I did.

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:34.919
We'll sleep in inns, stables.

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:40.632
Now and again, in the halls
of some landed knight

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:42.134
or lesser lordling.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.805
Maybe under a tree, when we must.

00:21:46.889 --> 00:21:49.683
I forbid him to live as a peasant.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.269
Aegon is blood of the dragon.

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:57.775
He cannot sleep in ditches
and eat hard salt beef.

00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:03.906
Daeron never slept in a ditch.

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:09.078
And all the beef Aerion ever ate was

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:11.789
thick and rare and bloody.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:25.177
He's my last son.

00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:49.159
Sweetfoot!

00:22:53.914 --> 00:22:55.082
What are you doing here, girl?

00:22:59.378 --> 00:23:01.838
I hear Ser Lyonel wants you for a stag.

00:23:01.922 --> 00:23:04.090
Storm End's a sad place.

00:23:04.174 --> 00:23:06.218
Figured an old friend
might brighten it up for you.

00:23:09.388 --> 00:23:11.181
You bought me a horse?

00:23:16.312 --> 00:23:17.771
I won't be going with Lyonel.

00:23:20.608 --> 00:23:22.275
What will you do then?

00:23:22.359 --> 00:23:23.736
What I should have done all along.

00:23:25.321 --> 00:23:27.072
Ride her in the other direction.

00:23:29.283 --> 00:23:31.243
What about you?

00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:33.036
I don't know.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.373
Father always spoke about
building up the cider business,

00:23:36.457 --> 00:23:38.667
opening a new barreling outfit.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.211
Cider?

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.133
Well, you should have your
Sweetfoot back, in any matter.

00:23:51.764 --> 00:23:52.890
She's not mine.

00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:55.309
Not anymore.

00:23:58.812 --> 00:23:59.813
Besides...

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:02.983
I think an orchard might suit her better.

00:24:04.485 --> 00:24:06.319
What?

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:07.863
I can't.

00:24:09.365 --> 00:24:10.449
Are you certain?

00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:14.286
She is a fine animal.

00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:18.874
Hello there, Sweetfoot.
Do you like apples?

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.384
I don't know, Chestnut. Stop asking me.

00:25:55.721 --> 00:25:57.765
Where would the old man go? Hm?

00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:05.314
Ser Duncan!

00:26:09.735 --> 00:26:11.695
My lord father says I am to serve you.

00:26:21.497 --> 00:26:24.083
"Serve you, ser."

00:26:25.626 --> 00:26:28.212
Chestnut's yours. Treat her kindly.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:32.508
And I don't want to find you on Thunder
unless I put you there.

00:26:35.052 --> 00:26:36.512
Where are we going, ser?

00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:38.972
Don't know.

00:26:40.808 --> 00:26:42.851
I suppose we could go anywhere
in the Seven Kingdoms,

00:26:42.935 --> 00:26:44.353
- though I've never been to D--
- Nine.

00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:49.858
- What?
- There are nine kingdoms, ser.

00:26:50.984 --> 00:26:53.403
- Of what?
- The realm.

00:26:55.405 --> 00:26:56.698
Are you mad?

00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:58.241
Is that relevant?

00:26:58.325 --> 00:27:00.618
There are seven kingdoms of the realm, boy.

00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:02.120
Everyone knows that.

00:27:02.204 --> 00:27:04.998
- Then, everyone is wrong.
- Do you want a clout in the ear?

00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:08.084
Crownlands, Westerlands,
Stormlands, Riverlands,

00:27:08.168 --> 00:27:10.462
the Iron Islands, the North, the Reach,

00:27:10.546 --> 00:27:12.422
the Vale of Arryn, and Dorne.

00:27:16.635 --> 00:27:18.470
No, but...

00:27:18.554 --> 00:27:21.389
I've never been over
the Red Mountains before.

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:23.725
I hear they have good puppet shows in Dorne.

00:28:20.449 --> 00:28:21.658
Hyah! Hyah!

00:28:25.871 --> 00:28:28.206
- Where's Aegon?
- I've not seen him, my prince.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:29.875
I will ask the septons.

00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:34.421
Where the fuck is he?!
