[THE DEVIL BETWEEN US]

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.020
[Episode 6]

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.509
Is Dr. Zhang Xue in?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.800
I'm Zhang Xue.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.120
Hello, Dr. Zhang.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.570
Hello.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.960
I'm a relative of the patient, Xue Jiang.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.510
The case of congenital heart disease

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:03.230
with a lung infection?

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.950
Right.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.470
Are you

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.350
his father?

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.070
I'm not his father.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.039
I'm his uncle.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.419
I've been here a few times,

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:10.479
but we haven't met.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.310
Is something the matter?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.070
I wanted to ask about the situation.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.960
Regarding the child,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.520
I see

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.790
he's recovering well recently.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.870
Yes.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.290
Does this mean he can be discharged?

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.780
He's just improved.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.310
A decision on discharge
hasn't been made yet.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.310
Did you change the treatment plan?

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.040
No.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.160
It's been anti-inflammatory
treatment all along.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.150
The treatment hasn't changed.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.950
Then how did he suddenly get better?

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.900
His own immunity probably improved.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.770
Isn't improvement a good thing?

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:46.800
It is.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:47.760
It is.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.280
So,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.470
after this,

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.480
judging by the current situation,

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.720
is he in the clear?

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.460
We certainly

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.610
can't make that conclusion right now.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.890
Because his heart
and lung functions are very poor.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.030
We definitely need
to observe him for a while longer.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.230
It's hard to say what will happen later.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.330
So there's still a possibility
of deterioration?

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.460
That's very likely.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.110
First of all,

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.240
the patient's underlying
condition is poor,

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.670
right?

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:16.130
Right.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.910
So,

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.870
if

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.800
anything goes wrong
or he's not careful,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.730
there is definitely

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.990
a risk of the infection worsening again.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.240
If it gets worse again...

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.660
I mean if

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.810
it gets worse again,

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.800
can he survive it?

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:33.030
Or can he

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.400
hold on for a long time?

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.530
Are you really the child's uncle?

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.280
Yes, I am.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.950
Why do I feel like

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.360
you don't want the patient to get better?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.030
I do want him to get better.

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.560
Of course I do.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.680
I really do.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.920
It's just that he's been sick for years.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.940
The family is anxious,

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.340
and the child is pitiful.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.079
My sister

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.190
and brother-in-law have a heavy burden.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.030
I came to ask

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.079
just to be mentally prepared.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.040
Look,

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.840
as doctors,

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.900
we will definitely

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.830
do our best to help the patient.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:05.700
Right.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.690
As the child's uncle,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.800
we understand how you feel.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.560
But I think

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.280
your priority right now

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.520
is to take good care of the child.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.710
Make sure he eats well

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.870
to boost his immunity.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.269
Right?

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:16.730
Right.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.170
Don't overthink things for now, okay?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.660
Okay.

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.680
I...

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.020
I just have one last question.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.390
Hypothetically,

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.320
if the illness recurs,

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.170
will it be worse than before?

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.159
If that really happens,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.360
I will inform the child's parents.

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.040
Right.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.590
Right.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.090
I have other work to do.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.920
So...

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:43.470
Okay.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.320
Thank you.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.970
Thanks.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.980
What's wrong?

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.240
What's wrong, Mr. Xue?

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.530
What's going on?

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.160
Is there a misunderstanding?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.330
Cheng, do I have a blood feud with you?

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:05.330
You were cursing my son like that?

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.970
No.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.670
I...

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.600
I came to find the doctor

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.000
to ask about the child's condition.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.680
Bullshit!

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.600
I heard everything.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.530
You're just after my son's kidney.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.060
You look like an honest man.

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:16.750
Why are you so scheming?

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:17.980
You're truly bad.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.430
I'm sorry.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:26.600
Sorry for what?

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.800
Is sorry useful?

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.140
What are you sorry for?

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:30.820
I didn't think that before.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.240
I really didn't think that way.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:34.990
I just found out too.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.560
Jiang and Jiajia...

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.630
Their six HLA points

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.870
are a perfect match.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.000
A perfect match.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.270
The probability is very low.

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.190
The children are connected by fate.

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.040
You're still talking?

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.630
Still talking?

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:47.870
Believe it or not, I'll beat you up!

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:48.720
I believe you.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.560
I believe you.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.000
Mr. Xue.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.560
You...

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.240
Just beat me.

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.150
Just beat me.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:54.800
Please.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:55.390
I beg you.

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.190
I beg you for one thing.

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.310
I beg you for one thing.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.440
Mr. Xue, I'm just asking for one thing.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.750
The child...

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:02.750
I...

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:03.560
I pray...

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:06.470
I pray the child lives
a long life and stays safe.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.520
If Jiang can pull through,

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.510
pretend I never said anything.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:11.630
I said nothing.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.960
Treat me like a bastard.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:13.880
A bastard!

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:14.970
A bastard.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.430
But if...

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.960
just in case...

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.720
can you pity me?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.070
Have pity...

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:27.560
have pity on Jiajia, please?

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:29.000
Jiajia is only nine.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.240
Jiajia is only nine.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.950
That child...

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.390
I'll give you any amount you want.

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.480
I'll give you money, okay?

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.140
Do you think I need your money?

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.870
I don't need your money!

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.630
Tell me.

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.750
To you, is my son

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:41.000
not even a person?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.390
Just a kidney?

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.800
No.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:43.870
Your daughter is a person,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:44.750
but my son isn't,

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.350
is that it?

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:46.240
Don't be angry.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.070
Is that right?

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.870
Don't be angry.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.310
Hit me.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.720
How can I not be angry?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.380
I'm telling you.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.400
Take your daughter and get lost.

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.360
If I find out you're still after my son,

00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.560
I'll kill you.

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.750
Get lost!

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.650
Mr. Xue.

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:01.310
Mr. Xue.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.430
Please reconsider.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.310
Reconsider my ass!

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.160
Just think about it.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.270
Think about it!

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:07.870
What are you looking at?

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.220
Dad, what happened to your face?

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.940
I just fell on the stairs.

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:32.670
Does it hurt?

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:35.930
It hurts.

The answers were hidden.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:08:59.870
Where did you copy this from?

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:02.340
We did it on our own ability.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.150
Fine.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.870
Then tell me,

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.130
what is the logic here?

00:09:08.390 --> 00:09:09.200
Explain it.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.630
Come on, tell me yours.

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.650
How did you solve this?

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:15.310
Why did you write it like this?

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.010
I don't know how.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.150
I copied it.

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:21.610
Where did you copy it from?

00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:27.630
Let me see it.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.080
Nothing.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080
Let me take a look.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:36.600
Who bought this?

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.630
Grandpa bought it.

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.000
Here, take this page.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.480
Rewrite it.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:48.770
Finish answering this whole page for me.

00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:51.660
Finish this page.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:52.510
Hurry up.

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.710
I'll check it in a bit.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.280
Pick up the pen.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.470
Dad.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.040
What?

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.530
Did you buy this for them?

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.030
I bought it.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.160
Why did you buy this?

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.120
E-learning is popular now.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:08.150
The school encourages buying these.

00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.550
Why would the school make you buy this?

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:10.480
To play with?

00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.630
It's an educational tablet.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.030
Education requires the right methods.

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.220
Since when do you know about methods?

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:23.870
Let me tell you.

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:25.030
Recently,

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:27.000
I read some books on parenting.

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:28.960
I'll organize them when I'm free.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.770
I'll teach you personally

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:33.470
and show you what a real pro is.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.670
Here.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:37.410
Have some grapes.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.940
Did you do something wrong?

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.670
Nonsense. I'm such a good person.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.070
Would I do something bad?

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.270
You're helping educate the kids,

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:44.240
and washing grapes for me.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:44.840
You're acting suspicious.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.170
You're never like this.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:48.300
That's why I call you an ingrate.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.870
I saw how stressed you are at work,

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:52.730
so I wanted to help share the load.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.910
But you turn it around,

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:54.910
making it look like I did something bad.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.970
Is this that police mindset of yours?

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.840
The towering image
of your father in your heart...

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:01.220
now...

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.620
now...

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:03.150
has...

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:04.210
become this small?

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:06.150
Alright, I misunderstood you.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.760
That's more like it.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.400
Here, have some more.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:10.790
Actually,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:13.170
I wanted to ask you about some gossip.

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.800
I heard Wang Ping is on drugs too.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:19.360
Who told you that?

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.150
People at the electronics factory said so.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.600
Well...

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.270
Nuanfeng County is such a small place.

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:24.120
Good news doesn't travel,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.120
but this kind of thing spreads fast.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.690
Stop listening to their gossip.

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.390
Didn't she take it by accident?

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.510
She took it by mistake.

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.790
She even gave us clues for the case.

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.320
Accidental or not, it's still drugs.

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:40.120
Drugs are terrible.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.080
They spread so fast.

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.480
It seems like there's another case nearby.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:45.150
Wait.

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.880
Why are you investigating a drug case?

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.880
Isn't that for the narcotics squad?

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.320
Well.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.240
The narcotics squad has a big case.

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.150
They're short-handed.

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.510
So we...

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:57.110
We were transferred to help.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.320
They pull you in just because
they're short-handed?

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:00.790
Those...

00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:02.750
...drug dealers are all desperadoes.

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.350
They kill without blinking.

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.160
Why not...

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.880
...take leave to look after the kids?

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:12.090
Wouldn't that get you out of this?

00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:13.150
Don't tell me what to do.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:14.870
I fought for this opportunity.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.550
Why would I take leave?

00:12:15.550 --> 00:12:16.910
I'm perfectly fine.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:18.720
Look.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.510
I know you're ambitious.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:21.960
But you have to think about it.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:23.550
You have two kids at home.

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:25.300
You work so hard every day.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.770
What if you get injured or disabled?

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:29.030
Or if you sacrifice...

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:30.080
Here we go again.

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.480
Or if you become a martyr?

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:32.530
A martyr.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.530
What if?

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:36.320
Who will take care of Ming and Zhi?

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.650
I'm already at this age.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.550
Who will run this house?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.120
Why would I become a martyr?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.630
I haven't died all these years.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:42.320
Why would I now?

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.270
I won't die.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:45.120
I wondered why you
were suddenly so helpful.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.510
Washing grapes for me
and helping with the kids.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:48.150
I was just making an analogy.

00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:49.830
You don't appreciate my kindness.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:51.090
You're unbelievable.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:58.160
[MIX CLUB]

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:25.550
If Tang Sile wasn't

00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:27.150
coming to the bar that night,

00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:30.990
where was he heading?

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:43.750
Was he just passing by?

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.200
A coincidence?

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.070
I don't think so.

00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.310
I don't think so.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.960
Jinbao Street.

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.380
Stop thinking about it.

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.230
Even I don't think about it anymore.

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:46.150
Look at me.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:47.450
Having one eye left

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.030
is better than losing both.

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:50.000
Isn't it?

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:50.920
Right?

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.960
It's the same with eating tangerines.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.550
Look.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:56.320
Eating two segments at once

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:57.850
is too much to swallow.

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.000
Eating them one by one

00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:00.930
is just right.

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.990
Twenty years old.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.480
It's a pity.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.330
Come over here

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.110
to the billiards hall
on the second floor above the bar.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.920
Is it urgent?

00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.880
It takes 40 minutes from downtown.

00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:24.820
It's okay. You have time.

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.610
Okay.

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:27.890
Got a lead?

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:30.670
Alright.

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.160
I won't peel the tangerine for you.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.120
I have to go.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:34.900
Longzheng.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.070
Hu Wenjing

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.550
is a bit aggressive at work,

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.640
but regarding your brother's incident,

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.640
she really had nothing to do with it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.990
At work,

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.650
don't always give her attitude.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:52.600
It's in the past.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.800
You have to look forward.

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.720
Got it, Ke.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:29.800
You scared me.

00:16:30.390 --> 00:16:31.550
It really took you 40 minutes to get here.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.510
I waited for a whole 40 minutes.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:33.390
I told you.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:34.120
40 minutes.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:34.440
What's wrong?

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:35.270
What clue?

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.430
You go first.

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:38.960
Start the game.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.270
What do you mean?

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.030
There's something wrong with this shop?

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:44.860
There's nothing wrong with this shop.

00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:45.740
Just play.

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:59.790
Look down from the glass behind me.

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:01.630
See how many shops you can spot.

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.010
A restaurant, a hotel,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.550
a nail salon, a milk tea shop,

00:17:20.550 --> 00:17:21.500
and a supermarket.

00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.060
So?

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:24.550
Among these shops,

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:26.000
which one do you think is suspicious?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:26.790
Can you tell?

00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:29.520
What do you mean?

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:30.300
Your turn.

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.110
I've been watching here all day.

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.440
There are always people

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:46.730
driving here to buy milk tea.

00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:50.720
So what?

00:17:51.490 --> 00:17:53.090
Maybe their milk tea is good.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.070
The customers are mostly

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:56.750
older people.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:57.510
Mostly middle-aged.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:58.910
Hardly any young people.

00:18:00.030 --> 00:18:00.590
Look at

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.680
what milk tea

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.010
the young people here bought.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:04.670
It's not from that shop at all.

00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:06.720
I just checked.

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:07.810
This milk tea shop

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.090
doesn't offer delivery.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.010
Dine-in only.

00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.310
If their milk tea is really that good,

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.710
why wouldn't they want the delivery sales?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.460
Let's take a break.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.010
Actually, it's about Tang Sile.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:25.130
Actually, for Tang Sile, the bar

00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:26.390
and this milk tea shop

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:27.850
are in the same direction.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:30.600
And Liu Qiang.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.950
Liu Qiang didn't use to go to bars.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:34.080
Is it possible that

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.590
he bought drugs nearby,

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:37.320
didn't want to use them at home,

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:39.660
so he went to this bar to do it?

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.200
Is that possible?

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.850
You want to buy a cup
of milk tea to check it out,

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:05.390
but you're afraid of being recognized,
so you want me to go?

00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.760
Smart.

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.950
Yes, that's exactly it.

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.200
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.400
I'm saying it now.

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.460
Finish this round.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.150
We've only got 20 minutes left.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.240
I'll go now.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.800
It's expensive for an hour.

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.040
I'm all alone here...

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:33.890
Hello.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:34.990
Buying milk tea?

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.250
Yes.

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.460
I'll take two drinks.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:41.770
Do you have any recommendations?

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.290
The original flavor is good.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.510
I'll have an original one.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.370
Anything else?

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.510
Business is really good today.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.620
How about I add some new toppings?

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.420
One with coconut jelly,

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:51.460
and one with bubbles.

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.060
Okay.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.210
I'd like it that way.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:05.590
I'll also have an order

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:07.480
of this signature fried chicken.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:09.410
We're out of that.

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:11.620
What about french fries?

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.240
Fried food is all sold out today.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.540
Come early tomorrow if you want some.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.070
We have them in the morning.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.400
Your business is so good?

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.530
How much is the rent?

00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:23.680
I'm just an employee.

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:25.510
You'd have to ask the boss that.

00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:27.040
I'm not really sure either.

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:30.270
Why?

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.020
You want to open a shop here?

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:32.720
Yes.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.980
I'm thinking about it.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.410
It's nice here.

00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:38.750
Lots of young people.

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.990
Look over there.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.570
KTVs, bars, pool halls.

00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:45.080
We have them all.

00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.210
Young people are the big spenders now.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.860
When does it usually get busy?

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.200
Usually around 7 or 8 PM.

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:55.710
And weekends get really busy.

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:57.720
Here's the receipt.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.550
Do you scan me or do I scan you?

00:20:58.550 --> 00:20:59.400
I'll scan you.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:02.240
Okay.

00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:02.960
It went through.

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:03.390
Okay.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:03.940
Thanks.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.160
Hope to see you again.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.840
Well?

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.040
Something is a bit off.

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:31.430
Their menu is very limited.

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.280
I chatted with the guy.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.380
He said he's not the boss.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.840
Didn't get much out of him.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.410
Does the shop have a back room?

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.070
Yeah. Separated by a curtain.

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:41.790
Did he get the milk tea from the back,

00:21:41.790 --> 00:21:42.880
or just from the front?

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880
Right from the front.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.550
Didn't go to the back?

00:21:44.550 --> 00:21:45.110
No.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:57.610
This...

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.830
This is way too sweet.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:00.720
It's cloying.

00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:01.850
It tastes terrible.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.630
What is this stuff?

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:06.110
It's bad, isn't it?

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:08.710
That's the problem.

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:10.040
For something this bad,

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:12.240
why do those people drive here to buy it,

00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.970
getting several cups at a time?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.960
I observed them before.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.470
Don't they have a back room?

00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:20.510
Usually for those customers,

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:23.550
the clerk gets it from the back.

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.200
I suspect

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:27.790
either

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.440
when they come to buy,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.160
they have a referral,

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:32.610
or there's a secret code.

00:22:32.610 --> 00:22:33.990
For regular customers like you,

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:35.740
you just get actual milk tea.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:43.400
It really is bad.

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.270
How much per cup?

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.100
Ten yuan.

00:22:45.130 --> 00:22:46.140
Twenty for two.

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.640
That's 20 wasted.

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:51.330
So what's the plan?

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.130
Get someone to raid the place?

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:56.480
It's pointless to raid this place now.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.030
The clerk told the truth about one thing.

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.030
He's not the boss.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.920
If you

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.070
bust the place now,

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:03.480
you'll only end up
with this lousy milk tea.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.230
We need to catch the mastermind.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:16.260
Could the boss be Ding Lai?

00:23:16.510 --> 00:23:17.920
Whether it's Ding Lai or not,

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.510
if I were the boss,

00:23:19.510 --> 00:23:20.350
I'd definitely find a spot

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.100
where I could keep an eye on the shop.

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.830
That way, if anything happens,

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:24.880
I'll know immediately

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:26.350
and can make a run for it.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.880
The problem is, there are too many spots

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.520
that have a view of this shop.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.750
There must be hundreds
or thousands of them.

00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:36.480
Where do we even start looking?

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:38.880
If we do a massive search,

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.220
we'll just alert them.

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.310
They'll definitely run
as soon as they catch wind of it.

00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:46.200
So what should we do now?

00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:48.920
Let me think.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.770
The car's there.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.900
Everyone's here then.

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:01.720
This is Mr. Gu.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.370
Liu.

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.200
Ms. Zhang.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:03.800
Ms. Wang.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.550
Ms. Zhao.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:05.830
Let's get started.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.260
The old buildings you mentioned earlier

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.110
are the former staff
housing for the paper mill.

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:13.180
There are 398 households in total.

00:24:13.210 --> 00:24:14.690
Building 4, Unit 1.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:15.830
The curtains are all drawn here.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:16.810
We can't see anything.

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:17.920
Let's mark it as suspicious.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.790
In the last year,

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:19.830
through my shop,

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:21.270
we've sold about 4 units,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:22.670
and rented out 6.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.120
Many landlords and tenants
contact each other directly.

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.030
Building 5, Room 602.

00:24:27.050 --> 00:24:29.620
There are lots of toys on the windowsill.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:30.920
Let's rule this one out.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.720
The neighborhood committee

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:33.440
just did a census last month.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:34.790
Ms. Wang, you're so reliable.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.720
Come on, bring it here.

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:36.160
Bring it here.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.620
I know this place too well.

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:39.240
I recognize this family.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.240
The couple are doctors.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:43.070
They've lived here for many years.

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:44.160
Cross it off.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:47.000
Building 5, Room 602.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:48.750
This family put up new paper cutouts.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:50.160
Doesn't seem like a problem.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:50.680
This one.

00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.790
I know this family.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.190
It's my grandson's teacher.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.920
When I go grocery shopping,

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:54.920
I always see them.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:55.450
So, what do you think?

00:24:55.450 --> 00:24:56.480
Are they good?

00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:59.130
I'm blown away.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:00.610
Building 5, Room 701.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.490
Building 5, Room 701.

00:25:01.490 --> 00:25:02.140
Upstairs.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:03.370
Upstairs, next door.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.720
What's wrong?

00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:10.030
There's a gap

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:12.080
in the curtains.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.170
That means

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:14.440
I can see him,

00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:15.160
and he can see me.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.810
Otherwise, why leave a gap?

00:25:17.310 --> 00:25:18.590
Mark down 701.

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:18.920
Okay.

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.680
Building 5, 701.

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.960
Which ones are suspicious now?

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.520
The suspicious one
is Building 4, Unit 1, 304.

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.790
-The suspect is Building 5, 701.
-Building 5, 701.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:29.510
Okay, I'll ask Zhang Yan.

00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.440
I'll have Zhang Yan check it.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:37.960
Zhang Yan.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.360
Come to the East Lane
behind Jinbao Street.

00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:43.720
Hello, sir.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.970
I'm from
the county public security bureau.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:47.680
I'm here to ask you a few questions.

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.280
What is it?

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:51.270
You're the owner of
Room 701 in Building 5

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:53.000
on East Guangming Lane, right?

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.360
Yes.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.060
Do you live in this house now?

00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:59.600
No, I rented it out.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.430
How long has it been rented out?

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:02.920
Quite a while.

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.540
You know who the tenant is, right?

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.650
I saw her ID info.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:09.830
She's a woman.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.720
In her forties.

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:11.880
This is her.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:12.540
Take a look.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:21.710
Sir.

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:22.640
Hello.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:23.720
Excuse me.

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.350
Hello.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.930
Police.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.030
I need to ask you something.

00:26:27.030 --> 00:26:28.000
Have you ever delivered to

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.240
Room 701, Building 5,

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.920
and Room 304, Unit 1,

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.680
Building 4?

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.830
Let me check.

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.350
Okay.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.860
Room 701, Building 5.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.460
Room 304, Unit 1, Building 4.

00:26:44.090 --> 00:26:44.640
I've delivered to both.

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.440
Both, right?

00:26:45.550 --> 00:26:47.030
Do you remember anything?

00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:48.960
Like what they looked like?

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:52.540
Room 304, Unit 1, Building 4.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.010
Seems like a live streamer.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.730
A streamer?

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:56.520
A big fat guy.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:57.730
In his twenties.

00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:58.810
Sloppy.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.560
Plays games at home all day.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.950
Every time I deliver water,

00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:04.160
he opens the door
and runs back to his computer.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.530
I have to put the bottle
on for him every time.

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:07.870
So I remember him well.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:09.480
Twenties.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.410
A bit fat, right?

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:11.440
What about the other one?

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.310
Room 701?

00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.800
701.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.160
I don't think I've seen them.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.970
Never seen them?

00:27:18.970 --> 00:27:19.920
Didn't you deliver stuff?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:20.810
You didn't see them?

00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:23.070
They always ask me
to leave it at the door.

00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:26.400
Do you remember what they ordered?

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.330
Any impression?

00:27:29.630 --> 00:27:31.300
Just some food and drinks.

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.190
Is it all recorded here?

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:34.210
Can I take a look?

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:34.900
Go ahead.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.660
Room 701, Building 5.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:47.050
Three dozen beers.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.110
A 43-year-old woman living alone

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:50.870
ordered 3 dozen beers for herself?

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:52.590
I'll have someone check it.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.160
Wenjing.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.030
Fengnan.

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:00.400
Check this number.

00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:01.550
194...

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:02.340
223...

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:03.640
83765.

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:08.910
Okay, thanks, sir.

00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:10.210
By the way,

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:12.160
regarding what we asked today,

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:13.010
don't tell anyone.

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:13.690
Keep it confidential.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:14.320
Okay?

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:15.790
Got it.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.360
The owner is Sun Wenquan.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.600
Male, 35.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.310
From Hongdao Township,
Nuanhai Town, Nuanhai County.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.510
A true local.

00:28:22.510 --> 00:28:23.840
Unemployed, no record.

00:28:24.850 --> 00:28:25.610
Okay.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.600
Got it.

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:28.160
Thanks.

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:30.680
What did she say?

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.270
The actual tenant

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:33.240
is Sun Wenquan.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.550
35, local.

00:28:34.550 --> 00:28:35.560
Unemployed drifter.

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.030
He used someone else's ID

00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.320
to rent the apartment.

00:28:38.490 --> 00:28:39.310
Whose ID did he use?

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.550
This 43-year-old woman's.

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:44.210
This looks very suspicious
at first glance.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:45.720
I saw Liu Yi's interrogation report

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.440
at the detachment.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:48.240
Liu Yi confessed

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.150
that there is a person in Ding Lai's gang

00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:51.480
whose nickname is Quan.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.880
Nicknamed Quan?

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.160
Yes.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.440
This guy's name is Sun Wenquan.

00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.570
Quan is Sun Wenquan?

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:56.400
It's the same person.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.060
No wonder it was hard to find him.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:28:59.070
We couldn't find Ding Lai

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:01.070
because Quan hid him.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.750
We can't just go in
and drag him out right now.

00:29:04.310 --> 00:29:04.960
Let's do it tomorrow.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.030
Let's report this immediately.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.400
Let Director Dai come tomorrow.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.810
Okay.

00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:08.900
You go

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.310
and talk to the boss.

00:29:10.330 --> 00:29:10.990
I already did.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.660
To keep it confidential?

00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:12.470
Yes, I told him.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:13.270
Let's go then.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.570
I'm just here to see the child.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:25.790
I'll just see the kid and go.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:26.480
I just wanted to know where you live.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:27.940
I'll come visit you often.

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:39.870
Jiajia.

00:29:40.270 --> 00:29:40.790
Jiajia.

00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:42.200
Daddy's going to take out the trash.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.720
You play with Xiaoyu here.

00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:44.890
I'll be right back.

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.830
Sorry.

00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:57.510
It's okay.

00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:11.250
Ken.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.080
Going out?

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:13.290
Just taking a walk.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:13.840
Keeping busy?

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.370
Go ahead.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:39.310
Come and look.

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.230
Does it fit well?

00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:44.820
Why are you spacing out?

00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:47.790
Your phone keeps ringing,
but you won't answer it.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:51.240
Is it your ex-husband?

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.800
It's my online business group.

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:58.450
There's a gathering in a few days.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:31:59.620
They insist that I go.

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:00.730
At a time like this,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:02.090
I'm in no mood to reply.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:03.490
Reply.

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:05.050
Just say you're going.

00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:06.350
By then,

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.910
you might already be at Maide.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:09.370
You're famous in Nuanhai.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.410
At the party,
even though you won't be there,

00:32:11.410 --> 00:32:13.480
everyone will be talking about you.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:14.880
That's so cool.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.400
Do you have to work with Quan?

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:24.680
Quan has always been a drug dealer.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:26.480
If the cops find him,

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.370
we're done for.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:32.880
You're scared of everything.

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.080
How can we make it big?

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:35.880
Besides,

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:37.160
Quan and I

00:32:37.310 --> 00:32:38.840
might not even make a deal.

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:41.100
We'll just run away tonight.

00:32:41.890 --> 00:32:43.350
Have you packed your bags?

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.230
Not really.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.850
Didn't you say
I didn't need to bring anything?

00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.830
It's best not to bring anything.

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.240
As long as you have money,

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.440
you can buy anything.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.480
Here.

00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:56.110
I'll send you a location later.

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:57.970
Bring the money and meet me there.

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:00.880
If

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:02.920
I reach a deal with Quan,

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:04.280
I'll call you.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.080
If not,

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:07.630
I'll come find you,

00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:11.270
and we'll head straight to the pier.

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.120
Aren't you afraid

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.000
I'll run away with the money?

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.760
This isn't much money.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:28.650
One full meal versus
a lifetime of full meals.

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:31.250
You can tell the difference,
right, Li Xiaoya?

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:34.480
Of course.

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:36.680
I finally found a chance

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.810
to change my destiny.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.920
I'm definitely going to seize it.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.160
I just didn't expect

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:46.930
you to trust me this much.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.720
We're lovebirds sharing the same fate.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.480
If we die,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.990
we die together.

00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.960
Xiaoya.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.090
Give me a hug.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:23.060
Good luck.

00:34:24.590 --> 00:34:25.550
Good luck to us.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.440
Come on.

00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:38.550
Turn around.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:44.159
What's this for?

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.320
If the police catch me,

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:48.110
or if I die in an accident,

00:34:48.370 --> 00:34:49.110
the police will also

00:34:49.110 --> 00:34:50.710
find you based on this photo.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.330
You won't be able to escape.

00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:57.800
You're trying to drag someone down

00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:59.670
with you, aren't you?

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:00.750
Isn't that great?

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.800
I won't be lonely on the way there.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.440
I don't trust anyone.

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:07.330
Because I've seen
the darkest side of human nature.

00:35:07.690 --> 00:35:09.330
If you don't want anything to happen,

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:12.260
take the money
and wait for me at the designated spot.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.570
Pray that everything goes well for me.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:16.470
When you pray,

00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:20.830
be sincere.

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:21.770
Because...

00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:24.350
sincerity makes it work.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:35.440
Why are you just standing there?

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.070
Go.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:53.510
It's nothing.

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.480
Sorry.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:38.490
[Zebin Billiard Room]

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.580
Hello.

00:37:50.070 --> 00:37:51.880
A bottle of Fenjiu.

00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.560
Six bags of chicken feet.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.240
Two bags of braised beef.

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:00.330
Okay.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.490
Where to?

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:07.550
Building 5, 701.

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.430
The shop is a bit busy right now.

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.600
Would you mind waiting a moment?

00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:20.350
Leave it at the door?

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.420
Sure thing.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:25.230
701, Building 5.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.840
701?

00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:26.530
701.

00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:30.360
If you catch the bad guys,
give me a banner.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.340
Hu Wenjing.

00:38:34.570 --> 00:38:35.700
We have a situation.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.880
So you're saying,

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:39.480
we have to hit the milk tea shop
and 701 at the same time.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.840
Because they're watching
out for each other.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:41.800
If one side gets raided,

00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.000
the other might flee.

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.810
I suggest

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:44.610
we take 701 first.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.150
The people in the milk tea shop can't run.

00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:47.030
But there's a problem.

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.070
The entrance to the 7th-floor unit

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:49.630
is right behind the milk tea shop.

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.880
If we make a big scene,

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:52.280
the milk tea shop people
will definitely notice.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.480
We'll spook them.

00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:55.590
I mean, I'll take two or three people.

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:56.230
We'll go in batches,

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.670
and go up to handle it.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:38:58.560
No way.

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.200
You don't know
how many people are hiding in 701,

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:02.150
or what weapons they have.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.810
What if there are casualties?

00:39:05.070 --> 00:39:06.070
Then don't go.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:06.960
Let's just not do it.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:07.480
Let's do nothing.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.440
Just stay here.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.590
When did I say we shouldn't
do it and just stay here?

00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:12.590
That's what I'm saying.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:13.510
There's danger everywhere.

00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:15.110
I know what you mean.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:16.960
I'm asking the city for backup.

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.710
I'll get them to come
for a joint operation.

00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:20.400
Don't go reporting it all around again.

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.550
By the time you're done,

00:39:21.550 --> 00:39:22.400
everyone will have fled
and it'll be too late.

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:23.000
It's such a small matter.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.840
Why can't you just make a decision?

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.440
Hu Wenjing.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.550
Don't be rash just because
you're eager to take credit.

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.030
You know?

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.760
Dai.

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.190
Do you think I'm eager to take credit?

00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:33.630
Don't you know why
I became a police officer?

00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:35.320
I admit when I first
became a police officer,

00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.280
it was just to make a living.

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:38.510
But keeping the peace

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:39.880
has always been my dream.

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.380
I know you'll laugh at me for saying this.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:42.110
But it doesn't matter.

00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:43.440
I really mean it.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.220
Ding Lai's case has already
claimed 3 lives.

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.230
It's not a small matter.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:48.550
It's a thorn in my side.

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:50.310
I must catch Ding Lai.

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.190
But since there's a chance today,

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:53.030
I'm going today.

00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.840
I'm going right now.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:55.110
I won't miss any chance

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.000
to catch him.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.840
Can we stop being afraid of trouble?

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:01.360
What am I afraid of?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.190
Tell them to move out.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:03.860
Right.

00:40:15.700 --> 00:40:16.940
You must be Cheng Ken.

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.480
I am.

00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:20.630
And you are?

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.690
We're from the Group
Internal Audit Department.

00:40:23.890 --> 00:40:24.370
Hello.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:25.350
Is something wrong?

00:40:25.350 --> 00:40:26.310
Come with us.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.030
Let me finish this.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.030
Give me 2 minutes.
