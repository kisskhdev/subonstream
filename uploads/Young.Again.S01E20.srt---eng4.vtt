WEBVTT

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.860
That doesn't count!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.699
Ms. Cai cheated.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.960
Protest overruled.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.900
I declare...

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:14.680
Auntie Cai wins.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.419
She advances to the final against Professor Fan.

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:20.500
Great!

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:23.259
Professor Fan!

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.919
Auntie Cai!

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:25.080
Come on, Professor Fan!

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:26.639
Auntie Cai!

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.419
Auntie Cai!

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:29.400
Auntie Cai!

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:31.539
What's going on?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:32.360
Calm down.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.240
Calm down. Are you okay?

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.180
No need to compete.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.879
Xiao Cai is sure to be the champion.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.960
Not necessarily.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.340
I'm betting on Old Fan.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.060
This expert professor...

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.520
when it comes to useless things...

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:45.680
is particularly capable.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.360
I'll bet you ten bucks.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.599
You're on.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.659
Ready...

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.879
Go!

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:08.300
Mom

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.199
This kid

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:14.599
My son has come to see me

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:17.780
What are you doing?

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.680
Did Little Fox kick you out again?

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.400
No, Mom, I just missed you

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:22.699
I came over to see you

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.580
Shoo, you're making it up

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.259
Look at me

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.159
Look at this

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.099
It's not for you

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.439
Toothbrush, toothpaste

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.599
Undershirt, boxers

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.020
Why did you bring a towel blanket too?

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.159
Mom, you know how it is

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.500
If I don't have this in my mouth at night

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.759
I can't fall asleep

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.319
How embarrassing

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.000
Let's talk outside

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.520
Let's go

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:46.520
I announce

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.319
for this fun activity

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.039
the winner of the Staring Contest is

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.580
Mr. Fan Dacheng

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:53.199
Thank you, everyone

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.580
Thank you, everyone

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:57.020
Thank you

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.879
Wait

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:03.759
What's going on?

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.080
What's wrong?

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.780
Plain glasses

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.060
No prescription

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:11.419
Stop it, give me the glasses

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.439
He is nearsighted

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:14.520
Cheating

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.019
When he doesn't wear glasses

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.800
his eyes are no different from a blind person's

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.180
Cheating

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.199
This doesn't count

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.839
Doesn't count

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.439
Who said plain glasses aren't allowed?

00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:23.879
Hey, hand over the money

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:25.220
He is cheating

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.040
You're trying to get out of paying

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.259
Referee, uphold justice

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.740
Come on, take the money

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.740
Referee, you need to uphold justice

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.339
Money

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.980
I

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.819
We were just talking

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:32.680
I'll go check on Auntie Cai first

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:33.720
Talk later

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.000
No, you can't

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.740
Why did you think of wearing plain glasses?

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.600
Tell the truth

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.100
What is really going on?

00:04:41.459 --> 00:04:42.779
Nothing serious

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:45.079
It's just that Xiaoli likes bamboo mats

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.459
And I like grass mats

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.920
So we started bickering

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.899
Just over that?

00:04:49.899 --> 00:04:50.920
Was that necessary?

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.439
If it's bamboo, let it be bamboo

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:55.839
She put the bamboo mat on the floor

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.279
Is it uncomfortable to sleep on?

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.139
If it's uncomfortable

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:00.000
Why put a perfectly good thing on the floor?

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.000
I sleep on the floor!

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.519
Where's the bed?

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.060
Xiaoli and her mom sleep on the bed

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:06.399
How come?

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.439
Her mom moved into our house

00:05:08.579 --> 00:05:09.879
No, she didn't officially move in

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.420
She just came to help with the kid for a few days

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.240
Once the child's injury heals

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:13.800
she'll go back

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.379
What?

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:15.920
Doudou got hurt?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.160
Nothing serious, just got hit by a car

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:20.560
Mom

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:21.939
Mom, why did you faint?

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.759
Help!

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.459
Someone come quick!

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.519
Where?

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.620
Where's the fire?

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:39.939
Her blood pressure is a bit low

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.959
Nothing serious

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:43.579
She'll be fine after a rest

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.120
Thank you, doctor

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:45.759
No problem

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.800
Thank you for your trouble

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.899
It's my fault

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.459
I spoke too fast

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.379
I didn't have time to explain clearly

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:53.560
And my mom just collapsed

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.600
Actually,

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.600
it was Doudou driving a toy car

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.759
and crashing into another kid's toy car.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.240
He got a bump on his head.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:03.120
You wretched kid.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.480
You should have made that clear!

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.519
Look how you scared

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.220
me and your mom.

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:09.740
So what's with the injury on your head?

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.319
Didn't I just say?

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:11.959
It was Doudou,

00:06:11.959 --> 00:06:12.379
driving a toy car...

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:13.519
The injury on your head.

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.379
Oh, this?

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.300
Since Doudou got a bump on his head,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.319
my mother-in-law

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.180
insisted on coming over to help for a few days.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:22.699
It's fine that she came,

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.180
but she started nitpicking everything I did.

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.759
It was Hu Xiaoli who didn't watch the kid,

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.480
but she blamed it all on me.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.779
Insisted I don't care about the family.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:33.779
Said I don't sweep,

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:35.540
don't do dishes, don't cook.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.680
Me, cook?

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.199
When do I have time to cook?

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:39.680
I'm so busy!

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:40.660
Playing mahjong,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:42.139
playing poker,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.300
playing Fight the Landlord.

00:06:43.339 --> 00:06:45.319
Where would I find time to cook, right?

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:47.480
As we talked, things got heated.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.100
I went straight to the kitchen without a word.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.199
I grabbed a kitchen knife.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.560
Why bring a knife into it?

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.480
Let go of me.

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:54.439
I grabbed the kitchen knife

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:55.800
just to prove

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.040
that I can cook too!

00:06:58.279 --> 00:06:59.199
And then?

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.259
Then,

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:01.779
my mother-in-law had the same reaction as you.

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:02.899
She grabbed a frying pan

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:03.319
and just

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.639
whacked me right on the forehead.

00:07:05.899 --> 00:07:07.540
No matter how I explain, she won't listen.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.459
She insists that I attempted domestic violence.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.759
So she kicked me out.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.259
She's out of line!

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:17.800
I can beat my own son,

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.639
but no one else can.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.819
I'm going to fight her right now.

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.500
Give it a rest, Auntie Cai.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.920
Dabao's actions...

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.379
...really were easy to misunderstand.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.420
Well...

00:07:28.779 --> 00:07:29.500
Xiao Cai...

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:32.000
Don't you know Dabao's personality?

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.259
Would he dare grab a kitchen knife to fight someone?

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.519
His mother-in-law might not know,

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.860
but doesn't your wife know you?

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.720
Exactly!

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.399
When the old lady kicked you out,

00:07:40.399 --> 00:07:41.819
didn't your wife help you out?

00:07:41.939 --> 00:07:43.360
She did.

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:45.360
My toothbrush and underwear...

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.800
...she packed them for me.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.899
Pfft!

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:50.279
What good is a wife like that?

00:07:50.279 --> 00:07:51.759
Divorce! Divorce immediately!

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.060
Auntie Cai,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.920
you're usually the peacemaker.

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:55.959
How can you advise a divorce?

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.740
You're always saying,

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:58.920
"A short marriage creates deep bonds."

00:07:58.920 --> 00:07:59.839
"Better to destroy ten temples..."

00:07:59.839 --> 00:08:00.819
"...than to break up one marriage."

00:08:00.819 --> 00:08:01.680
How can we not break it?

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.100
His head is practically broken!

00:08:03.259 --> 00:08:04.720
And I should just swallow my anger?

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.860
Uncle Liang, say something to persuade her.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.139
They're ganging up to bully us!

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.459
Why wait? Divorce them!

00:08:10.959 --> 00:08:13.420
Dabao, if you don't divorce, you're not a man!

00:08:14.339 --> 00:08:15.439
All right, enough.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:16.680
Everyone, let's calm down first.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:19.040
Essentially, this is just a misunderstanding.

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:21.980
Even if we ignore your feelings as a couple,

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.439
you have to consider the child.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.860
Let me ask you, Dabao.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.079
Well,

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:26.980
isn't your wife the one raising the child?

00:08:27.459 --> 00:08:28.939
If you divorce in the future,

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:31.279
the court will surely award custody to her.

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:32.299
Auntie Cai,

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:33.519
then you won't be able to

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.679
see your grandson anymore.

00:08:34.899 --> 00:08:36.080
On what grounds?

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.679
Doudou's surname is Chen.

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.580
So of course,

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:39.779
custody should go to the Chen family!

00:08:39.779 --> 00:08:42.179
That's not how the law works, Auntie Cai.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.159
Who gets custody

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.259
depends on who the child lives with,

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:47.080
how old the child is,

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.379
and the child's own preference.

00:08:49.559 --> 00:08:50.820
It seems you don't believe me?

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.100
Fine.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.620
I'll go find the legal statutes for you.

00:08:54.899 --> 00:08:55.600
Before I get back,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.639
Auntie Cai, don't go anywhere.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.620
Hey, what?

00:09:00.259 --> 00:09:01.120
The book says,

00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.120
"Using fabricated facts or concealing the truth

00:09:05.159 --> 00:09:06.879
to obtain property

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.000
is called fraud."

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.100
Professor Fan's behavior...

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:12.460
...I'm letting him off easy by not suing him!

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.019
Mr. Li,

00:09:13.019 --> 00:09:14.759
aren't you exaggerating a bit?

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.000
You just want to get out of paying that ten yuan.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.679
No, seriously.

00:09:17.679 --> 00:09:18.220
After all this talk,

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.100
are you two really fighting over ten yuan?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.779
Why don't you two stop arguing?

00:09:21.779 --> 00:09:22.720
This ten yuan,

00:09:22.779 --> 00:09:23.720
I'll pay it, okay?

00:09:23.759 --> 00:09:24.480
No!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.779
Mom, don't cry.

00:09:28.019 --> 00:09:28.600
Mom!

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.500
How can I not cry?

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.419
Hu Xiaoli's family is bullying us!

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.559
If the court awards Doudou to them,

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:37.159
how am I supposed to live?

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.360
Little Cai, don't cry yet.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:43.659
Didn't Dr. Chang just say...

00:09:44.059 --> 00:09:45.899
Whoever the child lives with...

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:47.580
...is who the court will award custody to.

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.740
Right, he said that.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.279
We need to strike first.

00:09:51.559 --> 00:09:52.919
Let's get the child over here first.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.779
If the child lives with you...

00:09:54.779 --> 00:09:56.360
...the court will award him to you.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:57.620
Right.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.779
Your Uncle Liang's idea is right.

00:10:01.139 --> 00:10:01.620
No...

00:10:01.679 --> 00:10:03.480
What time is Doudou picked up every day?

00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.879
Every day...

00:10:05.019 --> 00:10:06.580
How would I know?

00:10:07.539 --> 00:10:08.080
Let's go.

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.840
Let's go snatch Doudou right now.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.340
Mom, will this work?

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:14.919
You just want to anger your mom to death.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:16.100
At a time like this...

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.100
...and you're still so spineless.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.519
Hurry up, let's go.

00:10:18.919 --> 00:10:19.399
Slow down.

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:19.899
Slow down.

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:21.840
Mom, are you really going?

00:10:22.179 --> 00:10:22.659
Yes.

00:10:22.659 --> 00:10:23.940
The book also said...

00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:24.539
Dr. Chang.

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:25.059
His behavior...

00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:25.820
You're just in time.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.639
Give us your opinion.

00:10:26.659 --> 00:10:27.220
Later.

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:28.019
I have something urgent right now.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:28.879
What?

00:10:29.019 --> 00:10:29.799
Old Chief.

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:30.759
This book...

00:10:30.779 --> 00:10:31.539
I'll borrow it for a moment.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.179
What?

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.299
What does this mean?

00:10:34.659 --> 00:10:36.480
He just took away my legal basis.

00:10:39.759 --> 00:10:41.139
Are you guys in cahoots?

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.059
Who's in cahoots?

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:44.840
President Li,

00:10:44.899 --> 00:10:46.740
have you developed senile paranoia?

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.080
Who?

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.860
Alright.

00:10:48.259 --> 00:10:48.960
I've decided.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.620
Professor Fan and Auntie Cai

00:10:50.679 --> 00:10:52.460
are joint champions of the Staring Contest.

00:10:52.659 --> 00:10:53.620
Is that acceptable now?

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:55.700
If that's the case,

00:10:56.019 --> 00:10:56.539
President Li,

00:10:56.639 --> 00:10:57.659
give me ten yuan first.

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:58.799
Then I'll give you ten yuan back.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.220
How can we do that?

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:02.539
If anyone's giving money,

00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:04.500
you should give me ten yuan first,

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:05.779
and then I'll give you ten yuan.

00:11:05.779 --> 00:11:07.120
No, it's me.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:07.600
Give it to me first.

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.860
What's the difference?

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:11.879
It cancels out either way.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.679
Is this really necessary?

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.879
Yes, it is.

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.159
Big brother, you can't go in.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:20.679
Brother, look here.

00:11:20.779 --> 00:11:22.259
I really am the child's parent.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.240
If you don't believe me, I'll recite my ID number.

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.620
One...

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.440
Don't.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:25.840
No need.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.600
Big brother, you didn't bring the pickup card.

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:28.340
You can't go in.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:29.220
Brother, look.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.460
My name is Dabao.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.759
My son is Doudou.

00:11:31.759 --> 00:11:33.440
Sounds like my kid, right?

00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:35.820
Look here...

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Darn it, why are they stopping him?

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.879
Dabao is probably usually busy with work.

00:11:41.059 --> 00:11:42.399
He doesn't come to pick up the child often.

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:43.799
So the security guard doesn't know him.

00:11:43.919 --> 00:11:44.740
What should we do?

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.139
Initiate the backup plan.

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:48.299
Big brother, we have rules here.

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.940
It's for the child's safety too.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.039
Consider my position too.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:51.980
Can you make an exception?

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:52.440
No.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.059
Can't do it.

00:11:53.059 --> 00:11:54.360
Just let me in.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:56.840
Come on.

00:11:56.899 --> 00:11:58.019
Come on.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:11:59.039
If everyone goes in,

00:11:59.039 --> 00:11:59.820
that would be bad.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.799
Then what am I here for?

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:01.679
What's the point of a guard?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:02.179
Right?

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.159
What are you laughing at?

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:07.580
Who are you guys?

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:08.639
You...

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.379
You tell him.

00:12:11.059 --> 00:12:12.159
This is...

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:13.779
What do you do?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.720
Rodent Control Office.

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:15.279
Right.

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.700
This is...

00:12:18.059 --> 00:12:19.659
Director Rat of the Grain Control Office.

00:12:21.019 --> 00:12:22.759
Comrade Liang of the Rodent Control Office.

00:12:23.159 --> 00:12:24.200
Rodent control.

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.940
Right.

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:26.639
Here to inspect your work.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:27.940
Young comrade.

00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.159
Hello.

00:12:30.519 --> 00:12:31.320
Hello.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:34.480
Your rodent control work...

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:35.519
is being done quite well.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:38.179
At least from what we can see now,

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.679
there aren't any rats nearby.

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.000
Thank you, leader.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.139
I haven't done anything.

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.080
Don't get arrogant just because of results.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.659
Regarding the rodent control work,

00:12:49.659 --> 00:12:51.879
I have a few points to emphasize.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.080
Point one.

00:12:54.559 --> 00:12:55.279
Point one...

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:57.740
That is, we must...

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.360
firmly grasp the rats' weaknesses.

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:00.559
The leader is talking to you.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:01.120
Go ahead.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:02.539
What weaknesses do rats have?

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:04.740
You tell him.

00:13:07.919 --> 00:13:10.100
Rats are also called mice

00:13:11.899 --> 00:13:12.860
Please leave immediately

00:13:13.259 --> 00:13:13.740
Teacher

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:15.659
I am Chen Doudou's father

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.580
Chen Doudou's mother told us

00:13:17.639 --> 00:13:19.659
that if anyone pretends to be Chen Doudou's father

00:13:19.659 --> 00:13:20.460
to pick up the child

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.759
make him leave immediately and call the police

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.320
You should go now

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:23.259
No, Teacher

00:13:23.259 --> 00:13:24.440
why would I pretend?

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:26.620
I really am Chen Doudou's biological dad

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.740
Then why haven't I seen you before?

00:13:28.779 --> 00:13:30.679
It's not... because of my work...

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.039
Anyway, I am his real dad

00:13:32.419 --> 00:13:33.600
Really the biological dad, right?

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.320
Yes, I am

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:35.740
Then you're exactly the one we're stopping

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.039
Doudou's mom said

00:13:37.039 --> 00:13:38.399
that you took out online loans

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.340
and you want to take the child

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:40.919
to sell to a fraud gang to pay off debts

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:41.820
What?

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:42.940
She... how could she...

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:43.399
Hey

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:44.320
What are you doing?

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:44.840
I...

00:13:47.299 --> 00:13:48.200
That Hu Xiaoli

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.659
she really knows how to spout nonsense

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:51.820
Um

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:55.000
Doudou's mom said you also have violent tendencies

00:13:55.759 --> 00:13:56.340
I...

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:57.460
I...

00:13:59.100 --> 00:13:59.860
Young man

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:03.039
The key issue of this rodent control problem

00:14:03.659 --> 00:14:05.899
is to implement the key issue

00:14:06.759 --> 00:14:07.519
So

00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:08.980
what is the key issue?

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:11.779
I want to test you

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.320
You tell me

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:14.840
I'll tell you

00:14:15.779 --> 00:14:17.039
How would I know?

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:18.740
You...

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.759
Where's that fat guy from just now?

00:14:20.919 --> 00:14:21.399
Uh

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.240
Stop thinking about that fat guy

00:14:23.259 --> 00:14:24.480
The leader is speaking here

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:26.379
Now, the key to the key issue

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:27.320
Right

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:28.600
So I want to test you

00:14:29.179 --> 00:14:30.899
So, the key to the key issue

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:31.740
what is it?

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:34.120
Let me tell you

00:14:35.139 --> 00:14:37.019
Are you luring the rat out of the mountain?

00:14:37.419 --> 00:14:38.500
Luring the tiger out of the mountain

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:39.159
Luring...

00:14:41.179 --> 00:14:41.840
Don't...

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:42.740
Don't...

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.580
Teacher, look at me seriously

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:47.100
Do I look like someone who knows a fraud gang?

00:14:48.559 --> 00:14:49.879
How could I tell that?

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:51.779
Where is he?

00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.360
Hey young man, you...

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:55.740
Come here

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.019
Are you guys in cahoots?

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:01.879
Come here, come back

00:15:01.879 --> 00:15:02.860
Is this your accomplice?

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.379
Yes

00:15:03.399 --> 00:15:04.220
What accomplice?

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.519
That's my mom

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.200
What about your mom?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:15.919
Dabao

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:20.740
The elderly don't know the law, but don't you know?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.460
Can you just steal a child back?

00:15:25.159 --> 00:15:27.220
If I hadn't gone to the police station to explain

00:15:27.779 --> 00:15:29.759
who knows how long the three of you would be detained

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:32.899
My dear Auntie Cai

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:34.820
my good Auntie Cai

00:15:35.899 --> 00:15:37.580
how could you be so reckless?

00:15:38.399 --> 00:15:39.940
We are all family, you...

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:41.519
talk about family affection

00:15:41.519 --> 00:15:42.720
talk some sense

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:44.440
Talk sense?

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:47.179
You haven't seen that mother and daughter pair

00:15:47.559 --> 00:15:48.460
Chen Dapang

00:15:48.899 --> 00:15:51.399
You think I can't find you if you hide here?

00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:53.039
Snatching the child

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:54.879
Auntie, watch me kill you...

00:15:54.879 --> 00:15:55.860
Hu Xiaoli, don't

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.320
You dare to cause a scene here?

00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:58.120
Watch me...

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:58.460
I...

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.139
I'm dodging

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:05.539
See that?

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:07.759
Bullying my son right in front of my face like that.

00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:08.879
You stop right there!

00:16:08.879 --> 00:16:10.299
Stop right there, Old Cai!

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:13.720
Are you going to handle your son abusing Xiaoli?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.879
Who's abusing whom?

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.740
Everyone here saw it.

00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:19.259
Xiao Sun, you...

00:16:19.279 --> 00:16:20.779
You're twisting the facts.

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:23.000
My daughter acted in self-defense.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:24.320
Ma'am...

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.019
Self-defense means...

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.139
during the process of him committing domestic violence...

00:16:28.139 --> 00:16:29.279
reasonable resistance is carried out.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:30.440
Listen to that. Only then...

00:16:31.379 --> 00:16:32.080
He said it.

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:34.159
He was committing domestic violence against her.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.940
I was stating the legal definition.

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.179
Not the factual basis.

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.320
That's enough.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:38.879
How about this...

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:41.320
Let me talk to this big sister.

00:16:41.519 --> 00:16:42.120
Step aside.

00:16:42.539 --> 00:16:43.440
Who are you calling "big sister"?

00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:45.639
A bunch of people with one foot in the grave,

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:47.620
idling away in a nursing home waiting to die.

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:48.679
And you're acting young with me?

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:50.379
This...

00:16:50.379 --> 00:16:50.799
Ma'am...

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:52.100
You can't say things like that.

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:52.519
That's right.

00:16:52.519 --> 00:16:54.120
The elders come to our nursing home...

00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:55.940
to receive better care.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:57.019
Professional care.

00:16:57.019 --> 00:16:57.440
Wha—

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.000
What do you mean "waiting to die"?

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.820
Our nursing institution's mission is...

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:01.340
To make money.

00:17:01.399 --> 00:17:01.820
That's right.

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:02.759
No, wait.

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.079
It's to serve the elderly.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.259
Then why do you charge money?

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.119
That covers our reasonable operating costs.

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.640
Isn't that still just to take money?

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:11.900
Uh, Sis—

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.160
Big sister...

00:17:13.279 --> 00:17:14.839
Our Willow New Town here...

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:16.019
really doesn't charge much.

00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:19.799
Some people really do help count the cash after being sold.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:20.859
Forget it.

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.039
Alright, I don't want to waste my breath on you...

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:23.680
...bunch of old folks.

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:24.920
As for me...

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:26.579
I'm going home.

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:29.079
To reunite with my grandson.

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:32.299
Wait, Xiao Sun...

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:33.019
Auntie Cai.

00:17:35.779 --> 00:17:36.440
See that?

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:37.859
That piece of work.

00:17:38.299 --> 00:17:40.299
She was my best sister back then.

00:17:40.579 --> 00:17:42.420
In today's words, a bestie.

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:42.920
Right?

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.279
Dabao and Little Fox's childhood betrothal...

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:47.940
was arranged by me.

00:17:48.519 --> 00:17:51.440
The key is, I didn't expect to be blinded by a fledgling.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.559
I was wrong.

00:17:54.779 --> 00:17:55.960
So you mean...

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.059
our Willow New Town...

00:17:57.279 --> 00:17:58.359
won't be charging fees then?

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.440
What I mean is...

00:18:00.019 --> 00:18:01.359
persuading Dabao not to divorce.

00:18:02.019 --> 00:18:02.640
I was wrong.

00:18:03.619 --> 00:18:04.299
Auntie Cai.

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.339
I support you.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:07.859
This marriage...

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:09.839
must end.

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.880
Then my big grandson...

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:12.519
Don't worry.

00:18:13.259 --> 00:18:15.160
Major law firms are full of my alumni.

00:18:15.619 --> 00:18:16.960
We'll use the weapon of the law...

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.420
to snatch back your grandson.

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:19.539
Right.

00:18:19.539 --> 00:18:20.559
I'll go out and check again.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.819
I'll try to goad the couple into another fight.

00:18:23.759 --> 00:18:24.900
Don't do that.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.220
My son can't beat that Little Fox.

00:18:28.019 --> 00:18:30.420
If you can't live together, you have to divorce.

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.500
Enduring, dragging, stalling, suffering, stewing...

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.339
Making do...

00:18:34.339 --> 00:18:35.519
is bad for everyone.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.559
Look at me, Uncle Liang, back then...

00:18:37.559 --> 00:18:38.559
when I first got divorced.

00:18:38.579 --> 00:18:40.539
It really felt awful inside.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.339
I felt uncomfortable all over.

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:43.779
But look at me now.

00:18:44.259 --> 00:18:44.980
I'm relaxed.

00:18:45.599 --> 00:18:46.880
I'm totally relaxed.

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:48.420
How relaxed am I!

00:18:48.619 --> 00:18:49.759
I'm free.

00:18:51.059 --> 00:18:53.440
I get up whenever I want.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.740
After getting up, I just don't fold the quilt.

00:18:56.339 --> 00:18:58.000
Dirty clothes and smelly socks thrown on the bed.

00:18:58.359 --> 00:18:59.240
One shoe, hey...

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.259
lying under the bed for over half a month.

00:19:00.259 --> 00:19:01.759
I just won't fish it out.

00:19:01.759 --> 00:19:02.519
So what?

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.839
Who dares to control me?

00:19:03.859 --> 00:19:04.680
That's true.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:06.000
Who could possibly control you?

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:07.819
After eating...

00:19:07.819 --> 00:19:09.799
pots and pans pile up in the sink for a week.

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:11.640
The trash in the wastebasket...

00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.619
has piled up into a mountain.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:14.900
I just won't move it.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.400
It will never disappear.

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.759
When I go out, the house is a mess.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:20.640
A total disaster.

00:19:21.079 --> 00:19:22.079
After coming back a month later...

00:19:22.079 --> 00:19:22.799
Guess what?

00:19:22.799 --> 00:19:23.339
What?

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:25.400
It's still a total disaster.

00:19:27.059 --> 00:19:29.700
You really can't do without someone in the house.

00:19:31.759 --> 00:19:32.240
No,

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:34.380
I'm saying I'm happy about this.

00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:36.119
Uncle Liang, is this really happiness?

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:38.759
No, I... I'm free now!

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:41.359
Life is precious,

00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.259
but freedom is worth more.

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.380
It's just that my ex-wife...

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.220
Not only was her cooking bad,

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:50.759
the main thing was she nagged too much.

00:19:51.079 --> 00:19:52.720
Her standards were too high.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:54.539
Every day she had to make me

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.380
two meat dishes, two veggie dishes, and a soup.

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.779
Staples were noodles, rice,

00:19:58.779 --> 00:20:01.460
steamed buns, stuffed buns, meat pies, pancakes,

00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:02.519
dumplings, potstickers...

00:20:02.519 --> 00:20:03.759
She never repeated a dish.

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.200
How annoying is that?

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.799
Look how good I have it now.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.599
Whatever flavor I want to eat,

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:09.859
that's the flavor I eat...

00:20:10.859 --> 00:20:11.880
of instant noodles.

00:20:13.559 --> 00:20:14.859
You only eat instant noodles?

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.980
Sometimes I add a ham sausage.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.160
Dabao,

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.720
back then, Uncle Liang was just like you.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:22.259
I was a hands-off husband too.

00:20:22.819 --> 00:20:24.400
When you go to pick up the kid at kindergarten,

00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.160
the teacher

00:20:25.339 --> 00:20:26.259
doesn't recognize you, right?

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.200
She didn't let you pick them up.

00:20:27.579 --> 00:20:28.859
I was even worse than you.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.640
Once, when I went to pick up my daughter Jingjing,

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:33.619
I actually brought home someone else's kid.

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.759
Wouldn't you say the wife would be mad?

00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:38.339
No, if you're mad,

00:20:38.339 --> 00:20:39.380
just talk to me properly.

00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.920
I'll change and that's it.

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:41.599
Right?

00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:42.980
But she insisted on arguing with me.

00:20:43.019 --> 00:20:44.200
And it wasn't just her arguing.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.960
She mobilized her whole family to join in.

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.180
Her dad, mom, uncle, aunt,

00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.859
and that wretched brother of hers.

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.420
Isn't this just a gang beating?

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.519
Could I tolerate that?

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:54.319
If I tolerated that,

00:20:54.319 --> 00:20:55.859
what would happen to my status in the family?

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:58.359
Even though I wanted to be nicer to her in my heart,

00:20:58.859 --> 00:21:00.819
I was already pushed to that point.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:03.220
I had to fight her.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.480
Fight to the bitter end.

00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.940
Who told you not to discuss it nicely with me?

00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.099
If you have something to say, say it nicely.

00:21:12.319 --> 00:21:13.460
Since you made such a scene,

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:14.740
we must divorce.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.660
We have to divorce.

00:21:15.819 --> 00:21:16.799
Who's afraid of whom?

00:21:20.220 --> 00:21:21.299
Right.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.500
Xiao Cai,

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:23.519
don't you worry.

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:26.259
This time, I took all my years of divorce,

00:21:26.319 --> 00:21:28.400
the experience from both positive and negative sides,

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.480
and explained it thoroughly to the kids.

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:32.000
It definitely won't work out.

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.440
You guys...

00:21:37.099 --> 00:21:38.539
What's the situation?

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:39.619
Mom,

00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:40.680
Dabao and I

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.779
have already made up.

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.099
We're going home now.

00:21:43.259 --> 00:21:44.619
How could you make...

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:45.759
up?

00:21:45.819 --> 00:21:46.759
Made up... good.

00:21:46.819 --> 00:21:48.460
It's good that you made up.

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:51.440
Thanks to Uncle Liang's strong advice.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.460
You have to help the two of us

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.839
thank him properly.

00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:01.339
I swear to God!

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:03.579
I just shared my own divorce experience

00:22:03.579 --> 00:22:05.200
with the two of them.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.359
I didn't try to get them back together at all.

00:22:07.359 --> 00:22:08.319
You still won't admit it.

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:09.619
You were the one blindly meddling.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:10.940
It really wasn't me blindly...

00:22:11.839 --> 00:22:12.859
I don't mean to lecture you,

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.880
but it was you two mothers who blindly meddled.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.480
The young couple was just bickering,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.119
showing a bit of temper.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.519
It's just a lovers' spat that resolves itself.

00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.039
But you two, on the other hand...

00:22:22.099 --> 00:22:23.200
I don't mean to lecture you,

00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:24.960
and you call yourselves besties.

00:22:25.119 --> 00:22:26.660
You just protect your own kids and take sides,

00:22:26.759 --> 00:22:27.920
blowing things out of proportion.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:28.900
I don't mean to lecture you, I...

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.740
Haven't you lectured me enough already?

00:22:31.119 --> 00:22:32.140
Grandpa Liang is right.

00:22:32.900 --> 00:22:34.079
I didn't play a helpful role either.

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:35.400
I should reflect on that.

00:22:36.819 --> 00:22:38.500
A married couple is like a pair of binary stars,

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.819
attracting and repelling each other,

00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:42.099
maintaining a dynamic equilibrium.

00:22:42.319 --> 00:22:43.859
Once the older generation gets involved,

00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:45.579
it breaks their original orbit.

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.619
Their movement

00:22:46.839 --> 00:22:48.000
becomes chaotic and

00:22:48.180 --> 00:22:49.119
impossible to monitor.

00:22:49.579 --> 00:22:51.140
It's just like the three-body problem.

00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:51.859
What?

00:22:51.859 --> 00:22:52.619
What body?

00:22:52.619 --> 00:22:53.480
The Three-Body Problem.

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:55.279
Liu Cixin's sci-fi novel.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:56.640
It's super popular, let me tell you.

00:22:56.759 --> 00:22:57.559
I know it.

00:22:57.799 --> 00:22:58.980
Isn't it the one where

00:23:00.019 --> 00:23:01.359
the sun is about to explode,

00:23:01.559 --> 00:23:03.220
and they have to take us Earthlings to...

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:05.400
Taurus or Pegasus or something?

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:06.619
Centaurus.

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:08.700
What you're talking about is "The Wandering Earth".

00:23:08.779 --> 00:23:09.900
It's all about the same, right?

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:13.019
Director Chang, you too,

00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.259
you've always supported my divorce.

00:23:15.339 --> 00:23:16.599
Why have you changed your tune now?

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.140
That's why I said I need to reflect.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.160
As soon as your in-laws came over

00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:21.559
and questioned my management philosophy,

00:23:21.819 --> 00:23:22.660
I got impulsive too.

00:23:23.839 --> 00:23:24.539
Auntie Cai,

00:23:25.259 --> 00:23:26.980
matters between young people

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:29.160
shouldn't be interfered with by the older generation.

00:23:29.579 --> 00:23:30.940
And certainly shouldn't be meddled in.

00:23:31.599 --> 00:23:32.859
So you mean

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.059
that I...

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.720
watching my son get bullied,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:37.319
should just stand by and stare helplessly?

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.599
Yes, Auntie Cai.

00:23:39.079 --> 00:23:41.220
We've prepared a surprise for you.

00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:42.579
What surprise?

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.059
We decided to present you with a...

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:53.240
This is a surprise, huh?

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.500
You're doing this on purpose to piss me off, right?

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.019
Staring Contest?

00:23:57.079 --> 00:23:58.380
I will absolutely not accept it!

00:23:58.579 --> 00:24:00.400
I will fight them to the end!
