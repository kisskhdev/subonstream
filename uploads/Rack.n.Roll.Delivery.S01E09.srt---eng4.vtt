WEBVTT

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.439
I lost.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:11.400
You useless trash.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.239
So what if you won?

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.400
Your Long Weiwei is never coming back.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.359
What exactly happened back then?

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.560
Back then...

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.000
It was all because of you back then.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:23.079
Because of your obsession.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:23.879
You got her killed.

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:25.359
You are the real murderer.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.079
Speak!

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.400
Explain it clearly to me!

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.120
What exactly happened back then?

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:33.000
Do you know what those few...

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.040
...what those few phone calls meant?

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.280
You'll never know.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.280
You will never find out.

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.000
You are the real murderer.

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:54.480
Trust me.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.599
It wasn't your fault.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.040
I will help you find the truth.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.840
And avenge her.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.960
You ungrateful traitor.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.039
That match cost me half my safe.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.599
And you dared to cancel the deal on your own?

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.599
Boss Nan.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.400
Boss Nan!

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:22.840
Boss Nan...

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:24.759
I'm innocent, Boss Nan!

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.159
By the time I found out...

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.120
...the ship had already turned around.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.879
I didn't know anything, Boss Nan!

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.919
Open your damn eyes...

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:33.800
...and look closely!

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:36.199
Boss Nan...

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.439
I... I really didn't send it.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.680
Boss Nan, believe me.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.080
Boss Nan!

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.199
I really didn't send it!

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.360
Boss Nan!

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.599
Something happened!

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.520
The police raided the cruise ship in the East Sea.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.000
And those girls were released.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.800
Idiot!

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.840
Boss Nan...

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:55.000
Boss Nan!

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.840
Boss Nan!

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.039
You have quite the appetite.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:01.919
So eager to replace me.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.800
Boss Nan...

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:04.000
It's...

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:07.039
It's...

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.960
It's you!

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.879
You framed me!

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.199
I framed you?

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.120
Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.080
I knew you were plotting against me.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.439
I installed backup software on your phone.

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.919
It must be you!

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.400
The pool hall raid...

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.159
...was your doing too!

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.639
You witch!

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.039
Witch!

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.120
Boss Nan!

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:31.400
Boss Nan!

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:32.840
I didn't send the message!

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.319
I didn't send the message!

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.599
Yesterday on the dance floor...

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.560
...someone stole my phone on the dance floor!

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.800
Someone must have stolen my phone and sent it!

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.280
Still struggling in vain?

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.280
The dance floor was full of your people.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.919
What?

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.680
Want to add another charge to your list?

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.080
You really are an ungrateful backstabber.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.280
Such a big business like Nine Heavens Media...

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.080
...I handed it to you.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.840
And you're still not satisfied.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.360
Get out of my sight.

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.319
Drag him out and let him reflect on this.

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.599
Yes, sir.

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.639
Boss Nan!

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.240
I really didn't do it!

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:04.120
Boss Nan!

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.800
Boss Nan!

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.520
Luckily, the cruise ship incident...

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.719
...didn't affect Liheng.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:12.560
From now on, the business of Nine Heavens Media...

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.719
...will be handled by you.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.840
Things have been unstable lately.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.199
Keep a close eye on the people below.

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:22.120
Don't worry, Boss Nan.

00:04:23.519 --> 00:04:24.680
Go bring Hei Ba here too.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.480
It's time I met him.

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:40.639
Jiuye.

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:43.639
Why aren't you taking me to Kaye Mountain today?

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.079
Are you in a bad mood?

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.160
It's okay.

00:04:56.319 --> 00:04:58.279
You'll feel better in a moment.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.720
What beautiful earrings.

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.079
Are these for me?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360
You like them?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.800
As long as you make me happy tonight,

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.319
they're yours.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:43.240
Hei Ba.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.879
I didn't expect to see you again.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:52.759
Triple Crown Champion.

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.800
Don't take the championship this time.

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.680
It's good to let someone else win.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:03.000
I knew I didn't misjudge you.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.279
Greedy people...

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.439
are the ones we can work best with.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.439
The champion...

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:19.000
he doesn't deserve it.

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:20.680
And neither do you.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.399
Boss Nan.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:28.360
You're just letting him go?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.720
Since he refused to lose gracefully,

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:33.040
then let him taste...

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.519
the taste of humiliation.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.480
You don't remember me, do you?

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.839
What do you want with me?

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.279
In this cruise ship tournament,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.079
you really stole the show.

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:57.079
Those rich bosses all have their eyes on you.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.000
They asked me to discuss a big deal with you.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:03.160
As long as you play how I tell you,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.160
we can make a lot of money.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:08.120
Here's to a happy partnership.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:09.759
Let me toast you.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.920
I didn't expect that after all these years,

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.959
you'd still be this stubborn.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.279
Mr. Jiang loves buying people's loyalty.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:26.720
But have you forgotten?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.240
My heart...

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.199
cannot be bought.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.120
I advise you not to refuse me again.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.439
Because the price...

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.720
is one you can't afford.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.079
Take a good look at this face.

00:07:47.439 --> 00:07:49.519
Doesn't she look like your dead girlfriend?

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:00.160
Such a temper.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.199
I like working with people like you...

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.959
who value love and loyalty.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.240
Don't be in a hurry to refuse my offer.

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:09.879
Tonight, I'll let you two...

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.560
relive your old romance.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.240
What are you doing?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.720
Do we have to do this?

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.480
In Jiang Nanshuo's eyes,

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.600
money is always more important than women.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.960
I must seize this opportunity...

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:04.679
to gain Jiang Nanshuo's trust.

00:09:05.519 --> 00:09:06.000
So,

00:09:06.759 --> 00:09:07.559
play along with me for one night.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.120
You saw it today, too.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.200
Those girls on the ship were nearly sold.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.879
Nine Heavens Media...

00:09:15.879 --> 00:09:17.600
surely has more dirty secrets.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:19.840
After tonight,

00:09:20.759 --> 00:09:22.240
I'll be able to take over Nine Heavens Media.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.759
I can only tell you this:

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.320
I am not like Jiang Nanshuo.

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.480
You can trust me on that.

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:31.960
So tonight,

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.159
I need you...

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:45.440
to hold me tight.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:05.399
There's something wrong with this mirror.

00:10:21.039 --> 00:10:21.919
Are you ready?
