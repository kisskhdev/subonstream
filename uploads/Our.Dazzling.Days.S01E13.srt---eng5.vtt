[Our Dazzling Days]

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.670
[Episode 13]

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.490
You're back.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.690
Why are you smiling?

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:57.400
I'm reading.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.530
"High-Frequency Electronic Circuits."

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.050
Is there a joke in that book?

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.260
No, no.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.530
I was smiling because
you're dressed a bit funny.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.320
What's wrong?

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.560
In a bad mood?

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.030
You look ready to blow at any second.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.890
What happened?

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.079
I just went to
a hometown association gathering.

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:22.240
Someone there said

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.240
we from the East Chemical Plant
don't count as Tiecheng locals.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.440
Just because of that?

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.430
If you ask me,
you shouldn't have gone at all.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.490
A guy from our plant

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.180
who was a few grades above me

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.360
once told me that back in their day,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.520
when they went to
hometown association gatherings,

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.320
people didn't even treat him
like one of their own.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.120
In their eyes,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.700
our Third Front Plant area

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.329
is its own separate world.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.240
They invited me to one
a couple of days ago.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.079
But I thought,

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.840
why would I go? To get bullied?

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.560
But we did grow up there.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.810
If not there, then where are we from?

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.380
We are children of the Third Front.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.520
They look down on us?

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.080
Guess what—
we don't think much of them either.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.810
If you ask me,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.430
we should start our own Third Front Plant
hometown association gatherings,

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.680
and you should be the president.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.610
That's what I call
true brotherhood across the land.

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.400
Xiaodan, come out with me for a moment.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.040
Senior Chen.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.430
I know what you want to say.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.750
But I want to tell you

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.960
that I already have a boyfriend.
His name is Zhang Xiaoman.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.990
He's my childhood friend,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:52.079
and we're really close.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.470
Even though we're long-distance now,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.070
our relationship is stable.

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:55.710
We aren't breaking up,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:56.870
nor do we plan to.

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.800
I'll still be with him in the future,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.870
and he's the only one I want to be with.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.530
I won't consider anyone else.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.970
And of course, there's no one else there
for me to consider.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.280
If I said or did anything before

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.110
that made you get the wrong idea,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.390
I'm sorry.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.310
Xiaodan.

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.510
Your parents and mine

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.730
did think about setting us up,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.870
and I admit that I have feelings for you.

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.230
But please don't be nervous.

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.600
Xiaodan, you're
a wonderful younger sister.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.040
And my feelings for you

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.720
are just that—feelings.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.650
That's good. That's good.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.480
With all this back and forth,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.130
it almost sounds like you rejected me.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.470
I feel relieved
now that we've cleared the air.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.470
Xiaodan.

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.430
We haven't even started yet,

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.070
so there's no "rejection" here.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.870
Right, right.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.630
So go back to your reading.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:04.800
I'm off to class.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.240
Bye-bye.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.870
Bye-bye.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.560
Too small again?

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.190
Off by 0.66cm.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:24.850
Close enough. 0.66cm is fine.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.630
We haven't been practicing that long.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.480
Especially that this thing

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.510
keeps buzzing like crazy—

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.460
feels just like being in an English class.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.920
It's giving me a headache.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.120
-It's not fine.
-Let's have a rest and drink some water.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.720
This is your livelihood.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.380
You have to learn it properly.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.250
Stop talking nonsense all day.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.010
You know the labor benefits
in our plant?

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.560
In summer, it's tea;

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.480
and in winter, it's sugar water.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.940
But for us, it's just plain boiled water.

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.000
So astringent and tasteless.

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:56.310
You know what?

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.360
Be grateful you have anything to drink.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.360
I had to boil this water myself.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.820
Otherwise, you wouldn't even have this.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.070
I've thought about it.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:08.160
When I officially join our plant,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.960
I won't necessarily do this job.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.510
If I can't handle this, I'll go to
the Maintenance Workshop instead.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:14.120
This stuff...

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.950
Maintenance is much simpler than this.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.360
I have a talent for that, you know?

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.930
Take our alarm clock for example.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.710
I can take it apart
and put it back together.

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.640
E-Even with this thing,

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.750
I can take it apart

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:28.190
and reassemble it with my eyes closed.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.920
Give me a break.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.680
You'll only end up with spare parts
all over the floor.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:31.600
I mean it. Rest assured.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.360
Don't mess around.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.070
Let me show you.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.200
Just have your rest.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.510
Don't mess with my machine.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.159
It's fine.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.480
You know what?

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.000
I heard an expert is coming today

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.560
to give us some pointers.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.800
You'd better listen carefully.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.830
What expert?

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:47.190
You're asking for a kicking
messing around here,

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:47.870
I'm telling you.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:48.360
You...

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:52.290
Mr. Zhuang.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.860
So you're the expert he talked about?

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.110
What the hell did you lathe?

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.720
Do you have no hands,

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.440
no eyes,

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:11.530
or no brain?

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:16.730
Mr. Zhuang, I-I've only been learning this
for a few days.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.120
Is this what you learned?

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:21.240
The work uniform
has three tightness requirements.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:21.640
Right.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.250
Tight collar, tight cuffs,

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.160
and tight hem.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.600
If you get dragged into the machine,

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.460
it'll be too late for regrets.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:35.850
Mr. Zhuang.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.600
Xiaoman.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.780
It's off by 0.66cm.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.020
Mr. Zhuang.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.510
You could tell it's off by 0.66cm

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:48.680
without even using a caliper?

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.920
My eyes are my ruler.

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.190
Thousands upon thousands of these

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.850
have passed through my hands.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.159
As expected from you, Mr. Zhuang.

00:07:56.159 --> 00:07:59.360
Being a Grade 8 turner is no joke.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.710
You've got real skills.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.680
It's a shame.
Though I've got all my skills,

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:07.280
that little brat of mine

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.000
took off running the very first day

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.530
he put on his work uniform,

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.920
like he was being tortured.

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.720
Why didn't you guys stop him?

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:16.170
Mr. Zhuang.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:17.800
Zhuang Sen

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.800
has his own dreams and pursuits, right?

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:22.830
It's okay. We are still here.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:24.170
We'll carry on

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.360
this legacy for you.

00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:25.800
Don't worry.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.000
Carry on what legacy?

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.240
I'm not dead yet.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.510
Alright, alright.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:30.720
If you want to learn,

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.680
I'll teach you.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:34.169
You've got to carry it forward

00:08:34.549 --> 00:08:35.280
and show them

00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:38.010
that East Chemical
has a new generation ready to take over.

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:39.559
For sure, Mr. Zhuang. Don't worry.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.559
We'll learn well.

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:44.440
Mr. Ding,

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:46.720
aren't you going to count
the bonus I just gave you?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.270
Count it?

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:49.000
Would you dare shortchange me?

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.110
You've got some nerve, Zhao.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:52.490
By the way, Mr. Ding.

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.210
Our plant

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.170
has announced

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.200
a new financial regulation.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.240
Basically, for healthy adults

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.320
without illnesses or injuries,

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:02.790
from now on, no subsidies will be given.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.030
Xiaoman

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.210
turned 18 6 months ago,

00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.960
so he's considered an adult now.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.360
Tell him that from now on,

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.080
he won't be receiving
that 100 yuan anymore.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.070
He won't be receiving it?

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.020
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:20.320
Our plant won't take care of
its own children anymore?

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.750
It's not that
we're not taking care of them.

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.960
Meals in our cafeteria

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:23.920
are still free;

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:26.200
and if they have any
minor illness or injury,

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.200
our plant hospital still covers it.

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:30.510
It's just the 100 yuan pocket money
that's stopping.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.600
What kind of nonsense is that?

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.730
Xiaoman hasn't received a salary yet.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.790
There are tens of thousands of people
in our plant.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.390
Are you short of his 100 yuan?

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:39.960
Mr. Ding, you can't put it that way.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.360
There has to be an end to subsidies.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:44.720
If Xiaoman never works,

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.000
is our plant supposed to

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.930
provide his pocket money for life?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.570
Tell you what, Zhao.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.000
As for Xiaoman's monthly 100 yuan subsidy,

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.040
I'll cover it.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.130
You'll cover it?

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.600
Then how am I supposed to
do the accounting for this sum?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.600
What do you mean?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.350
Forget the accounts.

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:05.000
Just keep it to yourself.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.510
Don't tell anyone about it.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:07.390
If Xiaoman ever asks you,

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:09.630
just tell him
you've given the money to me.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.890
The kid is too pitiful.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.090
Okay.

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.960
I know what to do, Mr. Ding.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.790
If you ask me,

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.000
you're not treating Xiaoman like a godson,

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.570
more like your own son.

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.360
You scared me.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.620
You didn't even knock.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.910
Well, you didn't lock the door.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.410
You scared me.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.410
The door was open.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.750
What did Xiaodan send you?
It smells so good.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:58.750
Let me have a look.

00:10:59.150 --> 00:10:59.790
You smelled it?

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:00.450
Yeah, I did.

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.810
You've got a sharp nose.

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.260
Take a look.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.660
Why does it smell so good?

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.320
I want to get one for Lulu too.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.450
Where did you get it?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.240
It's the scent of osmanthus.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.440
Bet you didn't know that.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.000
We don't seem to have that stuff
around here.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.360
In Shanghai, the streets are lined with
osmanthus trees.

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:26.790
When the season comes and they bloom,

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.450
the whole street smells like this.
It's lovely.

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.450
They are all over the streets?

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.160
So Xiaodan just picked some up
and sent them to you?

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.360
Can't you talk properly?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.470
If not, just go home.

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:40.070
Just kidding. Just kidding.

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:43.350
What are you here for?

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.020
You spent the whole afternoon

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.020
just...

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.510
Just welding this thing?

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.360
No. There's also this.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.420
There's also this.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.150
This... A kitchen knife?

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.020
It's a bit crooked.

00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.440
But if this is meant to be
a slicing knife,

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.370
it's a bit short.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.450
It's a toothbrush made for you.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.060
What's wrong with your eyes? This...

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.820
This is a sailboat, okay?

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:17.450
A sailboat.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.490
Oh, it's a sailboat?

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:24.670
It looks a bit like one. It does.

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.750
So it's a sailboat.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.150
What do you mean "a bit like one"?

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:28.480
It is a sailboat.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.960
But look.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.240
Isn't it just a locomotive,

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:34.360
with a front part added,

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:35.820
and then this thing on top?

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:38.790
Now that you said it,
this half does look like a locomotive.

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:39.790
But you should indeed

00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:42.600
send this thing to Xiaodan

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:44.480
and let Xiaodan

00:12:44.510 --> 00:12:46.000
analyze it for you

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:47.810
with her artistic eye.

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.050
Can't you just buy one?

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.240
Why?

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.900
It's the thought that counts.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.320
If you just buy one on the street,

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:57.030
what's the point?

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.320
I made this myself.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.360
Good or bad,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:03.000
I put my heart, time, and energy

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.150
into this.

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.480
I-Isn't that much better than buying one?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.290
Besides, if I buy it...

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.280
I have to save my money
for travel expenses to Shanghai, you know.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.960
But if you give her this,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.240
Xiaodan will think

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.170
we're learning from a PE coach.

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.350
Cut the crap. Come on.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.090
Polish the sail. Make it shine.

00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:24.750
Why polish it?

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.790
Just go find Mr. Zhuang.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.300
You've got an expert right there.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.320
What for?

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:35.000
To make this thing.
It'd be great if he taught you.

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.990
I can't impose on him.

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.600
It's okay.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.790
Just buy him two bottles of wine.

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:43.910
Doesn't that cost money as well?

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:45.600
How much can wine cost?

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.740
Hurry up. Go to your house

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.000
and bring two bottles.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.960
From my brother?

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:50.960
Don't bring that many.

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.360
J-Just bring one bottle.

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.080
Wait for me at the unit door.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:54.910
Hurry, hurry.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.610
Be quick.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.750
Don't bring anything too expensive,

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.750
or your brother will beat you up.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.480
Don't worry.

00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:31.510
Excuse me.

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.080
You can't just throw away scrap like that.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.010
There's a trash can right up ahead.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.080
Ma'am, this isn't trash.

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.390
My boyfriend gave this to me.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.310
It's a boat.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.480
It's a boat. Look.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.090
Oh, a boat...

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:49.080
It's a boat.

00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.200
It looks quite expensive.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.030
I really don't understand
young people these days.

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:57.160
It was thoughtful of him to make a boat.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.750
I'm going to an exhibition later,

00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.350
so I won't be home for dinner.

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.490
Why are you going out again?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.120
You won't be home for dinner
again, Sweetie?

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:11.120
If I want to have a meal with you
in the future,

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.720
do I have to submit a report first
or something?

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.670
Of course you don't need a report
to eat with me.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:27.750
I'm the one who has to report to you.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:31.080
Well, I have a request.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.370
I want to go back to
East Chemical Plant for winter break.

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:35.120
Denied.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.480
Why?

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:40.620
It's your first year back in Shanghai,
you know?

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:42.680
Your mom has so many relatives here.

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.680
You... You have to visit them then.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.720
They're all looking forward to seeing you.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.270
I haven't seen anyone from our plant
for 6 months.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:52.580
Yan, talk nicely.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.600
Sweetie, you just got to Shanghai.

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:59.550
You need to make some friends here.

00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:00.910
You also need to fit in here in Shanghai,

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:01.320
right?

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:02.640
Besides,

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.870
try to be understanding of your father.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:07.080
He's been away for so many years.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:09.550
He needs to reconnect

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.240
with his old friends here.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.370
What does that have to do with me?

00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:14.770
He can just go by himself.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:21.840
How can he go by himself?

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.750
Those relatives and friends of ours
are all coming to see you.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.080
For your sake, you know?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.870
Besides, families are supposed to

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.960
spend the holidays together.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.910
We can't spend them apart, right?

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:33.240
You are usually so busy.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.220
You've got to spend some more time

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.240
with your father and me
during the holidays,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:36.750
right?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:44.480
Then I want to go back to
East Chemical Plant for summer break.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:45.120
Okay.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.630
I can't be bothered with you.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:48.360
Okay, go back for summer break.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.270
I promise you.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:51.630
You can go back for summer break.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:52.300
Does this look pretty?

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:53.360
Yeah, it's pretty.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:59.220
The food in Shanghai must be good.

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:00.680
You've put on some weight.

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.550
How was it? Did you miss us?

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:04.550
I haven't gained any weight.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:05.109
Of course—

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:06.310
of course I missed you guys.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.710
Seeing you guys
makes me feel like I'm home.

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.130
Not bad, Xia Lei.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.750
Your accent hasn't changed.

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.680
I thought coming back from Shanghai,

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.960
you'd be speaking all la-di-da.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.960
It's "Ala, ala."

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.400
What la-di-da?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.960
What the hell is "la-di-da"?

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.460
Xiaodan is the one who speaks like that.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.190
She's got that Shanghai blood.

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:28.050
Why do you have to bring up
something so sensitive?

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:29.510
You started it,

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.510
with your "la-di-da."

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:31.680
Well, anyway,

00:17:31.830 --> 00:17:33.310
although Xiaodan isn't coming back
this year,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.370
she'll definitely be back next year.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:37.480
As long as East Chemical Plant stands,

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.660
we won't scatter, right?

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.460
-Right, we won't scatter.
-Yes.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.480
I've talked to Xiaodan on the phone.

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.810
She's spending New Year's
with her family there this year.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:48.110
Well, it's fine if she doesn't come back,

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.110
but you have to come back.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:50.030
I won't accept it if you don't come back.

00:17:50.030 --> 00:17:52.240
E-Even if I do come back,
it won't be because of you.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.440
I'm coming back for my parents.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.550
Whatever the reason.

00:17:54.550 --> 00:17:56.240
You just have to come back.
You have to be here,

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:56.860
you know?

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:58.090
Alright, alright.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:01.920
I-I heard from my dad

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.550
that our plant isn't doing so well.

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.030
It's doing okay.

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.310
Look at my 100 yuan a month—

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.370
it's always been paid right on time.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:10.300
No delays at all.

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:12.670
That's pretty good then.

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:13.880
In my dorm,

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.880
there's another Third Front child.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.400
He said back in his hometown,

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.440
their plant is doing poorly.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:20.750
That's just them.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.310
You know, our plant is different.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.750
Our plant won't be like that.

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.030
Dongdong and I learn skills
at the technical school every day.

00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:29.030
We're going full steam,
ready to take up our posts anytime.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.110
We're just waiting for it.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:31.640
Good. That's good.

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.070
We're at Huiliu River.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:39.310
Are we entering the plant area?

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:40.680
Yeah, we're almost home.

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:43.680
What's the first thing you want to do
when you get home?

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.110
I want to take a bath.

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:48.310
Let's do it. No problem.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:49.150
We'll go take a bath right away.

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:49.630
Okay.

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:02.640
Put some strength into it.
I haven't had a good scrub in ages.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.440
Just trust my scrubbing skills.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:07.270
I'm almost a semi-pro scrubber.

00:19:09.010 --> 00:19:10.270
Look at all this grime.

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:13.240
You haven't had a scrub
in at least 6 months, have you?

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:15.030
Good for you.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.840
You've been soaking for a while.

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.550
Don't you feel dizzy?

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.200
It feels good.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:25.270
So good.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.260
You don't understand.

00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.990
When winter comes in Shanghai,

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.920
the cold wind chills you to the bone.

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.000
I just thought,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.030
if there were a hot bath pool,

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:37.960
I'd dive right in.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:42.440
Wait, doesn't Shanghai have bathhouses?

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.710
Well, the school doesn't.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:45.830
Just showers.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.510
The nights in Shanghai are unbearable.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.190
I'd sleep hugging a hot water bottle,

00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:54.450
but by the next morning, it'd be ice cold.

00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:56.670
Sometimes

00:19:57.050 --> 00:19:58.970
my legs would cramp and wake me up.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.030
Isn't that kind of ridiculous?

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.350
Is it that bad? It's the south, after all.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.510
It can't be even colder than here.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:06.110
It's different in the south.

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:08.180
Their cold is damp and penetrating.

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.070
Plus, there's no central heating
in the south.

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:12.070
It's not warm like it is here at home.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:15.970
That does sound like torture.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:18.550
Apart from the cold,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.610
what else is there?

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:20.880
In Shanghai?

00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.340
Well, Shanghai

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:32.920
is a very big city.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.830
It's huge—

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.030
too big for me to handle.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.770
It gives me a sort of...

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.080
A sort of loneliness.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:43.310
What?

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.080
Loneliness.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:46.720
You feel lonely?

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.480
Why would you feel lonely?
There are so many people in Shanghai.

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.680
How can you be lonely?

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.550
It's not about how many people there are.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.550
It's just that...

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:58.550
They are all strangers.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.440
The way they look at you, it's just...

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.350
It's like you're a... A bumpkin.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.840
What about school? Your classmates?

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.880
Don't they hang out with you?

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:11.480
Classmates... My classmates are fine.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.640
Everyone's busy with their own stuff.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.070
It's not like in our plant.

00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:16.200
We're so close here.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.480
It's different.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.650
I went to
a hometown association gathering once,

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.960
but I felt I couldn't fit in.

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:27.770
It felt like
I'm not really a Tiecheng local.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.720
They...

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:32.680
You know, when I'm out there,

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:34.790
I don't even know where I'm really from.

00:21:34.790 --> 00:21:37.640
Well, if you mean strictly Tiecheng,

00:21:37.790 --> 00:21:38.720
we don't count as locals.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.720
But our East Chemical Plant
is quite an important area.

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.580
They still won't hang out with us.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.350

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.850
It's fine if you want to pass.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.110
Why do you have to...

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:48.510
A two.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.070
Pass.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.970
Black Joker.

00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.720
Black Joker played.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:54.210
Black Joker played?
Then I'll play the Red Joker.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:54.880
-You go ahead.
-No card to play, huh?

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.280
You go ahead. Pass for me.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.350
A six.

00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.160
A nine.

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:00.050
A Jack.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.070
What kind of hand is this?

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.310
-Hey! What are you doing?
-B-Bomb it.

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:04.350
How can I bomb that?

00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:05.590
Bomb. Bomb that.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:06.480
Right, bomb that.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:07.350
Right, you can bomb it.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.680
-Wait, you...
-Four fours.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.270
Four fours? I'll bomb too. Four fives.

00:24:10.270 --> 00:24:11.680
What are you doing here?

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:13.440
I'm here to see my fellow townsman.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.000
Others might not consider you
their fellow townsman,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.510
but I do.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:15.510
Fellow townsman?

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:16.860
Aren't you from "Hujian"?

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:19.520
I heard you speaking fluent Fujianese
with Liu.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.720
Buddy, you are way off.

00:24:23.030 --> 00:24:24.110
It should be "Hugian."

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:25.420
-Hugian?
-Hugian.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.350
-Hugian.
-That's right.

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:27.590
Stop it, stop it.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.250
What do you want from me?

00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:30.350
You're interrupting our game.

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:31.680
Didn't people say you're odd?

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.960
I prepared a stylish outfit

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.070
especially for you.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:36.110
We're in Shanghai now.
We've got to keep up with the times.

00:24:36.110 --> 00:24:38.090
Locals here all wear leather jackets,

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:39.330
jeans, and sneakers.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:40.540
Look at you.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.940
So you've got the jeans and sneakers.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.070
You just need the leather jacket then.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.650
What do you think?

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:50.080
You...

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.220
But I don't have any spare money for this.

00:24:53.730 --> 00:24:55.180
If you're giving it to me for free,
then I'll take it.

00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.040
What about you?

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:56.830
I'll pass.

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:58.640
It's not my style.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:59.750
It's exactly your style.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:00.440
Forget it.

00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:01.440
And you?

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:03.950
I'd rather buy drumsticks
with that money.

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:04.890
I'm not vain.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.310
What do you mean vain?

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:08.920
I-I'll look around some more then.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:10.920
No hard feelings if we don't make a deal.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:12.110
Feel free to ask me for anything.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.960
Or ask Lei.

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:13.920
He's my best friend.

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.640
-Lei.
-Lei.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:17.310
-I'm off then.
-Okay.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.720
-Bye-bye.
-Bye-bye.

00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:19.480
Take care.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.170
Whose turn is it?

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.750
Careful!

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.060
Saving money to go visit Xiaodan?

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.660
You're quite devoted.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.380
Of course.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.760
Do you think things will work out

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:40.910
between you and Xiaodan?

00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:42.640
Why not?

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.400
We're... Good.

00:25:48.750 --> 00:25:50.410
She's in college in Shanghai.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:54.910
So what if she's in Shanghai?

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.050
Even though she's not by my side,

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.680
our bond won't be broken.

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.810
Exactly. So what if she's in Shanghai?

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.110
Back then,

00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.960
many couples at our plant lived apart,

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.310
but in the end they still
got back together.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.510
Jobs were assigned back then.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:07.610
No one's giving you any job now, you know?

00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:08.880
It's even better that way.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:11.440
If no one's giving you a job,
you can go wherever you want.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.350
Yeah, I've been thinking.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:16.100
After Xiaodan graduates,

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.710
if she wants to come back,

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.310
we'll do something here.

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:24.110
If she doesn't want to come back,

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.280
I'll go find a job in Shanghai.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.270
Do we have any dried sausages left?

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:32.590
Yes.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.390
Give him some.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.240
He's meeting his father-in-law.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.700
He can't go empty-handed.

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.830
No need.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:38.680
Take some, you silly boy.

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.540
You're still wet behind the ears.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:41.680
Am I thinking it wrong?

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.940
Xiaodan and I are fine.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.720
Nothing's wrong.

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.490
Your heart is in the right place.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.040
Just go... Just go get the sausages.

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.750
Poking your nose into others' business.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.880
He's being silly,
and you're blindly going along with him?

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.070
Senior Chen, you said

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:55.550
film and architecture use the same method

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.350
to construct a space.

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.400
How do you say that in French again?

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.200
Montage.

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.860
-Mon... Mon...
-Montage.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.920
Montage.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.360
Are you going to study abroad?

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.020
No, I'm not.

00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.660
Senior Chen's planning to study abroad.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.550
I'm just attending lectures
and doing research.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:14.550
That's enough for me.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:16.280
At most, I'll go on a study tour.

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.880
Besides, Xiaoman is still at the plant.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.830
We only see each other once a year,

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:21.750
twice at most.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.570
I don't want to be apart from him
for too long.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:29.270
This is the money for...

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.200
Accommodation.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.960
Food.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.290
What can I do with
just this 100 yuan left?

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:37.850
In the mall,

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.810
we can't just have a meal.
I need to take her shopping.

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:44.480
Where can I get some more money?

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:45.680
It's all fixed.

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.960
Let me know if you need anything else.

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.550
Xiaoman,

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:49.680
here is 40 yuan for you.

00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.350
Okay. Thank you, Ma'am.

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.410
I should thank you.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:54.350
Call me if any neighbors need help.

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.880
If you need anything,

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:55.550
I'll come anytime, Ma'am.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:56.920
-Okay.
-I'll take the trash out.

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:57.200
Okay.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.070
Come on, go back inside.

00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:59.880
Okay. Thanks, Xiaoman. Take care.

00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.550
Bye, Ma'am.

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:08.590
Go up and re-check it for that old lady.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.310
Mr. Ding, what's this for?

00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.240
Everyone in the plant
knows that Xiaoman is

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.820
going to Shanghai to visit Xiaodan,

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.680
so we've given all the work to him.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.240
You... You're being a little
too kind to him.

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.700
I'm getting a bit jealous.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:24.190
Just go upstairs.

I...

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.640
I'm doing the work,
and I have to get kicked?

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.000

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.550
Fan, you're here.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.030
Do you have a computer to assemble,

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:40.350
or are you bringing me some business?

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.240
You set up an experience zone, right?

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.550

00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:44.400
to try it out.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:45.720

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:46.030
Okay.

Go ahead and enjoy yourselves.

-Okay.

Let me be clear upfront—

00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.830
I don't have money to buy a computer.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.030
You should talk to Eight about this.

00:29:06.030 --> 00:29:07.180
He'd definitely be interested.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.050
Eight's more suited for an internet cafe.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:10.580
How can he be the same as you?

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:12.590

Don't you have to pay at an internet cafe?

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.440
And what the school computer lab has

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:22.680
is a LAN,

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.110
We used to play here all the time.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.960
T-This is amazing.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.680
This is called information retrieval,

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.350
understand?

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.670
Do you think you can find this
in the school computer lab?

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.930
And can it be this fast?

00:29:57.550 --> 00:29:59.720
So why did I bring you here today?

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:02.440
I just want you to get a feel
for the future.

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:05.160
Gaming and chatting in internet cafes
is expensive.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.020
It's not as convenient as
buying your own computer.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.550
See? I knew you wanted me
to buy a computer.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.750
But I didn't expect

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:12.550
to find our plant here.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:13.240
East Chemical Plant.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.440
This... This is our family quarters.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.350
That's normal.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.080
Let me show you something else.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:18.770
Look.

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:21.720
[Experience a different kind of
aerial journey]

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.440
This

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:24.350
is a BBS related to us.

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.630
It's the most popular BBS in Shanghai
right now.

00:30:27.650 --> 00:30:29.050
You can search for it too.

00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:30.160
Right.

00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.520
That's right.

00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.680
That's right.

00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:38.720
Look, it covers food, housing,
and transport in Shanghai,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.450
as well as work-related stuff.

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:41.360
Right.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.680
This is the Arts section.

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.510
So it's all about art in here, isn't it?

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:46.200
Can't you search for something serious?

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:46.960
Stop looking at art.

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.510
What does art have to do with you?

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:49.970
Scroll down. Scroll down.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:51.030
Look at the jobs.

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:52.360
What counts as serious?

00:30:52.930 --> 00:30:54.410
This is right. See?

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:56.030
There really is.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.490
-There really is.
-Right?

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.550
Do you have MSN?

00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:01.000
MSN?

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.960
No.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:05.010
Isn't that just
an instant communication tool?

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.550
We've got our cell phones, phone numbers,

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:08.610
and text messages.

00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:10.110
So what do we need that for?

00:31:10.110 --> 00:31:11.390
You can't even carry it around with you.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.110
Look.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.720
I knew you've gotten dumb
from studying at school.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.550
Nowadays, many foreign countries

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.070
have gone paperless—

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:21.060
work is all done through the internet.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:23.350
As long as you have the internet—

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.110
think of it this way.

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:26.270
If the computer is a car,

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.110
then the internet is the highway.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.160
It leads you

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:32.790
towards the future. Got it?

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:35.440
You guys keep eating.

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.930
Xiaoman, have some sweet and sour pork.

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:53.790
Right, here.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.820
Have some Coke.

00:32:00.690 --> 00:32:01.620
I'm telling you,

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.070
don't make that face

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.140
when you're out and about—

00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:07.290
you're asking for a beating.

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:08.200
I...

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.290
I have a favor to ask you.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.960
What is it?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:12.750
Well,

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.350
Xiaoman, you've been working on that

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:20.010
pipeline project at our plant,
and you've made quite a lot, right?

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.240
You want to borrow money?
I don't have any.

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:22.830
Xiaoman.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:24.660
My dear Xiaoman.

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.790
I don't have any money. I really don't.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:28.350
Well, I know

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:32.230
you're saving up to visit Xiaodan
in Shanghai.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.880
But you helped Zhuang Sen.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.400
You can't leave me out.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.480
That's not cool.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:37.300
Besides,

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.000
even if you leave everyone else out,
you can't leave me out, right?

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.720
What do you mean not cool?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.030
Zhuang Sen went to a big city

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.510
to p-pursue his dreams, right?

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:49.510
To complete his life experience.

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.040
What about you? You're fed
three meals a day at home,

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:52.830
and you sleep as soon as you get back.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:54.290
What do you need money for?

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.710
Love is my dream.

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.400
I was already tight on cash.

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.120
After I started dating Lulu,

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:03.440
I had to split every penny in half,
you know?

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.790
Things have gotten even tighter.

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.400
Exactly. You don't make much,

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.270
yet you're spending money on dating.

00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.070
Don't you have any idea
how much you actually have?

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:16.810
Dear Xiaoman, can you please
think about it?

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.920
You see, here's the thing about
borrowing money—

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.380
you have to pay back
however much you borrow.

00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:24.830
Of course I'll pay it back.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:26.810
I'll pay you as soon as I have money.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.110
You have a fixed amount of income
every month,

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.200
and it's not enough to begin with.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.550
If you borrow money from others

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:34.200
and take it home,

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.440
you're invisibly adding

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.310
so much pressure on yourself, right?

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.880
Right.

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:39.970
Isn't that asking for trouble?

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.590
You should think about it this way.

00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:44.790
If someone gives you money
that you don't have to pay back,

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.240
wouldn't that be great?

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.570
Of course it'd be great.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.790
I-If I don't borrow from him then,

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.440
wouldn't I be a fool?

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:53.970
Alright.

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:56.390
I've thought this through for you.

00:33:56.390 --> 00:33:57.680
If you have nothing better to do,

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.080
in the mornings, evenings, or on holidays,

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.750
don't go running around.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.310
Come out with me to do some work.

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:07.510
I can make up

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:09.030
a-all that little "dating fund"

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.159
y-you and Lulu need.

00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:11.770
I get it now.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:15.250
So you want me to work on
this pipeline project with you?

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:16.710
Doesn't that sound good?

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.440
Okay, okay.

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:19.880
But let's agree on daily settlement.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.840
If you don't pay me,

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.880
I'll go to Mr. Ding

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:23.290
and take your 100 yuan.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:24.360
Look at you, so unambitious.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.190
Would I cheat you out of money?

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:26.389
Would I owe you money?

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:28.030
All these years, only you guys
have owed me money.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:29.760
When have I ever owed you money?

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.030
Thanks, Xiaoman.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.710
This Shanghai liquor

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:37.570
just can't compare to
the Northeastern moonshine.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.400
Look how high
your standards are, Yan. Seriously.

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.060
Just make do with it. Alright?

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.840
So many?

00:34:46.929 --> 00:34:47.560
It's done.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.250
Great, it's done.

00:34:49.250 --> 00:34:51.449
The internet speed here is really fast.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:54.280
Growing up together—

00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:55.800
and they're still together now.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:57.710
This must've been written in the stars.

00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:58.960
Xia Lei is a good kid.

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.480
Tell him

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:01.760
to come here for dinner

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:02.920
more often on weekends,

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.500
and that he doesn't have to
stand on ceremony here.

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:06.100
Okay, I'll tell him.

00:35:06.490 --> 00:35:08.940
I've liked Xia Lei since he was little.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:10.190
He's always loved to study.

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.800
Look, as soon as he got here,

00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:14.070
he went straight to the computer.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.590
He's just single-mindedly
devoted to studying.

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:17.440
I like that.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.020
Look at you.

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:20.750
You're implying something.

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.590
Don't overthink it.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:23.590
Okay.

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.800
By the way, I saw something called

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:27.110
a BBS earlier. Look.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.320
What BBS?

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:29.600
It talks a lot about

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:30.710
art stuff.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:32.400
I noticed the discussions in there
were quite intense.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.400
I thought you might find it helpful.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.560
Dongdong.

00:35:42.190 --> 00:35:43.840
How's your sawing coming along?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.320
-How come you still haven't finished yet?
-Xiaoman.

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:46.960
The whole building is out of water
and waiting for this pipe.

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:47.820
Hurry up, okay?

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:48.620
Wait, wait.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.190
We agreed before we came

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.760
that my job would just be
lifting and carrying.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.960
But look at me now—sawing,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.190
then I'll have to do the installing.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:57.190
Do you expect me to do all this work
by myself?

00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:58.400
What work have you done?
You've only been sawing pipes.

00:35:58.400 --> 00:35:59.400
I've been busy up there for so long.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.190
What have you done?

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:01.920
Hey, y-you can't just focus on...

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.850
I-I've still got 4 more pipes here.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.400
I can't possibly get it done that fast.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.460
This isn't an electric saw, you know?

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:08.590
Do you still want to eat meat or not?

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:08.960
I do.

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:10.840
Do you still want to buy popcorn or not?

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:11.320
I do.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.630
Then just hurry up and do your work.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.320
Yeah, I'm on it. I'm on it.

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:15.000
If you keep dawdling, I'll dock your pay.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.060
You can dock my pay,

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:18.690
but before you do that, don't you think

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:19.920
you should give me my pay first?

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:21.290
I haven't seen a dime all day—

00:36:21.290 --> 00:36:22.290
only a few drinks.

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:23.400
So your happiness counts,

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.000
and mine counts for nothing?

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:26.030
Are you stupid?

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.320
Who pays you
when the job is only half done?

00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:29.120
Who does that?

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.030
I've been working since this morning.
Look what time it is now.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.590
I don't care what time it is.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:32.210
Even if it takes until next year,

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.150
you won't get paid until you finish.

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.840
-Just hurry up, okay?
-♪ We workers have the power ♪

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.370
♪ We workers have the power ♪

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:40.410
Look at all this dilly-dallying.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:42.400
Anything with a stick,

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.320
a pipe, or running water,

00:36:44.350 --> 00:36:46.150
we've basically fixed them all.

00:36:46.590 --> 00:36:48.880
But we've only done one household
in all these days.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.110
At this rate,

00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:51.920
forget about going to Shanghai—

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.310
you'll struggle to
even get past Shanhaiguan.

00:36:53.310 --> 00:36:56.030
Lulu and I might also end up breaking up
because of this.

00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:58.510
I've thought about this carefully.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:00.150
In our plant,

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.200
most people started as workers.

00:37:02.590 --> 00:37:04.800
They don't need to hire anyone
for this kind of work.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.590
They can do it themselves, right?

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:08.840
We're just practicing in our plant now.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.320
My ultimate goal

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.960
is to expand our business

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.800
to Tiecheng.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.260
There's more work there.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.400
Tiecheng? Better stay in our plant.

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.910
Competition is so fierce nowadays,
you know?

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:21.930
I'm putting it here, Madam.

00:37:21.930 --> 00:37:24.330
Even sweet potato vendors fight over turf.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:26.630
Nonsense.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.590
We are skilled workers, you know?

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:32.320
We can't be rough like that.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.000
If we do this job well

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:36.630
and ensure top quality,

00:37:36.630 --> 00:37:39.630
we'll definitely have plenty of money
and work there.

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.800
Then go if you want.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.360
I'm going to see monkeys with Lulu
this afternoon.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:45.160
What monkeys?

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.380
In our park, the one nearby,

00:37:48.590 --> 00:37:49.880
there's a monkey show.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:53.200
Lulu really has a thing for that.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:55.960
She's with you every day
and still wants to see a monkey show?

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.760
Is that show any better than you?

00:38:31.590 --> 00:38:32.590
You're auditing the class here,

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:35.250
so stop eating something
that smells so strong.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.360
Almost there.

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.000
Mr. Fan.

00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:49.590
You're in the computer business now?

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.320
You're here.

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.800
What do you think? Awesome, right?

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.000
I bought these two
from students returning from abroad.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.200
They're so new.

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.520
It... It'll be a shame to sell them.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:01.790
Model 486. See if you like it.

00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:04.000
If you do, take one.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.190
I do,

00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.360
but I can't afford it. Let's go.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.970
As Communication Engineering majors,

00:39:09.970 --> 00:39:12.030
isn't it weird to not have computers?

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:12.960
It is.

00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:14.320
None of us have computers.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:15.450
So we have to buy one.

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.960
Look how nice this is.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:20.990
How much is it?

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:22.790
Don't talk to me about money.

00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.230
How vulgar. If you like it, just take one.

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:26.340
Take one?

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:28.300
Even if you gave it to me for free,
I couldn't take it.

00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.650
Wait... If you give it to me,
I'll take it.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:30.400
No, no, no.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.510
I didn't mean for free.

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:34.280
I meant
however much I paid for this computer

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.590
is how much I'll sell it to you for.

00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.250
That's still too expensive.
We can't afford it.

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.190
I can see you don't know much about
national affairs.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:42.630
Nowadays, people can get a mortgage

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:44.560
from the bank to buy a house.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:45.760
The same goes for this computer.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.070
You can pay for it in installments.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:49.630
I'm sure you can pay it off
within your 4 years of college.

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.630
Yes or no? Give me a straight answer.

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.560
Yes. We want one.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:53.630
Why are you saying yes?

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:55.630
You don't even know how much it is...

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.400
Great deal, isn't it?

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.000
Senior Fan has already given us his word.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.590
Just grant me this wish, okay?

00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:00.840
How about we split it?

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.190
You and I can
pay the installments together.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.990
It's settled.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:04.570
Senior Fan, we want one.

00:40:04.590 --> 00:40:05.050
Move it.

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:05.650
Move it.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.190
Look at Eight's attitude.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.400
What do you mean move it...

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.480
Shut up and move it.

00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:14.730
What...

00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.630
What the heck?

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.680
W-Where is the leak coming from?

00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:22.030
The second floor!

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.550
Didn't you tighten the valve?

00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:25.670
I-I don't know!

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.280
It's leaking!
Water is flowing into the hallway!

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.140
We're done for.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.280
We're done for.

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:30.840
The master valve...

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:32.440
Where's the master valve, Sis?

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:33.070
Where's the master valve?

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:34.400
You have to find
the safety master valve first and...

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:34.920
Mr. Ding...

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:36.720
Hurry up and notify that family.

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:38.000
Their house has been flooded. Quick.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.360
Xiaoman, your skills are truly amazing.

00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:40.470
Look at all this flood—

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.400
Saying that at a time like this, huh?

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:42.030
Hurry up!

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.140
Come up with me.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.860
But Mr. Ding, he's the one
who caused the leak!

00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.000
Why did you hit me again?

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.760
Hurry up and n-notify...

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.070
Notify that family on the first floor,

00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:48.670
Dongdong.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.680
It's over. It's all over.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.510
So over.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:01.320
Hey, everyone, stop for a second.

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:05.070
Let me

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.770
reintroduce these two classmates to you.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.210
One is Nezha, who wreaked havoc
in the Dragon Palace.

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.370
The other is Monkey King
from the Water Curtain Cave.

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.440
These two classmates,

00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:18.150
thinking their skills were up to par,

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:19.150
went out to work.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.840
You didn't even check the water pressure

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.620
before starting work?

00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:27.960
Don't you know that
residential buildings use water pumps?

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.880
They just turned on the valve

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.480
after connecting the pipes.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:33.840
All the water pipes in that hallway burst.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:36.500
Now it really has become
the Water Curtain Cave.

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.720
How did those people
even dare to hire them?

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.440
Why wouldn't they?

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.070
We showed them our student IDs.

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.670
We're professionally trained.

00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:46.760
Give it a rest, will you?

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.290
You still dare to talk back?

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:49.280
Very well.

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:53.070
They're the top students
of our technical school now.

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:54.940
The whole city knows about it.

00:41:56.190 --> 00:41:58.230
If Mr. Ding hadn't acted fast,

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.650
the consequences
would have been unimaginable.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:04.920
Mr. Ding is always
cleaning up your messes.

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.380
He's a Grade 8 turner,

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.100
yet he had to go door to door
to apologize for you.

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.710
Mr. Ding... He cleaned up our mess again?

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.000
With the shoddy work you do,

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.040
you definitely didn't wrap enough hemp

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.060
and didn't tighten the faucet.

00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.760
Also,

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.420
the bend must have be clogged.

00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.140
If Mr. Ding hadn't been

00:42:28.190 --> 00:42:30.150
checking your work right behind you,

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:32.610
how could you have earned money
that easily?

00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:37.400
Remember this. This is a lesson.

00:42:38.230 --> 00:42:39.400
If your technique isn't good enough,

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:40.660
nothing else matters;

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.880
if your skills aren't up to par,

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:44.600
you're nothing.

00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:47.550
Continue with the class!

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:56.190
Well, I just didn't fix it right,
so the pipe burst.
