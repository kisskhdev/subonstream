00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:21.550
Huahua,

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.280
don't be scared.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.640
Let me give you a hug.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.190
Just one hug.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.760
Liu, come on.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.080
Liu.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.350
Another toast.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.950
Huahua…

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.120
Huahua…

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.960
My Huahua…

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.840
Let's play.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.240
Fire!

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.280
Fire!

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.400
Fire! Help!

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.630
My meds.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.430
My meds.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:14.710
My meds.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.280
Fire!

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.190
Fire!

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:52.640
In Qingcheng,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.150
no one talks to me like that.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.480
You want your money back?

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.280
Come on!

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.430
Come take it!

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.200
Give me a hand.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.520
Get rid of this jerk.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.430
Where's the money you promised?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.120
You...

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.080
You're insane.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.470
If it weren't for you,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.520
my daughter wouldn't be dead.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.660

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.700
(Serve the People - Mao Zedong)

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.660
(Teahouse Shareholder; Dog shelter)

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.910
Can we confirm it's the same person?

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.120
I think it's him.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.150
Bai. Bai Qiming.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.840
He hid for 15 years.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.190
How could there be no trace?

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.560
Could he have left the country?

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:22.950
Then he crossed illegally.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.160
Now that he's back,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.870
his target is likely Wang Li.

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.270
Or even

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.680
his daughter.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.600
The dog thieves' handler
was Zhang Ming.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.600
Zhang Ming had someone above him.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.360
But Master,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.950
just like we thought,

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.480
Li Xu's deeply tied to Bai.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.190
In that case,

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.560
it raises the odds

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.190
that Zhang Ming, Bai, and Li Xu

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.040
were all working together.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.120
After that day,

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.870
Hongyun Restaurant suddenly shut down.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:10.920
Wang Li and the staff

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.040
never showed up again.

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.560
If these groups met,

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.190
something big must've happened.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.800
Is Zhang Ming's handler Wang Li or Bai?

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.750
We can't be sure.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.600
What we do know is

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.750
that Zhang Ming is missing.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.390
We should start

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:39.070
where he disappeared.

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.000
That's what I thought too.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.800
So I went to Hongyun.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.240
Guess what I saw.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.120
What are you looking at?

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.510
(Closed Until Further Notice)

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.120
Big sign here. Can't you read?

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.800
Why are you closed?

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:12.680
Felt like it. Any of your business?

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.160
Where's Wang Li?

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:16.480
Where's everyone else?

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.190
Wang Li isn't the owner anymore.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:20.040
Where he went is none of my concern.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.720
Wang Li sold the place to Li Xu?

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.910
Exactly.

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.480
Yimo once told me

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.390
how much Wang Li cared about it.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.750
Selling it suddenly?

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.880
Something's off.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:39.240
I called Xu Qiang too.

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.630
Same story.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.480
No one knows where Zhang Ming is.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:45.310
Zhang Ming missing.

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.360
Restaurant closed.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.390
They're connected.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.840
Master.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.390
I checked Zhang Ming's family.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:56.160
Only his mother's left.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.870
Long-term hospital patient.

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.480
Bedridden.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:01.800
He hasn't shown up for days, right?

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:05.190
Three to five days, at least.

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.270
We find it strange too.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.480
They say long illness
tests a child's devotion.

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.720
But whenever he had time off,

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.160
he came to the hospital.

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:13.800
His mother's illness

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.310
has been treated here

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.630
in our hospital

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
for over a decade.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:21.070
This stay's been long.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.560
Zhang Ming's been a devoted son,

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.000
going to the hospital often.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.070
To vanish this long,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.600
that's not normal.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.000
Either he's hiding with a new plan

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.870
from his handler,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.430
or he's been killed.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.240
Pull everything on Zhang Ming again.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.190
Full profile.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.750
He's a key figure right now.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.870
There's no way he left without a trace,

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:49.310
then just disappeared like that.

00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.870
The police called me.

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.310
I told them what you said.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.080
Good.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.240
Why did we shut down?

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.800
Where's Zhang Ming?

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.560
I'll be honest.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.590
Zhang Ming

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:27.430
teamed up with Bai a long time ago.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:30.790
Back then,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.630
when we buried Bai,

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.600
Zhang Ming realized he wasn't dead

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.600
and let him go.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:43.080
Now Zhang Ming can't handle it.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.000
He ran off with Bai.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.000
I'm closing up.

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:58.030
You've been staring. Which one?

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.240
Bai's back this time

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.320
to kill us.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.000
So I gave the restaurant

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:15.150
to Li Xu,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.280
hoping he'd

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.390
deal with Bai.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.720
If Bai lives,

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.240
none of us will have peace.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.630
What's your plan?

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.790
Strike first.

00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:54.030
Kill Bai.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.600
We did it once back then.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.280
Now,

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:04.360
we do it again now.

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.870
Ali.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:12.670
The past is the past.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:14.550
This is murder.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.910
It's no small matter.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:19.240
Isn't there another way?

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.120
I put Hongyun on the line.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.550
My entire fortune.

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.910
If there were another way,

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.080
would I do this?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.080
But what if

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.600
there's a turn we're missing?

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.150
If we cross this line,

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:32.510
there's no going back.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.270
Let karma get Bai?

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.200
Right now it's either him

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:42.240
or it's us.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:44.790
No middle ground.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.510
Qiang.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:52.720
I ask you one thing.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:57.120
Watch over Yimo.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.630
Keep her safe.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.120
Here.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.270
Zhang Ming's mother, Lin Guifen.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.120
All her hospital records.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:25.110
Thanks.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.960
No problem.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.510
Look here.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.700
(Ultrasound Report; Lin Guifen)

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:37.960
Zhao.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.440
Same routine.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:40.920
Thanks.

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.990
Sure thing.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:46.080
Tang Tang. Your master is over there.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.000
Thanks, Mr. Li.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.390
Ran all morning, I'm starving.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.150
Got anything?

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:55.320
I pulled

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.480
all the medical records with Zhang.

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.560
And found something.

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.240
You always talk

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.030
while eating when anxious.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.510
You'll gulp down air.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.080
Swallow, then speak.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:06.990
Okay.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:07.960
I'll report first.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.200
Zhang Ming

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.360
lived very simply.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:16.630
Basically restaurant to hospital.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:19.670
Poor family background.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:21.270
His biggest expense

00:12:21.270 --> 00:12:22.550
is his mother's treatment.

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:23.870
His mother, Lin Guifen,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120
has been treated

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.720
for 15 years.

00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:29.080
When we pulled up her medical records,

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.200
we found something interesting.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.510
Your dumplings.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:34.960
Thanks, Mr. Li.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.960
- All served, enjoy.
- Thanks.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.030
Alright.

00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:39.120
Here.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.480
Wipe my hands. Okay.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.280
Here, Master.

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:57.870
(Ultrasound Report; Lin Guifen)
His mom

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.510
started treatment here 15 years ago.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:01.080
Three years ago,

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:03.320
she was hospitalized when it worsened.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.670
But before that,

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:05.630
she'd been treated there

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.120
for over 10 years.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.480
This hospital isn't cheap.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.290
The costs over the years

00:13:12.790 --> 00:13:13.790
must've been huge.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.630
Before this,

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:17.390
she was at a rural clinic.

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.480
Which means,

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:21.240
fifteen years ago,

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.270
Zhang Ming suddenly had money.

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:25.030
Enough to move his mother

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:26.550
to the city

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.750
and pay for treatment

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.630
continuously, until now.

00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.600
Fifteen years ago?

00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:39.150
The exact same time frame.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.440
Coincidence?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:43.960
It can't be.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:45.720
This is not a coincidence.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:48.470
Captain,

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:49.750
can I eat now?

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.160
Eat.

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.870
Tang Tang.

00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:58.030
Just looking for you.

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:59.870
Zhang Ming's call records are in.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840
Leave them with me.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:03.680
Okay.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.700
(Caller; Receiver; Qingcheng)

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:21.140
(Caller; Receiver; Qingcheng)

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.270
Stop chewing your pen cap.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.840
You just never listen.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:29.080
Okay, I'll stop.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:32.920
What's on your mind?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.840
Just checking.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:39.510
We've got all the case leads.

00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.030
Why the long face?

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:42.510
I'm fine.

00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.080
Back at lunch time,

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:48.790
you were full of confidence.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.320
Master.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:54.870
I'm just thinking

00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:58.440
our clues mostly line up.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.600
Pretty much.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.320
But Zhang Ming's missing.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.200
Without him, we can't prove anything.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.000
Wang Li's people

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.120
are clearly hiding something.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.270
We haven't cracked them yet.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.240
There's another angle

00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:18.200
you haven't pursued.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.390
Master.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.000
Fifteen years ago,

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:32.360
Wang Yimo was just a kid.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.790
She couldn't have been involved.

00:15:36.150 --> 00:15:38.150
If I bring her in, what do I even ask?

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:39.350
Besides,

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:41.360
she's been studying away from home

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.720
all these years.

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.320
Even if Wang Li broke the law,

00:15:45.630 --> 00:15:47.120
it has nothing to do with her.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:02.120
Didn't you already have a theory?

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:12.630
You've been spaced out lately.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:14.390
What matters most in investigations?

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.480
Eliminate the impossible.

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:18.030
Even if you don't want to,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.360
you have to face the facts.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.270
Face the truth.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.680
Master.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.840
What do I ask her?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.480
I don't even know where to start.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.030
So why even bring her in?

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.120
She worked at the restaurant.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:34.910
Calls with Xu Qiang and Zhang Ming

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:36.390
are normal.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:37.390
I...

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.120
I just wanted to discuss

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:41.840
to see if there's a new direction.

00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:43.200
It's right there.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.270
Ask first, then see what comes out.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.390
How many times do I have to say it?

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:51.150
You're a detective.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:52.120
You're working a case.

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.550
This isn't about personal feelings.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.670
Personal?

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.630
That's harsh.

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:01.480
I'm just trying to talk it through

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.750
to see if there's a new angle.

00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:05.510
The direction's been pointed out.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:08.790
What are you two arguing about?

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.680
Heard the racket

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.000
from outside.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.270
Still not home, Mr. Qin?

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:17.160
Don't ask.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:19.240
I skipped my physical check last month

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.400
just for the attendance bonus.

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.590
The report came back,

00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:24.510
and my wife

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.030
chewed me out.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.110
She's still fuming.

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.550
I wouldn't dare go home.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:36.920
What show

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.510
are you two putting on?

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.440
What else?

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:44.200
The same old.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.000
The clues from the case

00:17:47.550 --> 00:17:48.830
are all loose ends.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.030
Nothing ties together.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:53.000
Everyone at Hongyun,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.400
especially Wang Li,

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.200
has links to Bai.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.160
But nothing shows

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:01.240
what they did in the Naked Banquet Case

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.440
15 years ago.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.830
So we're discussing

00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.070
to see if there's something

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.340
that could tie things together.

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.000
Then infer it.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.270
For us cops,

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:18.590
not every case comes with solid proof.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.040
We hypothesize.

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.640
Listen.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.680
About this Naked Banquet Case,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.350
I know every

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.000
existing clue by heart.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.030
Here's the situation.

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.070
Wang Li,

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.480
the restaurant owner.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.510
What role could he play?

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.080
Organizer?

00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:42.350
Unlikely.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.160
Participant? Not high enough.

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.480
So maybe support staff.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.550
Restaurant support?

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:55.590
Kitchen help?

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.720
Kitchen help from that restaurant?

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.350
That fits.

00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:03.400
Wild guessing?

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:06.160
Definitely not.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.680
It's a bold assumption.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:14.000
Basic detective work.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:15.480
Alright.

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:16.920
Kitchen help.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:28.480
My wife

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:31.680
just approved me going home.

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:33.400
I'm heading out first.

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.910
Right.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.480
You two, stop arguing.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:38.960
Talk it out.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.440
Alright.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.800
I'm off.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:48.630
Right.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.960
The files are in.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:55.840
Here.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.160
Be nice.

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.550
No more arguing.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.400
Kitchen help?

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.160
Qin makes sense.

00:20:14.790 --> 00:20:16.160
You really buy that?

00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.790
You believe that but not me?

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.240
Stop blinking.

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.590
Wang Yimo gets questioned tomorrow.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.760
That's an order.

00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.240
Bad habit.

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:45.700
(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.590
Tang Tang.

00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:53.110
Tang.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:04.340
(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.800
Oh right.

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.640
(Consecrated Amulet)

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.000
I got this amulet for you.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.720
As a police officer, you face danger a lot.

00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:15.720
I'm giving this to you.

00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:17.440
Keep it on you.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.470
It'll bring you good luck.

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:27.280
Thanks.

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:30.350
I should get going now.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:31.960
Thanks for today.

00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.300
Bye.

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:46.390
Bye.

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.350
I heard from Wang you're leaving.

00:21:53.510 --> 00:21:54.550
You didn't mention it.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.680
Yeah. My dad and I talked.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:58.310
Hongyun's been running for years.

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.200
It was exhausting.

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:01.590
We've saved some money.

00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:02.750
I can earn now.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.240
So I want him to move to a big city
and be with me.

00:22:06.510 --> 00:22:07.880
Your accountant, Zhang Ming,

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:09.920
heard from him lately?

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.110
Not for a few days.

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.110
Since the restaurant closed,
I haven't gone there.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:20.640
Take a look at this.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:23.790
This is Zhang Ming's call record.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.680
(Caller; Receiver; Qingcheng)
The day you almost got hurt,

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.750
after I took the two livestream guys away,

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.790
you called Zhang Ming.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.200
What did you talk about?

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.400
That day,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.550
his mom's condition suddenly worsened.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:40.590
He needed money urgently.

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.240
I called to ask

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.000
if he'd reached my dad.

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.240
It got resolved later.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.160
How well did you know Zhang Ming?

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:57.920
He'd been at the restaurant over ten years.

00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.440
So I saw him often.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.550
But you know, Ming

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.600
is devoted to his family.

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.400
Especially for his mom.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.640
He's given up a lot for her.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.550
Once I overheard him on the phone.

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.310
Sounded like

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:14.510
he was taking side jobs.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.310
But I'm not sure

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.750
about the specifics.

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:29.500
(Qingcheng Public Security Bureau)

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:15.670
Qiang.

00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:17.590
Yimo, go!

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.000
Go!

00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:28.000
Qiang!

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.880
Go! Now!

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:18.110
Excuse me.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.480
Which room is Xu Qiang in?

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:21.240
He just woke up.

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:22.310
Over there. Room 31.

00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.480
Thanks.

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.940
(Ward 4)

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:42.480
Qiang.

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:44.390
Bai…

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.000
Bai…

00:25:48.550 --> 00:25:50.040
- Bai.
- What's with Bai?

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:55.880
Ali, I...

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:01.520
Bai...

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.000
Bai's people are after Yimo.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:08.030
You were stabbed by his people?

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:15.110
Protect Yimo.

00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:19.590
I will.

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.550
Doctor, how is Xu Qiang?

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.350
The wound is fairly deep,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.240
but no major vessels were hit.

00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:28.060
There was blood loss,

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:29.260
but he's safe now.

00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:32.820
When can he be discharged?

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.060
We recommend

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.860
two more days of observation.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.900
He's not stable yet.

00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:41.380
Thank you, doctor.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.110
You are…

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.780
Mr. Wang Li, right?

00:26:58.180 --> 00:26:59.040
And you are?

00:26:59.060 --> 00:26:59.900
Zhao Fengcheng.

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.700
My partner Tang Tang mentions you often.

00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:05.060
Captain Zhao.

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:06.980
Nice to meet you.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:12.580
Let's step outside for a quick chat.

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:25.740
Sorry.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:28.980
(Student File; Wang Yimo; Birth Certificate)

00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.740
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.060
Dad, how's Qiang?

00:27:55.020 --> 00:27:55.980
He was stabbed.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.660
He'll be fine.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.660
Really?

00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.140
Yimo,

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.060
don't go anywhere.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.980
Be careful.

00:28:14.940 --> 00:28:17.580
This will be resolved soon.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.260
Dad,

00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:22.540
I went to the station today.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:24.820
I think Tang Tang and his team

00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:26.460
are already suspecting you.

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.540
I know. It's fine.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:32.620
I have a plan.

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:35.020
What plan?

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.740
This will be resolved soon.

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:42.100
It'll be over.

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.420
Trust me.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:47.420
All I want

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.540
is for you to be safe.

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:02.740
Zhang Ming?

00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:05.140
Zhang Ming

00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:07.620
is a devoted son.

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.820
His mom's been ill and in the hospital.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.860
It costs a lot of money.

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:14.780
After I shut the restaurant,

00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:16.900
the pressure on him got worse.

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.740
We'd been friends for over ten years.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.660
I feel guilty.

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:23.740
I couldn't help much.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:25.260
So after that,

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:28.340
we hardly kept in touch.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:29.900
Haven't seen him since.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.340
When was the last time

00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.300
you saw him?

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:39.780
Are you interrogating me?

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:41.860
No.

00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:43.780
Just getting some info.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.220
Ali,

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.180
I know you want to find Bai.

00:29:56.820 --> 00:29:57.740
A few days ago,

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.220
I found a chance

00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.100
to check his location.

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:03.340
Not long after I left,

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.380
Li Xu showed up.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:10.460
I think

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.700
they're planning something against you.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:22.700
Li Tong,

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.860
when you found Bai,

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.820
why didn't you tell me right away?

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.580
I wanted to.

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.460
I was afraid you'd go after him alone

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:37.860
and get hurt.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.020
You know what Bai's like.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.020
So do I.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:42.710
Besides,

00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:44.060
he's got Caicai right by his side.

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:47.660
Ali,

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:49.900
don't do anything reckless.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.780
Send me Bai's location.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:00.100
Yimo's safety matters more than my life.

00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.180
(Resident ID)

00:33:59.020 --> 00:33:59.860
Master,

00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.220
the substation sent the footage
of Xu Qiang's stabbing.

00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.220
It's in the old neighborhood

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:06.260
two blocks away.

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:07.620
No cameras inside the alley.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:09.250
Wang Yimo's caught on the entrance feed,

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.380
and that unidentified guy

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.740
went in right after her.

00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.740
At the time of the attack,

00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:16.540
Wang Yimo ran out first,

00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:17.620
then the guy.

00:34:17.700 --> 00:34:19.540
A passerby found Xu Qiang

00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:20.380
and called it in.

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:23.420
So close to us.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:24.780
That's way too bold.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.140
Does the unidentified guy

00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:29.980
look like him?

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.100
Yes.

00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:37.740
I think it's the same guy.

00:34:40.340 --> 00:34:41.780
If so,

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.980
his target may be Wang Yimo.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.420
Do you still think

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.940
she has nothing to do with this?

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:58.580
What now?

00:34:59.370 --> 00:35:00.460
Every time she's mentioned,

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.940
you react like this.

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.340
No, Master.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.180
The whole thing

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:09.580
just freaks me out.

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:14.460
Everyone we've spotted lately

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:16.180
is now connected somehow.

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.660
Something's about to happen.

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.060
Captain Zhao.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:24.220
A skeleton

00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:26.580
was found by the road near Shanquan Village.

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.110
Captain Zhao.

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.060
Road maintenance found a bag

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.700
this morning and reported it.

00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:01.580
Captain Zhao, it's found during inspection.

00:36:02.540 --> 00:36:04.740
(Liu Xijun)

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:25.500
(Police)

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.540
Mr. Wang,

00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:37.300
Bai's been found.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:38.780
He told me

00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:42.140
he wants to throw another banquet

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.540
just for you.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:08.300
Yimo.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.540
Don't get up. Stay still.

00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:22.980
Why are you here?

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.940
Qiang.

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.860
I'm sorry.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.700
You got hurt because of me.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.580
It's okay.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.180
That day,

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:45.020
why were you there?

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.700
Your dad said

00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:51.380
you might be in danger.

00:37:53.540 --> 00:37:54.820
I wanted to protect you.

00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:03.700
Yimo,

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.340
you should go home.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.660
Stay there.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:11.660
Don't go out.

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.060
If anything feels off,

00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:14.900
just

00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.660
call the police.

00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:19.660
Tang Tang, right?

00:38:22.460 --> 00:38:24.180
He truly wants to help you.

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.180
I can tell.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.380
Yimo,

00:38:34.540 --> 00:38:35.380
don't cry.

00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:39.060
Don't cry.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.060
For me, it's not worth it.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.020
Qiang...

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:52.740
Yimo.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:55.540
Go.

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.820
Everything gets pricier around New Year.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:36.820
Look.

00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.500
This isn't the kid from before.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:40.860
Something's definitely off with them.

00:40:41.220 --> 00:40:42.060
Right?

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:52.100
Pig trotter soup's ready.

00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:53.380
Here you go.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.300
What's on your mind?

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.660
My teacher assigned an essay.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:02.780
The topic is

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:03.900
"My Dad."

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.100
That's a good one.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.860
What are you going to write?

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:07.900
I've got it.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.140
I wrote that my dad is

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.860
a food magician.

00:41:12.020 --> 00:41:13.620
In our tiny Kitchen,

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.940
he can whip up a table
full of my favorite dishes.

00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:18.460
That's my one big talent

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:19.620
and you found that.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.420
I also wrote,

00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:23.780
my dad is the bravest person.

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:25.420
When him around,

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:26.620
I'm not afraid of anything.

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:29.380
Try it.

00:41:36.540 --> 00:41:37.940
Dad, it's tasty.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.300
Then I'll make it for you every day.

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.020
Pig trotter soup's ready.

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.060
What's on your mind?

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.020
Dad,

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.420
thank you for everything.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.740
Being your daughter these years

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:16.180
has made me happy.

00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:19.280
Why bring this up all of a sudden?

00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.380
Tasty.

00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:30.850
Then I'll make it for you

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:32.620
every day.
