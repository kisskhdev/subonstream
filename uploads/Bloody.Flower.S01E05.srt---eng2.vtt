00:00:52.215 --> 00:00:55.145
We've just received
some unbelievable news.

00:00:55.585 --> 00:00:57.115
Serial killer Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:00:57.115 --> 00:01:00.025
who had captured national attention
and sparked heated debate...

00:01:00.285 --> 00:01:02.995
has saved a terminally ill patient.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:11.535
Following reports that patient Woo Jin,
has made a complete recovery,

00:01:11.865 --> 00:01:16.205
the court will face greater difficulty
in its sentencing deliberations.

00:01:16.275 --> 00:01:17.435
(Prosecution Case Inquiry)

00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:20.475
If you dig too deep into this,

00:01:21.345 --> 00:01:24.575
you're the one who could get hurt.

00:01:24.645 --> 00:01:26.015
(Suspension of Indictment
for Insufficient Evidence)

00:01:26.085 --> 00:01:27.085
(Regarding Shin Ho Chang's case)

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:28.415
A medical demonstration?

00:01:29.185 --> 00:01:30.385
What kind of nonsense is this?

00:01:48.135 --> 00:01:49.775
Hey. Did you order food?

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:51.805
No, I didn't.

00:01:57.875 --> 00:01:59.185
Who are you?

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.255
Hello. I...

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.985
I'm Chae Jeong Su,
the chairman of Chaeum Medical Center.

00:02:25.035 --> 00:02:27.745
What brings you here?

00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:33.385
First, I'd like to thank you.

00:02:34.185 --> 00:02:35.555
What do you mean by that?

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:39.655
Thanks to you, Mr. Park,
Lee Woo Gyeom's procedure was a success.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:43.995
And the final verdict
will surely be in his favor.

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.965
This means patients ruined
by incurable diseases...

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.565
can finally receive treatment.

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:54.235
I only did my best for my client
as his attorney.

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:56.875
And the trial isn't even over yet.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.305
How is your daughter doing?

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:04.545
Excuse me?

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.615
I saw it on the news.

00:03:13.485 --> 00:03:14.525
Mr. Park.

00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:19.225
Do you really think
the court will execute a man...

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:20.665
who saved a life?

00:03:22.365 --> 00:03:26.665
The National Assembly
can't ignore public opinion,

00:03:26.935 --> 00:03:29.175
and they'll eventually use Lee Woo Gyeom
to treat patients.

00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:31.905
So, how will they decide who gets treated?

00:03:33.175 --> 00:03:34.875
For the sake of fairness, they'll
probably...

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.375
use a lottery system, don't you think?

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:42.515
What are you getting at?

00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:44.915
Chaeum will be...

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:47.155
the organization that makes the selection.

00:03:50.325 --> 00:03:54.465
For patients who need urgent treatment,
like your daughter,

00:03:54.725 --> 00:03:58.735
Chaeum wants to develop a cure
from Lee Woo Gyeom's blood.

00:03:59.135 --> 00:04:01.235
To develop the cure,
could you be on our side...

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:04.305
and persuade Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:04:12.345 --> 00:04:13.615
For your daughter's sake.

00:04:56.355 --> 00:04:58.755
(Achilles' Heel)

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:01.465
(Lee Woo Gyeom's demo
may cure the incurable.)

00:05:01.525 --> 00:05:02.635
(Medical demo between prison and court)

00:05:02.695 --> 00:05:03.695
(Components in Lee Woo Gyeom's blood
are key.)

00:05:03.765 --> 00:05:05.265
(People call for
a steady supply of his blood.)

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:07.965
This is insane.

00:05:08.605 --> 00:05:11.075
Public opinion,
which condemned Lee Woo Gyeom until now,

00:05:11.405 --> 00:05:14.975
has swung over 30 percent in his favor.
People are so fickle.

00:05:15.045 --> 00:05:16.045
It's understandable.

00:05:16.475 --> 00:05:18.445
It was the lead story on foreign news too.

00:05:20.445 --> 00:05:23.585
I wonder if Lee Woo Gyeom's cure
could get rid of this scar.

00:05:24.355 --> 00:05:26.525
It drives me crazy
every time I look in the mirror.

00:05:26.885 --> 00:05:28.325
Hey, look at this.

00:05:29.355 --> 00:05:30.355
Look.

00:05:32.625 --> 00:05:33.625
Isn't this hilarious?

00:05:34.195 --> 00:05:35.265
People are going wild.

00:05:35.265 --> 00:05:36.265
(Contains his power for reborn skin!)

00:05:38.595 --> 00:05:40.965
But isn't that actually possible?

00:05:41.665 --> 00:05:45.205
Totally. I mean,
they cured an incurable disease.

00:05:46.605 --> 00:05:47.745
Wait a second.

00:05:48.145 --> 00:05:51.275
Maybe I should make a business proposition
to Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:05:51.475 --> 00:05:52.915
What kind of business?

00:05:53.415 --> 00:05:56.715
Developing a hair loss treatment.
With millions bald, if you made that,

00:05:56.785 --> 00:05:58.055
you'd be sitting on a gold mine.

00:05:58.415 --> 00:05:59.625
Mr. Park, where are you going?

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:03.895
I'm going to check on Min Seo.

00:06:05.025 --> 00:06:06.265
- Take care.
- Okay.

00:06:08.295 --> 00:06:11.565
Hey, Mr. Park is so worried about Min Seo,
and you're... Seriously...

00:06:14.335 --> 00:06:15.505
It's Park Han Jun!

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:21.775
- How did you first meet Lee Woo Gyeom?
- What convinced you the cure was real?

00:06:21.845 --> 00:06:23.915
Did you have a contingency plan
for the demonstration's failure?

00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:25.845
Gosh, what do you think you're doing?

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:27.545
I'll hold them off.
You need to get out of here, fast.

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:28.945
Hold on, wait a minute.

00:06:29.015 --> 00:06:31.615
Hey, I'm the one who introduced
Mr. Park to Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:06:31.685 --> 00:06:33.355
- Head downstairs, quickly!
- Mr. Park!

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:34.885
- He called me back then, and...
- Mr. Park Han Jun!

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:37.095
- Just a moment!
- Hey, wait. Wait!

00:06:37.155 --> 00:06:39.225
- Just one comment, please!
- Mr. Park!

00:06:40.095 --> 00:06:43.395
- All right. I know you're curious, but...
- Step back. You can't film this.

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:47.065
Come on, let's discuss this over coffee.
We're all colleagues, for crying out loud!

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:49.675
(National Assembly Member's Office)

00:06:55.575 --> 00:06:57.145
What took you so long?

00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:14.565
Prosecutor Cha.
What's the status of the trial?

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:18.195
Now, talk of the death penalty
is completely off the table for a while.

00:07:18.935 --> 00:07:20.565
You'll just have to be patient.

00:07:22.035 --> 00:07:23.035
What was that?

00:07:23.405 --> 00:07:25.235
The trial isn't over yet.

00:07:28.345 --> 00:07:30.175
Are you playing word games with me?

00:07:31.345 --> 00:07:34.185
Public opinion has completely swung
in his favor.

00:07:35.015 --> 00:07:38.085
Even if he gets the death penalty,
this isn't a win for us anymore.

00:07:38.485 --> 00:07:40.055
I'm going to make this
a psychological battle.

00:07:41.825 --> 00:07:43.495
Lee Woo Gyeom may have succeeded
with his cure,

00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:46.425
but people are still afraid
of potential side effects.

00:07:46.495 --> 00:07:47.965
And that very fear...

00:07:48.695 --> 00:07:49.765
is what I'm going to exploit.

00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:53.705
So you have evidence to support that?

00:07:57.705 --> 00:08:01.105
Director Oh. May I be excused?

00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:02.875
I have a lot to prepare.

00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:07.985
- Sir...
- Fine, go! Just go!

00:08:08.545 --> 00:08:09.555
Go!

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:14.485
Prepare quickly and perfectly. Got it?

00:08:16.955 --> 00:08:18.395
And one more thing, Assemblyman.

00:08:21.595 --> 00:08:24.965
You keep saying, "We will win."
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

00:08:25.165 --> 00:08:26.865
So allow me to set the record straight.

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:29.535
Weren't we supposed to be
strategic allies?

00:08:30.035 --> 00:08:32.905
The one who wins this trial is me. Not us.

00:08:34.975 --> 00:08:36.845
You seem to be under a misconception.

00:08:37.445 --> 00:08:39.985
I work for the Public Prosecutors' Office
of the Republic of Korea.

00:08:40.485 --> 00:08:42.485
I am not your subordinate.

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:46.285
From now on,
if you have any questions for me,

00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:50.695
you are to come to my office. In person.

00:08:50.755 --> 00:08:54.525
You will request an appointment
that accommodates my schedule,

00:08:54.695 --> 00:08:56.635
and then you may ask.
I would appreciate that.

00:08:56.935 --> 00:08:59.305
Now then. The trial is imminent,
so if you'll excuse me.

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:04.705
What? What did she... What was that?

00:09:06.375 --> 00:09:08.875
Is she out of her mind? That...

00:09:09.545 --> 00:09:10.975
Who does she think she is?

00:09:14.315 --> 00:09:15.515
(Courthouse)

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.855
He's a serial killer
who brutally murdered 17 people,

00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:21.725
and the man who recently performed
a miraculous cure on a terminal patient.

00:09:21.785 --> 00:09:24.555
Today is the final hearing
in the trial of Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:09:25.095 --> 00:09:28.095
Experts remain sharply divided
on the matter.

00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:32.465
Therefore, the court's stance on where
the public's best interests lie...

00:09:32.535 --> 00:09:35.105
is expected to
heavily influence the verdict.

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:41.305
Meanwhile, massive crowds have gathered
in front of the courthouse.

00:09:41.545 --> 00:09:44.345
There are those calling for
Lee Woo Gyeom's immediate execution,

00:09:44.575 --> 00:09:48.145
facing off against a group
that worships him as a savior.

00:09:48.415 --> 00:09:52.055
Police have deployed large forces
to prepare for any potential incidents,

00:09:52.155 --> 00:09:54.485
and they are on high alert
for possible clashes.

00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:58.025
For now, the demonstrations are limited
to chanting and picket signs,

00:09:58.395 --> 00:10:01.525
but the tension at the scene
is growing by the minute.

00:10:15.045 --> 00:10:16.915
(Justice is blind, but Woo Gyeom is not.)

00:10:16.975 --> 00:10:18.815
(No one is above the law.)

00:10:24.985 --> 00:10:26.555
Reporter Jo, you're here.

00:10:28.025 --> 00:10:29.155
They haven't gone in yet, have they?

00:10:43.905 --> 00:10:44.905
Prosecutor.

00:10:45.475 --> 00:10:46.475
Proceed with your sentencing.

00:10:52.315 --> 00:10:53.615
A few days ago,

00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:58.055
I met with Lee Chang Se, who was rescued
at the scene of the defendant's arrest,

00:10:58.655 --> 00:11:02.485
and Song Tae Jin,
the defendant's sixth patient.

00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:11.965
Both men's health has rapidly worsened,
and their lives now hang in the balance.

00:11:13.165 --> 00:11:14.165
Your Honor.

00:11:14.765 --> 00:11:16.675
And yet, can we consider
the successful medical demonstration...

00:11:17.035 --> 00:11:20.645
as definitive proof
of the defendant's healing abilities?

00:11:21.405 --> 00:11:24.345
I submit that we must not only
re-examine the falsehoods...

00:11:24.545 --> 00:11:26.845
in the evidence, witness accounts,
and testimonies...

00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:30.015
concerning the defendant's cure,

00:11:30.985 --> 00:11:32.455
but I also ask this court...

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:35.255
to conduct a full review
of his alleged healing ability.

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:37.155
As in the original trial,

00:11:40.095 --> 00:11:41.325
the prosecution seeks the death penalty.

00:11:53.075 --> 00:11:55.675
Defense counsel.
Proceed with your closing argument.

00:12:06.485 --> 00:12:07.485
Counselor?

00:12:11.995 --> 00:12:12.995
I apologize.

00:12:18.835 --> 00:12:19.835
I...

00:12:21.405 --> 00:12:25.105
If the defendant's cure is a fraud,
as the prosecution claims,

00:12:25.205 --> 00:12:29.475
then I have no right
to make a closing argument here today.

00:12:36.185 --> 00:12:37.555
Your Honor.

00:12:39.555 --> 00:12:41.985
However, Mr. Song Tae Jin,

00:12:43.095 --> 00:12:44.755
unlike the other patients
who made a full recovery,

00:12:44.825 --> 00:12:47.425
did not believe in the effectiveness
of the defendant's treatment.

00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:49.165
No, I wasn't cured.

00:12:49.865 --> 00:12:51.195
I've started going back to the hospital.

00:12:52.165 --> 00:12:56.635
He was concurrently taking
other prescribed medications.

00:12:57.675 --> 00:12:58.875
The same goes for Lee Chang Se.

00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:03.175
Despite the defendant's repeated warnings
at the arrest scene, the police...

00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:06.145
forcibly transferred him to a hospital.

00:13:09.685 --> 00:13:11.885
If my treatment method
gets mixed with theirs,

00:13:12.155 --> 00:13:13.685
he will never recover.

00:13:13.985 --> 00:13:15.925
As a result, tragically,

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:20.625
he is now critical due to side effects
from the medication. But none of this...

00:13:21.665 --> 00:13:24.895
is a reason to deny
the defendant's ability to heal.

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:31.235
The prosecution continues
to ignore the truth,

00:13:32.205 --> 00:13:33.345
and I find that deeply regrettable.

00:13:36.005 --> 00:13:37.345
Your Honor.

00:13:38.475 --> 00:13:39.475
We all...

00:13:40.215 --> 00:13:45.155
bore witness to that moving moment,
that deeply moving moment,

00:13:45.815 --> 00:13:47.685
of the defendant curing a young patient.

00:13:49.055 --> 00:13:50.055
Some might say that,

00:13:51.655 --> 00:13:53.125
the child was cured...

00:13:54.425 --> 00:13:56.965
like a miracle in a fairy tale.

00:13:57.335 --> 00:14:00.965
But the defendant's cure is no fantasy,
no magic, and no miracle.

00:14:02.105 --> 00:14:03.475
For patients with incurable diseases...

00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:07.305
and their families,

00:14:08.645 --> 00:14:10.045
it's what they have
desperately dreamed of...

00:14:11.045 --> 00:14:12.045
made into reality.

00:14:14.945 --> 00:14:18.485
It is the undeniable fact
that gives them a new lease on life.

00:14:19.515 --> 00:14:20.755
Therefore, in this trial,

00:14:21.825 --> 00:14:22.825
I ask for a sentence that allows him...

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:26.025
to serve patients suffering
from incurable diseases,

00:14:26.565 --> 00:14:28.525
and in doing so, pay his debt to society.

00:14:29.325 --> 00:14:33.765
I sincerely ask the court
for a wise and just sentence.

00:14:35.535 --> 00:14:38.575
Finally, to respect and protect
human dignity and value...

00:14:38.835 --> 00:14:41.805
and the nobility of the human spirit,

00:14:42.375 --> 00:14:44.945
is the very reason
we are in this courtroom,

00:14:45.875 --> 00:14:47.545
and I believe it is the very essence
of the law.

00:14:50.585 --> 00:14:52.185
(Defendant)

00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:56.525
That is all.

00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:15.445
I will now deliver the sentence.

00:15:21.885 --> 00:15:26.725
The defendant is a brutal criminal
who took precious lives.

00:15:30.955 --> 00:15:32.425
However, the court...

00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:36.595
while watching a child get treatment
at the hands of the defendant...

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:38.395
grappled with a difficult question.

00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:43.175
Is condemning his hands the only true path
to justice?

00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:47.845
We also considered the possibility...

00:15:49.205 --> 00:15:52.415
that the number of lives
the defendant could save in the future...

00:15:52.475 --> 00:15:54.315
might exceed the number he has taken.

00:15:55.485 --> 00:15:56.685
Therefore, this court...

00:15:57.555 --> 00:15:59.355
has determined that for the defendant,
punishment...

00:15:59.785 --> 00:16:03.055
is to treat the sick
for the rest of his life...

00:16:03.455 --> 00:16:06.365
and thus make a positive contribution
to society.

00:16:06.795 --> 00:16:08.595
The court sentences him as follows.

00:16:11.465 --> 00:16:12.835
The defendant, Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:16:13.565 --> 00:16:15.765
shall serve his sentence
in a state-approved quarantine facility...

00:16:16.305 --> 00:16:20.375
by treating terminally ill patients.

00:16:21.675 --> 00:16:23.675
This is not an exemption from punishment.

00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:27.545
It means he must spend his entire life
atoning.

00:16:28.115 --> 00:16:29.815
If, for any reason,

00:16:30.315 --> 00:16:32.285
he refuses to perform these treatments,

00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:35.325
his original death sentence
will be reinstated.

00:16:35.655 --> 00:16:38.095
This is a conditional death sentence.

00:17:01.045 --> 00:17:02.885
- He's coming out.
- Prosecutor Cha!

00:17:02.885 --> 00:17:05.055
Prosecutor, do you respect
the court's decision?

00:17:05.115 --> 00:17:07.355
Prosecutor Cha, why do you think
you lost the case?

00:17:07.355 --> 00:17:08.855
Do you plan to file for a retrial?

00:17:08.925 --> 00:17:11.925
Some say this prosecution was a reach
from the start. Your thoughts?

00:17:11.995 --> 00:17:14.295
- Do you agree with the verdict?
- Please, just give us a comment.

00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:15.625
How are you feeling?

00:17:17.865 --> 00:17:19.495
- You murdering jerk!
- Kill him!

00:17:20.265 --> 00:17:21.535
Execute him!

00:17:35.645 --> 00:17:38.115
With the Supreme Court ruling in favor of
Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:17:38.255 --> 00:17:41.025
all eyes are now on his next move.

00:17:41.585 --> 00:17:46.525
He is to be held at Chaeum Medical Center,
a state-designated isolation facility,

00:17:46.765 --> 00:17:50.695
which is the largest medical research
and treatment complex...

00:17:50.865 --> 00:17:54.005
and is equipped with an elite medical team
and security force.

00:17:57.435 --> 00:18:02.045
Hello. I am Chae Jeong Su,
Chairman of the Chaeum Medical Group.

00:18:07.115 --> 00:18:10.355
What I wish to state today
on behalf of Chaeum...

00:18:10.815 --> 00:18:15.025
stems from a single desire
to make our society healthier.

00:18:15.885 --> 00:18:18.425
In light of the recent trial,
we at Chaeum Medical Group...

00:18:18.495 --> 00:18:21.165
will help Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom,
who received a conditional death sentence.

00:18:21.525 --> 00:18:24.395
We will donate a facility
so that he may focus on treating patients.

00:18:24.635 --> 00:18:28.535
And we pledge our unconditional support
for this endeavor.

00:18:28.605 --> 00:18:29.665
(National Assembly Member's Office)

00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:33.175
The debate over Lee Woo Gyeom is spreading
throughout the political sphere.

00:18:33.345 --> 00:18:37.575
While the government respects the ruling
as one considering public interest,

00:18:37.645 --> 00:18:40.515
the controversy over the legitimacy
of this new system...

00:18:40.785 --> 00:18:44.515
shows no signs of dying down.

00:18:45.355 --> 00:18:47.855
It's bad enough we're letting a murderer
off the hook.

00:18:48.185 --> 00:18:50.695
- Now we have to build him a sanctuary?
- You heard the verdict.

00:18:53.625 --> 00:18:54.825
What's the Ministry of Justice's
take on this?

00:18:55.165 --> 00:18:58.095
We intend to respect
the honorable members' opinions.

00:18:59.165 --> 00:19:03.205
This is for the good of the people anyway.
Let's just push it through.

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:07.205
Protecting a murderer?
How is that for the public good?

00:19:07.905 --> 00:19:11.345
It's already been decided.
Let's not fight amongst ourselves.

00:19:11.645 --> 00:19:14.285
For now, let's just discuss
how to select the patients.

00:19:14.345 --> 00:19:15.785
Still, it only seems right
that the first treatment...

00:19:15.785 --> 00:19:17.615
goes to the lawyer Park's daughter.

00:19:18.085 --> 00:19:19.485
It's only right, don't you think?

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:22.825
The lawyer's daughter...

00:19:25.355 --> 00:19:26.355
Unbelievable.

00:19:27.125 --> 00:19:29.725
(Guam district prosecutors' office)

00:19:30.195 --> 00:19:32.165
This is tough, isn't it?

00:19:33.505 --> 00:19:35.335
No matter how I look at it, it's a mess.

00:19:37.635 --> 00:19:39.075
I'm talking about you, Prosecutor Cha.

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:41.705
Why do you have to make things
so complicated?

00:19:43.175 --> 00:19:44.175
I'm sorry, sir.

00:19:44.915 --> 00:19:47.785
You know I'm not one
to fixate on the outcome, right?

00:19:48.615 --> 00:19:50.655
But you handled this with such arrogance.

00:19:51.355 --> 00:19:52.615
Do you think at my age...

00:19:53.155 --> 00:19:55.585
Do you really think I enjoy
sucking up to Assemblyman Baek?

00:19:56.285 --> 00:19:58.025
There are still unresolved cases
related to Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:19:58.095 --> 00:19:59.895
You're being transferred
to Namhae next month.

00:20:00.565 --> 00:20:01.565
What?

00:20:02.065 --> 00:20:03.235
Why the surprise?

00:20:03.565 --> 00:20:06.235
A serial killer gets to have
a bright future,

00:20:06.835 --> 00:20:08.735
so you think the prosecutor in charge
gets off scot-free?

00:20:16.975 --> 00:20:18.115
One hundred twenty-nine.

00:20:19.345 --> 00:20:20.745
One hundred thirty.

00:20:20.745 --> 00:20:21.915
Two hundred ninety-eight.

00:20:23.615 --> 00:20:24.785
Shoulder throw!

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:30.125
Liver, liver! Heart, heart!

00:20:41.805 --> 00:20:43.335
Hey, Min Gyeong.

00:20:43.705 --> 00:20:44.835
What are you doing, Reporter Jo?

00:20:45.375 --> 00:20:48.505
- What do you mean?
- That. How long have you been doing this?

00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:51.645
Ever since I started at the Daehan Ilbo.

00:20:52.575 --> 00:20:55.545
- Man, that's already been 20 years.
- Gosh! That's incredible!

00:20:55.945 --> 00:20:58.885
It's nothing special, just something I do.
I just try to be consistent.

00:20:59.385 --> 00:21:00.985
So why are you so dedicated to it?

00:21:01.725 --> 00:21:02.885
So I can write my articles.

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:08.125
- What?
- Sound writing comes from a sound body.

00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:13.135
You should give it a try.
Learning this could really come in handy.

00:21:14.435 --> 00:21:16.265
Let's get you warmed up first
so you don't get hurt.

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:28.045
Gosh, that was so cool!

00:21:28.445 --> 00:21:30.055
- How was that?
- Yes.

00:21:30.285 --> 00:21:31.285
One more time?

00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:32.985
Feel better now?

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.585
I'd say "not yet."

00:21:36.325 --> 00:21:37.855
I still haven't been able
to treat the patients.

00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:39.455
In that case,

00:21:40.125 --> 00:21:41.795
I've got some good news for you.

00:21:42.865 --> 00:21:46.535
You remember Chaeum Medical Group,
where you entered the cure contest?

00:21:47.205 --> 00:21:48.205
What about them?

00:21:48.305 --> 00:21:52.205
They donated a facility
so you can treat the patients.

00:21:52.805 --> 00:21:53.805
They did?

00:21:54.945 --> 00:21:58.015
They say you should treat the patients
in a good environment.

00:21:58.275 --> 00:21:59.315
That's the gist of it.

00:21:59.575 --> 00:22:00.585
Still,

00:22:01.185 --> 00:22:02.845
Min Seo has to get treated first.

00:22:04.215 --> 00:22:06.925
We've been through a lot together,

00:22:07.185 --> 00:22:09.255
but I'm not the kind of person
who forgets that.

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:13.425
After all, you were the only one
who believed in me...

00:22:14.065 --> 00:22:15.165
from the beginning.

00:22:18.735 --> 00:22:19.735

They donated a facility
so you could treat the patients.

00:22:46.295 --> 00:22:50.495
Your Honor, this is the cure research
Lee Woo Gyeom sent to the contest.

00:22:52.365 --> 00:22:56.265
At the time, his idea was highly praised
by Chaeum's research team,

00:22:56.335 --> 00:23:00.035
and we've confirmed that
they were even in talks to develop it.

00:23:02.545 --> 00:23:03.875
Right, right.

00:23:05.245 --> 00:23:07.185
- Good to see you, sir.
- That crazy...

00:23:13.315 --> 00:23:16.325
Hey! Why are you bowing to the jerk
who stabbed you?

00:23:27.965 --> 00:23:29.335

Aren't you getting a little
ahead of yourself?

00:23:43.715 --> 00:23:47.425
What was the rush?
Why donate that facility already?

00:23:48.755 --> 00:23:52.095
- Because it's what the times demand.
- Chairman Chae.

00:23:52.625 --> 00:23:56.465
It's like you're just handing the world
over to a murderer.

Whether he's a murderer or a savior
is for the world to decide, isn't it?

What? "Old man?"

If you keep frowning like that,
you'll get wrinkles.

Whether Lee Woo Gyeom is convicted or not,

00:24:50.485 --> 00:24:53.555
all you care about is getting reelected,
isn't it?

00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:57.655
The seat we've helped you keep
since my father's time...

00:25:00.725 --> 00:25:04.295
It would be a lonely, empty life
without it, wouldn't it?

than hate, and money is more important...

than power.

leave Lee Woo Gyeom alone...

00:27:02.245 --> 00:27:05.315
In return, he promised that
he'd let Min Seo jump the line...

00:27:05.985 --> 00:27:10.355
and get her treated off the record.

00:27:13.895 --> 00:27:15.625
What are you even hesitating for?

00:27:16.695 --> 00:27:19.265
Right now, it's a lottery
for who gets to live or die!

00:27:19.665 --> 00:27:24.275
Then why did you even take his case?
Look at our situation! Look at Min Seo!

00:27:24.775 --> 00:27:26.805
Every second counts for Min Seo!

00:27:27.805 --> 00:27:28.875
Goodness, what are we going to do?

00:27:43.085 --> 00:27:44.095
Han Jun.

00:27:44.795 --> 00:27:48.225
Lee Woo Gyeom is the only person
on earth who can save her now.

00:27:48.565 --> 00:27:50.595
Don't you want to save our daughter? No?

00:27:58.135 --> 00:27:59.335
Dad.

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:05.375
Daddy.

00:28:09.845 --> 00:28:12.185
Hey, Min Seo. You're awake.

00:28:14.585 --> 00:28:15.655
Dad.

00:28:17.155 --> 00:28:18.955
Yes. You want some water?

00:28:21.165 --> 00:28:22.265
Dad.

00:28:24.095 --> 00:28:25.465
Where are you?

00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:30.535
I...

00:28:31.735 --> 00:28:32.735
My eyes...

00:28:33.705 --> 00:28:35.475
They won't open.

00:28:41.945 --> 00:28:42.945
Min Seo.

00:28:44.615 --> 00:28:48.085
Dad. I'm scared.

00:28:52.555 --> 00:28:53.555
Dad.

00:28:53.995 --> 00:28:54.995
Look at me.

00:28:57.235 --> 00:28:58.635
You really can't see me?

00:29:00.195 --> 00:29:04.735
No. I can't see you.

00:29:08.945 --> 00:29:10.175
Daddy...

00:29:18.255 --> 00:29:19.285
Dad!

00:29:22.025 --> 00:29:23.025
Doctor!

00:29:34.965 --> 00:29:35.965
Here, drink up.

00:29:37.505 --> 00:29:40.275
Isn't this a little cheap
for a farewell gift?

00:29:41.175 --> 00:29:43.205
It's to energize you for work.

00:29:44.575 --> 00:29:46.645
Work on what? The trial's over.

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:48.515
You remember the look...

00:29:48.685 --> 00:29:50.115
on Prosecutor Cha's face
when the verdict was read?

00:29:50.755 --> 00:29:51.955
How could I forget?

00:29:52.285 --> 00:29:55.085
She looked like she wanted
to murder our boss.

00:29:56.085 --> 00:29:59.495
Knowing her, she's collecting evidence
to overturn the Supreme Court's ruling...

00:29:59.555 --> 00:30:00.865
and will file for a retrial
immediately, I bet.

00:30:03.365 --> 00:30:04.495
Besides, let's be honest.

00:30:04.965 --> 00:30:07.735
Lee Woo Gyeom only just dodged
the death penalty.

00:30:08.335 --> 00:30:10.635
And his relationship with Professor Han
is still a little murky.

00:30:11.075 --> 00:30:16.045
And they still haven't found the killer
of Song Min Su, Professor Han's colleague.

00:30:17.315 --> 00:30:20.585
And another thing,
what about all that money...

00:30:20.945 --> 00:30:22.645
that Chaeum Medical Group
is suddenly giving...

00:30:22.885 --> 00:30:25.415
to support Lee Woo Gyeom?
Don't you think that's weird?

00:30:25.615 --> 00:30:28.025
That's where Professor Han and Song Min Su
used to work together.

00:30:29.085 --> 00:30:32.495
You're right. It's pretty weird,
almost as weird as you.

00:30:33.155 --> 00:30:37.595
My dear Min Jung is
such a bad judge of character. My gosh.

00:30:38.965 --> 00:30:42.965
My judgment's better than someone's memory
who's gotten my name wrong 12 times.

00:30:43.035 --> 00:30:46.105
Goodness. You kept count? Twelve times?

00:30:46.835 --> 00:30:49.475
Smart and spunky Min Jung.

00:30:49.845 --> 00:30:52.315
You're ready to get back to work.

00:30:54.115 --> 00:30:57.145
And that's why
I've prepared a little something.

00:30:57.555 --> 00:31:00.515
Ta-da!

00:31:02.025 --> 00:31:04.325
Let's work together on a special feature
about Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:31:04.795 --> 00:31:08.095
His entire life story, from birth to now.

00:31:09.195 --> 00:31:13.905
I figure it's the perfect way to clear up
all the mysteries surrounding him, right?

00:31:15.435 --> 00:31:18.105
This will rake in a ton of ad money.

00:31:18.575 --> 00:31:21.075
And I'll give you a cut.

00:31:23.345 --> 00:31:26.715
If you don't want to, you can just go back
to the press club and keep making copies.

00:31:26.875 --> 00:31:29.545
No, that's not what I meant.

00:31:30.445 --> 00:31:32.015
So what's the split?

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.455
The split...
I haven't really thought about it.

00:31:36.725 --> 00:31:37.725
Ninety-ten?

00:31:38.695 --> 00:31:39.855
Take your coffee back.

00:31:39.925 --> 00:31:43.825
Gosh, so it's all about the money, right?
Fine. Eighty-twenty. No, seventy-thirty.

00:31:43.895 --> 00:31:45.135
Seventy-thirty sounds fair, doesn't it?

00:31:45.495 --> 00:31:48.605
- It is a perfectly fair split.
- A little higher.

00:31:48.965 --> 00:31:50.775
- Fifty-fifty?
- Fifty-fifty. You got a deal!

00:31:50.835 --> 00:31:52.875
Deal! All right, look.

00:31:52.935 --> 00:31:54.075
(The Prosecution)

00:31:55.675 --> 00:31:59.275
(Attorney Cha Yi Yeon)

00:32:05.185 --> 00:32:06.585
(Notice of case disposition)

00:32:07.385 --> 00:32:08.855
Professor Han Sang Ho.

00:32:09.525 --> 00:32:14.195
Due to illegal human experiments
conducted without the victims' consent...

00:32:15.195 --> 00:32:18.195
led to a chain of victims.

00:32:18.665 --> 00:32:23.565
Are you also aware that Professor Han
used Lee Woo Gyeom as a test subject?

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:36.285
The ones who cleared Professor Han
of all charges...

00:32:36.985 --> 00:32:39.255
They are Director Oh Hyeon Deuk
and Assemblyman Baek Sang Hwa.

00:32:39.315 --> 00:32:40.725
(Oh Hyeon Deuk, Baek Sang Hwa)

00:32:41.025 --> 00:32:42.785
Before you found out, Prosecutor...

00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:48.325
What's important is that someone already
handled everything with Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:32:48.965 --> 00:32:52.835
If there's someone
pulling the strings behind them,

00:32:53.465 --> 00:32:56.335
- that would mean...
- If you dig too deep,

00:32:56.835 --> 00:33:01.275
- you could get hurt, Prosecutor.
- Who could it be?

00:33:02.075 --> 00:33:03.075
Prosecutor Cha.

00:33:05.315 --> 00:33:06.345
Prosecutor Cha.

00:33:09.385 --> 00:33:10.985
We'll be on our way.

00:33:13.885 --> 00:33:15.525
Where are you being transferred to?

00:33:16.325 --> 00:33:20.695
For now, I'll work for Prosecutor Lee
in the Acting Prosecutor's Office.

00:33:22.225 --> 00:33:24.635
Thank you both for all your hard work.

00:33:29.565 --> 00:33:30.975
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:33:37.745 --> 00:33:38.745
Prosecutor Cha.

00:33:39.975 --> 00:33:43.445
If you look at the bottom of
Professor Han Sang Ho's file,

00:33:43.715 --> 00:33:45.955
I've organized some additional information
I found.

00:33:46.755 --> 00:33:47.755
Thank you.

00:33:48.325 --> 00:33:50.085
Stay in touch, Prosecutor Cha.

00:33:51.995 --> 00:33:53.225
Thank you for your hard work.

00:33:58.995 --> 00:33:59.995
Okay.

00:34:17.515 --> 00:34:18.515
What is it now?

00:34:19.255 --> 00:34:20.515
You still have more to say?

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:24.155
You know that Professor Han Sang Ho is
connected to Lee Woo Gyeom, don't you?

00:34:24.925 --> 00:34:26.495
Tell me what you know.

00:34:29.325 --> 00:34:30.365
Know when to quit.

00:34:31.235 --> 00:34:33.035
Tell me what your relationship
with him was.

00:34:35.505 --> 00:34:37.235
Does your father know
you're acting this way?

00:34:38.435 --> 00:34:39.605
The trial is over,

00:34:40.205 --> 00:34:41.405
so why are you still dredging this up?

00:34:41.975 --> 00:34:45.715
Don't even think about a retrial.
Just lay low for a month, then disappear.

00:34:46.845 --> 00:34:47.845
This is your last warning.

00:35:03.225 --> 00:35:05.465
It seems Prosecutor Cha
is on Professor Han's trail as well.

00:35:09.335 --> 00:35:11.005
And where is Professor Han now?

00:35:12.435 --> 00:35:13.575
We're still looking for him.

00:35:24.115 --> 00:35:25.485
"We're still looking for him?"

00:35:31.125 --> 00:35:33.395
I don't want, "We're looking for him."
I want to hear, "We've found him."

00:35:34.225 --> 00:35:36.695
That's what you should be reporting to me.

00:35:37.935 --> 00:35:38.935
I apologize.

00:35:41.605 --> 00:35:44.535
I need you to bring me answers,
not more problems.

00:35:44.935 --> 00:35:46.875
Even as we speak,
because of incurable diseases,

00:35:46.875 --> 00:35:49.505
countless patients are tragically dying,
aren't they?

00:35:50.645 --> 00:35:51.715
Director Ahn.

00:35:55.845 --> 00:35:57.885
For the sake of the patients
and their families,

00:35:57.955 --> 00:36:01.385
don't you think we need to succeed
in developing this cure quickly?

00:36:02.825 --> 00:36:04.195
Yes, you're right, sir.

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:05.925
Please hurry.

00:36:07.195 --> 00:36:08.195
Yes, sir.

00:36:15.335 --> 00:36:16.335
Right.

00:36:18.275 --> 00:36:20.235
He doesn't need to be breathing, does he?

00:36:21.105 --> 00:36:23.875
- Sir?
- I'm talking about Professor Han.

00:36:26.845 --> 00:36:28.515
Yes, I understand.

00:36:42.325 --> 00:36:45.565
(Chelsea Hotel)

00:38:08.015 --> 00:38:09.385
In the new drug development project,

00:38:09.985 --> 00:38:12.555
isn't two-percent for Assemblyman Baek
a little excessive?

00:38:16.525 --> 00:38:19.125
Assemblyman Baek also saw Lee Woo Gyeom
as a thorn in his side.

00:38:19.425 --> 00:38:21.195
Just consider it an investment
in the future.

00:38:22.925 --> 00:38:23.925
Are you sure about this?

00:38:24.595 --> 00:38:27.295
He was on TV last time,
shooting his mouth off.

00:38:28.165 --> 00:38:31.335
I think we should've taken this chance
to replace him with some new blood.

00:38:33.535 --> 00:38:34.605
Don't worry.

00:38:35.005 --> 00:38:37.475
You've never lost money on Chaeum,
have you?

00:38:37.975 --> 00:38:41.115
Did you forget the plan was to launch
the new drug last year?

00:38:41.745 --> 00:38:44.485
You're the one who broke your promise
in the first place.

00:38:45.385 --> 00:38:47.055
But with Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:38:47.055 --> 00:38:49.185
it's just a matter of time
until the treatment is ready.

00:38:49.525 --> 00:38:52.195
- We can discuss Mr. Baek's seat later...
- Chairman Chae.

00:38:53.755 --> 00:38:57.735
Don't tell me this is happening
because you got involved with Mr. Baek.

00:38:58.595 --> 00:38:59.595
Excuse me?

00:39:02.365 --> 00:39:03.605
Me, get involved with someone?

00:39:09.545 --> 00:39:10.705
Who are you suggesting?

00:39:11.375 --> 00:39:12.445
Madam Chairman.

00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:17.545
You have to feed the dog
if you want it to hunt.

00:39:18.755 --> 00:39:20.885
I am his master, after all.
So how could I...

00:39:22.225 --> 00:39:23.625
let him starve to death?

00:39:30.895 --> 00:39:32.565
Everyone, let's stop
with the pointless worrying...

00:39:33.495 --> 00:39:35.365
and focus on what's important.

00:39:36.835 --> 00:39:37.835
Got it?

00:39:58.255 --> 00:39:59.455
- It's Park Han Jun!
- It's Park Han Jun!

00:40:01.055 --> 00:40:03.695
Mr. Park, what's your reaction
to the verdict?

00:40:05.235 --> 00:40:07.565
- Sorry.
- Still in contact with Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:10.235
Is it true you only defended him
to get treatment for your daughter?

00:40:11.135 --> 00:40:12.535
Ladies and gentlemen of the press.

00:40:13.875 --> 00:40:16.075
We declined an interview,
so if you report on this...

00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:19.445
You're aware you'll be sued for
invasion of privacy, right?

00:40:22.915 --> 00:40:23.915
The Namhae Prosecutor's Office?

00:40:26.855 --> 00:40:28.155
You're headed somewhere
with nice country air. I see.

00:40:28.785 --> 00:40:29.925
You think this is funny?

00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:32.395
And whose fault do you think that is?

00:40:32.895 --> 00:40:36.225
That's why I told you
not to trust Chief Oh.

00:40:36.525 --> 00:40:38.135
I never trusted him.

00:40:40.735 --> 00:40:43.305
In what world does an employee
get to choose their boss?

00:40:45.575 --> 00:40:46.575
Nowhere.

00:40:50.405 --> 00:40:51.775
Are you kidding me right now?

00:40:56.385 --> 00:40:58.015
Look, you know Professor Han Sang Ho,
right?

00:40:59.215 --> 00:41:02.325
I'm Lee Woo Gyeom's lawyer.
Of course I know him.

00:41:03.385 --> 00:41:06.955
There's a past case that connects
Professor Han to Chief Oh,

00:41:07.725 --> 00:41:08.765
and something's off about it.

00:41:09.425 --> 00:41:11.995
And why are you telling me this now?

00:41:12.835 --> 00:41:14.805
Are you blowing me off
now that the trial is over?

00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:18.205
Look, I'm a lawyer, not a detective.

00:41:22.545 --> 00:41:26.675
Then what if Lee Woo Gyeom
is involved in this case too?

(Announces Patient Selection by Lottery)

00:41:52.575 --> 00:41:54.375
They're selecting patients by lottery?

00:41:54.705 --> 00:41:58.145
What? Does that even make sense?
Imagine how many people will apply.

00:41:58.415 --> 00:42:00.815
- They mean Lee Woo Gyeom, right?
- Looks like it.

(Jinnam Medical Research Institute)

00:42:16.525 --> 00:42:21.235
Illegal human experiments conducted
without the subjects' consent...

00:42:22.235 --> 00:42:25.435
resulted in a series of adverse events.

00:42:25.835 --> 00:42:28.205
(Lottery Selection and Treatment Support:
Chaeum Medical Center)

00:42:34.545 --> 00:42:37.085

It's a pleasure to finally meet you.
Prosecutor Cha Yi Yeon.

00:44:38.005 --> 00:44:39.005
Have you been well?

00:44:49.585 --> 00:44:51.985
Administer a little more medication.

00:44:52.685 --> 00:44:53.685
Vitals are...

00:44:58.555 --> 00:45:00.255
The vitals are irregular.

00:45:05.465 --> 00:45:08.935
Professor Han Sang Ho?
Yes, of course I know him.

00:45:09.565 --> 00:45:14.105
My father, the former chairman,
personally recruited him back in 2015.

00:45:14.175 --> 00:45:18.545
They worked together until 2023,
when he resigned for personal reasons.

00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:20.115
By your father, you mean...

00:45:20.615 --> 00:45:25.285
- the renowned expert on stem cells...
- Yes. That's Professor Chae Jeong Hun.

00:45:26.385 --> 00:45:28.285
He and Professor Han were friends,

00:45:28.455 --> 00:45:31.755
and the two of them devoted themselves
to studying incurable diseases at Chaeum.

00:45:38.395 --> 00:45:40.365
Mr. Ahn.

00:45:41.435 --> 00:45:42.865
I'm sorry, but could you give us a moment?

00:45:52.145 --> 00:45:53.145
How have you been?

00:45:55.515 --> 00:45:57.315
Just a bit boring, that's all.

00:46:01.115 --> 00:46:02.455
Everything's ready to go, right?

(Intensive Care Unit)

00:46:29.685 --> 00:46:31.315
Now the seizures will get more frequent,

00:46:32.985 --> 00:46:34.315
and dementia will start to set in.

00:46:35.025 --> 00:46:38.295
As the symptoms progress,
her life expectancy will shorten.

00:46:39.355 --> 00:46:42.525
I think it's best to prepare yourselves.

00:46:45.765 --> 00:46:48.035

Min Seo.

00:47:12.525 --> 00:47:16.125
You're curious about the malpractice case
involving Professor Han, aren't you?

00:47:20.695 --> 00:47:23.165
You're on official business.
Please, ask any questions, Prosecutor.

00:47:25.805 --> 00:47:28.705
Since you're being so cooperative
about a closed case,

00:47:29.345 --> 00:47:31.045
I'll be frank with you.

00:47:32.645 --> 00:47:35.345
The charges were dropped
due to a lack of evidence,

00:47:35.885 --> 00:47:38.785
but is it true that
Professor Han Sang Ho...

00:47:39.515 --> 00:47:40.985
conducted human experiments
without subjects' consent...

00:47:41.755 --> 00:47:44.585
at the Chaeum Medical Research Center?
