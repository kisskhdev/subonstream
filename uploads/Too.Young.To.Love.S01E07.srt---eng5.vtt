[Too Young To Love]

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.350
[Episode 7]

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.120
I'm so happy!

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.560
How...

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.960
How...

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.560
How did you convince your dad?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.070
With Shan's help, of course!

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.110
Shan not only got me a cello instructor,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.400
but also persuaded my dad.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.920
How very nice of him.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.560
Based on your account of him,

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.759
Shan is indeed the best

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.490
older friend one could ask for.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.640
You must improve

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.400
your academic grades during this period.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.640
Or you might miss out on your dream school

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:01.640
due to low scores.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.040
That'll let Shan down.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.350
I checked the cutoff score
for Hailan University.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.480
It is pretty high.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.790
I'm counting on you to improve

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.590
my grades on academic subjects.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.870
Me?

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.360
Don't you need to practice the cello
at Shan's place?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.240
I think...

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.910
during your cello practice there,

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.370
you can have him tutor you.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.680
But it's been many years
since Shan took the college entrance exam.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.940
He must've forgotten everything by now.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.630
I guess so.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.430
Then what about your best friend

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.360
Luo Ningzi?

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.630
Why not turn to her?

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.190
Ning could be helpful.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.460
I can really ask Ning for help!

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.870
How did that slip my mind?

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.980
But as I recall,

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.800
she lives pretty far away from your home.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.630
Won't that cause inconvenience?

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.280
It won't be a problem.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.740
She can tutor me at school.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.910
No.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.870
Look,

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.080
it'll be late by the time you get home
after the tutoring.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.680
Uncle Dong will get worried.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.840
So, you should

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.690
still be tutored by me.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.150
First, you said no to helping me.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.910
Then, you offered to tutor me.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.630
What exactly is your decision?

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.840
Will you... accept my help or not?

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.000
Fine, fine, fine.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.360
Please be my tutor,

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.590
my best friend.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.260
You finally realize
who your best friend is.

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.170
Stop laughing.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.840
I'm not laughing.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.840
Stop it now!

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.240
Knock it off, or I will...

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.400
Yi Lan!

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.240
Stay back!

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.150
Hurry up.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.310
I've been waiting forever.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.750
My dream is to marry my idol.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:52.210
A seven!

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.780
I've got this! My turn!

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.210
An eight.

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.430
I wish I could be a traveling cellist.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.750
And my wish...

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.280
is very simple.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.280
All I want is to be with the person I love
for ever and ever.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.840
"For ever and ever," huh?

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.190
Ning, what's your wish?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.190
To be the principal cellist
in a top orchestra.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.560
A flush.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:20.480
You'll pass, right?

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.940
A joker.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:21.829
Still pass, huh?

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.360
A bomb.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.380
All out.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.490
How could we let him win?

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.070
-Just admit defeat.
-We lost again.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.000
Where are the paper strips?

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.580
There are many on your faces.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.180
Change the punishment then.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.290
Your face...

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.240
already has many strips stuck on.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.480
I can only flick your forehead.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.210
Do be gentle.

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.580
Luo Ningzi.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.720
Dad, I'm home!

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.800
You're back, Lan.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.660
Wash your hands. Dinner's ready.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.240
I'm serving

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.840
your favorite dishes today.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.310
Dad, aren't you just amazing?

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.510
You're really the best dad in the world.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.870
What got into you today?

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.130
You're being so sweet.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.630
Dad.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.920
I'm all grown up now.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.680
If you have anything to say to me,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:20.680
just be frank and speak up.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.680
I'll understand.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.780
Anyway, no matter what you do,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:25.070
I know you love me.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.560
Seems like my daughter
has really grown up.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.430
Lecturing your own dad, huh?

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.730
[Class 9, Grade 12]

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.870
Yi Lan.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.560
Well...

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.130
I'm Chen Zhihan from Class 1, Grade 12.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.020
It's okay if you don't know me.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.930
This is for you.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:03.560
For me?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.120
Thank you.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.680
Well,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.850
are you close with Tong Xiaole?

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:12.480
Yes.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.070
Please pass this letter on to him.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.560
I got it.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.560
Thank you.

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.070
I only prepared one cup today.

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:28.870
But I'll buy you yours next time.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.360
Do deliver it.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.420
It's in good hands.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:34.000
Who is she?

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.560
A fan of Xiaole's.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.920
She seems... to be a good match for him.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.800
Dear friends,

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.200
I'll soon be off for specialized training.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.200
You might not get to see me at school.

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:52.390
Don't miss me too much!

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.610
Zhao Zhenghao,
are you going to study abroad as well?

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.680
Abroad? No.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.600
Domestic universities
are obviously better.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.360
Luo Ningzi!

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.020
When are you going abroad?

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.390
I'm still preparing.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:08.000
What?

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.800
She said she was still preparing.

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:14.890
Since everyone's around,

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:16.240
how about a gathering this weekend?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.700
I have an important issue.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.510
Sure.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.480
Eyes on me!

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.920
Look at her.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.580
Eyes on her.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:36.680
Okay, okay.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.310
You are gathered here today

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:39.510
to help me buy a ticket

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.040
to my idol's concert.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:42.870
Now,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.590
the most important thing

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.340
is to test the internet speed.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:47.480
Get your phones out.

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.210
Have a check.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.870
Clear all

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.870
background apps.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.630
Nice internet speed.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.450
Cleared.

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:53.360
Cleared.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.190
Good.

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:55.240
Then,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.110
when I count down from ten,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:59.000
you will open this page

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.360
and tap the button like crazy

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.000
as the tickets are available for purchase.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.870
Click non-stop.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.630
I thought it was an important matter
in life.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:06.680
As it turns out, you're just

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.240
wasting your life on trifles.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.170
What do you know?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.240
Your idol's not even as handsome as I am.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.560
-Mengmeng, why don't you...
-Zhao Zhenghao!

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.430
How dare you speak ill of my idol!

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.690
Sorry. I was wrong.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.630
Qiao Mengmeng,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.800
it'll be time soon.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.240
Don't blame us

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.640
if you can't get a ticket.

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:22.650
You're off the hook for now!

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.860
Alright. Open the page.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.550
Opened.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.260
The countdown starts.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.750
Five.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.390
Four.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200
-Three.
-Three.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:35.440
-Two.
-Two.

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:36.669
-One.
-One.

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:37.360
Click it!

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.039
Has anyone secured a ticket?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.300
How is that even possible?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.200
The page's not responding.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.390
I'm still trying.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:55.960
It's frozen.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.020
The checkout page!

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.510
I'll pay for it with your money.

00:08:58.510 --> 00:08:59.510
It's processing.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:02.200
Great.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.790
Why is it so slow?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.400
Is the reception bad?

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:09.640
Try it on the balcony.

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.600
Is it worth this much trouble?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.630
My goodness.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.200
He's really not handsome.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:22.300
Mengmeng, did you get the ticket?

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:27.240
What's wrong?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.910
Please don't cry.

00:09:28.910 --> 00:09:30.320
-Mengmeng.

All is fine.

There will be a solution.

Don't cry.

-This is not your idol's only concert.
-You're really crying?

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.980
Your idol will hold another concert.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.740
You can go to that one.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:45.720
Do you know any other way

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.910
to get a ticket?

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.440
How about we buy from a scalper?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.360
Yes, a scalper!

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.080
Right!

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.200
I happen to have a contact,

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.320
but he requires face-to-face transaction.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:54.720
That's okay.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.150
I'll pay for you first, alright?

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.840
Let me see.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.790
Scalped tickets are expensive.

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:01.080
Why should we buy any?

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.780

Yes.

00:10:37.410 --> 00:10:38.440
It was hard to snag such a ticket.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.120

How could I have made so many mistakes?

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.080
This angle is 45 degrees.

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:02.320
Look carefully.

00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:06.840
Why are math problems so difficult?

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.200
Why is my brain so slow?

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.360
Why hit your head?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.770
What if you really knock yourself stupid?

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:18.600
Hello?

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:20.720

I'm going to get the takeout.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.960
Stop hitting your head.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.420
It might take a toll on you.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.200
Why set an alarm

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.280
in broad daylight?

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:39.410
What are you looking at?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.920
You folded my wishes into paper cranes?

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.870
Who says they are yours?

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.270
Not mine?

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.680
Then you must've imitated me

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:54.180
and written your wishes on paper.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.630
However...

00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:58.670
paper cranes are usually girl stuff.

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.030
Do you...

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.430
have a crush on some girl?

00:13:06.510 --> 00:13:07.080

Cut it out.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.670
Some things are better said in person.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:12.790
Why write a letter?

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.080
Girls always find it embarrassing

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.810
to confess their love for boys.

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:19.240

Read the letter and you'll know.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.960
If I determine it to be badly written,

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.760
I may have a negative impression

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.440
of this girl.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.570
She wrote it with all her heart.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.320
You should at least read it.

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:46.600
Fine.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.910
Be quick.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.080
I hope you won't regret it.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.840

Why not consider giving her a chance?

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:09.360
No way.

Leave it there. I'll pack it myself.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.720
I need that pen for later.

It's not done yet.

Y-Y-You...

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.790

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:44.590

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:49.570
Better keep your word.

The ticket I sold her was absolutely real.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720
She just lost it,

00:17:58.720 --> 00:17:59.790
and somehow got a fake one.

quite a lot of money.

Don't...

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.410
Don't hurt me...

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:33.240

I've decided.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.830
I'll apply for a school of communications,

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.110
so I can be my idol's agent

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:31.840
and make him famous worldwide.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.410
I have faith in you.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.080

to apply for?

Yes, Hailan University.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.980
Hailan University...

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.560
Its computer science...

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:24.720
and business management
are top-tier programs.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:27.720
will you choose?

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:30.270
As for the major,

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:30.720
I...

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.400
haven't decided yet.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.010
Xiaole,

00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.160
I understand

00:22:38.790 --> 00:22:39.960
that your father

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.490
is a bit too strict with you.

00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:42.270
That said,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.770
you should really listen to

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.530
your inner voice when you pick a major.

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:48.750
I mean,

00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:49.810
follow your heart.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.590
I'm saying that

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:51.960
because with a major

00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.350
that you really like,

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:56.120
at least you'll be happy
in your future life

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:58.070
and studies.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.750
That's what I'd love to see.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.210

00:23:04.270 --> 00:23:05.470
photography, right?

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:08.890
It's actually quite a good major.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.270
If you're interested,

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:11.790
I can introduce you to some...

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:12.400
Bu,

00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:14.310
don't meddle with this.

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:15.570
I'll take my leave now.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.600

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.550
What now?

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:25.830
The principal pressured you again?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:27.830
The acceptance rate

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.640

in recent two years.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.770

That boy Tong Xiaole from my class

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:35.160
is a top ten student in the province.

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:37.030
The principal's eyes are on him every day.

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.630
How can I not feel pressured?

00:23:38.790 --> 00:23:39.720
Have you heard?

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:41.160
The dean's office

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.760
is discussing re-classing.

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:46.070
I don't think you'll be able
to manage Xiaole soon.

We can work around your schedule.

00:25:22.310 --> 00:25:23.200
In fact,

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:26.350
I've been your fan for quite some time.

00:25:26.350 --> 00:25:28.270
I didn't expect you to be so young.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.510
I really love the feeling

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.110
that your photos convey,

00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.550
especially the one in your pinned post.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.710
Is that your girlfriend?

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.350
No, no.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:40.160
She's not.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:47.270
How about this?

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.000
Send me the photo,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.790
and I will...

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.110
think about it.

00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.790
Okay.

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:54.330
I'll wait to hear from you.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.080
What are you looking at?

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:20.000
Come on.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.790
I bought you cake.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:22.960
Stop being mad, okay?

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.160
I won't do that again.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:28.440
It was a mistake.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.960
What was the mistake?

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.090
That I sent you someone's love letter.

00:26:34.070 --> 00:26:36.000
Have you ever had a crush on anyone?

00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:37.730
Are you looking down at me?

00:26:37.830 --> 00:26:38.590
So what if I've never

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:39.790
had a crush on anyone?

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.680
Why take it away?

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.310
The girl who you just talked to

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:48.720
seemed quite nice.

00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:51.670
Is she the girl
mentioned in your paper cranes?

00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:53.880
She is pretty, isn't she?

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.790
How come you've never told me about her?

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.030
Well...

00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.880
She's this madam's granddaughter.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.960
She just asked me to take a family photo

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.070
of her and her grandmother like this one.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:17.790
Sounds lovely.

00:27:17.790 --> 00:27:18.850
When will you do it?

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.510
I'm not sure if I'll do it.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.160
Why not?

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:27.350
I think... an important photo like this

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.070
should be taken

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.800
by someone more professional.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.640
Have some confidence in yourself, alright?

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.900
You take great photos.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:44.480
Hello?

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.360
Hey, Xiaole, where are you?

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.180
We're already downstairs at your place.

00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:51.640
So it means

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.750
everyone in this family photo is gone,

00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:55.810
except Xiaorou and her grandmother?

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.240
Her grandmother has no idea

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.300
that her daughter and son-in-law
already passed away.

00:28:01.030 --> 00:28:02.270
That's so sad.

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.440
We can do a role play.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:09.790
Perhaps it'll jog

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.510
her grandmother's memory.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.020
That's a good idea!

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.960
Xiaorou has indeed encountered
a harsh reality.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.400
But do we have time to help her?

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400
Exams are coming up,

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.720
and our grades are terrible.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.550
If I fail again,

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.950
my mom won't be nice to me.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.550
The time is pressing,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.400
but Xiaorou

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.000
desperately needs our help.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.310
Plus, Xiaole is a great photographer.

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.170
I'm sure he'd love to contribute.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.000
Stop trying to be a savior.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.460
Respect everyone's fate.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.360
This is Xiaole's business.

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.110
Well...

00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:48.830
Will you help?

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:55.480
I... am not sure.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.110
How about... we hold a vote?

00:28:58.640 --> 00:28:59.480
Wait a minute.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.070
This is my own business.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.160
Letting you vote on it

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.070
makes me look utterly indecisive.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.600
You are really indecisive.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.880
But we're a team.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.510
Yes, we are a team.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.240
Your business is our business.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.350
Don't stand on ceremony, lad.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.160
Hello!

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.240
-Zhao Zhenghao?
-You all missed me a lot, didn't you?

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.070
You came at the perfect time.

00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:24.400
Let me ask you something.

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.640
We'd like to help a stranger

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.640
fulfill her wish.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.550
Are you for or against it?

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.070
Say what now?

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.880
Give me an answer.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.790
That sounds fun.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:35.880
Okay, three to two. We win.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.790
What "three to two"?

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.850
Zhao Zhenghao's vote doesn't count.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:39.960
He has joined us

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.750
in so many events.

00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:42.640
-Do you still not see him one of us?
-Wait.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.570
What do you mean?

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.640
Have I never been taken seriously?

00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:46.310
Fine, I'm leaving then.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:48.070
You're of course
an important member of ours.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.470
Your vote surely counts.

00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.880
Tong Xiaole's vote is also valid.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.070
As the person involved,

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:54.110
he doesn't get to vote.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.590
It's a tie, three to three.

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:56.790
Though he appears reluctant,

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:57.640
he actually wants to do it.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.790
He just hates for us to interfere.

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.640
Enough!

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:00.790
Wait. What's going on?

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:01.750
Quiet down.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.270
This discussion has nothing

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:05.070
to do with the one we had earlier.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.400
Don't waste time.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:11.410
How about this?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.600
I'll do it.

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:14.480
Listen,

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.400
next Friday after school,

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:18.080
come join me if you're free.

00:30:18.550 --> 00:30:20.160
Now, all of you are

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.520
satisfied, huh?

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.260
What happened?

00:30:27.790 --> 00:30:28.720
Care to explain?

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:31.260
[Class 9, Grade 12]

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:00.160
It's so dark in here.

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:01.790
Dusty, too.

00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:04.070
So much dust around.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.360
How long until they arrive?

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.510
Let me check.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.610
Xiaorou said it'd take one more hour.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:20.750
We need to restore this place

00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:22.310
to how it used to look, right?

00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.750
Yeah.

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.790
Then... let's get to work.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:25.790
Okay.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:38.160
It looks quite decent!

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.730
What do you think, guys?

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:40.720
You look good.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.520
Just alright.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.830
The only similarity is your outfit.

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:44.830
It's fine.

00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:46.310
If that old lady mistakes Xiaorou
for her daughter,

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.770
then she'll probably mistake me
for her son.

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:50.270
Chen Fan.

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.560
You look quite like the part.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.960
Why did you bring me

00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.310
to the old house?

00:31:58.030 --> 00:31:59.830
Why are there so many people?

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:02.590
This is the photographer I hired.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:03.070
He will

00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:04.130
take photos for us.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.040
Hello, ma'am.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.190
Why are you all standing?

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.020
Have a seat.

00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:10.030
Be seated.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.640
Sit down.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.070
Okay.

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.550
This is my son's outfit.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.160
Why are you wearing my son's outfit?

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.550
He's wearing my son's outfit!

00:32:17.550 --> 00:32:19.240
I am your son's colleague.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.910
I have the same outfit as him.

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.480
He said he missed you a lot,

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.510
so he sent us here in particular

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.400
to take a photo of you.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:26.860
He'd love to see your face.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:28.240
What...

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.590
What did you say?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.790
My son missed me?

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:32.920
-Yes, a lot.
-Right.

00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:33.740
Yes.

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:35.590
My son missed me...

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:36.560
Hurry.

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:37.350
-Ma'am...
-Hurry!

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:38.550
Take a photo of me!

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:40.160
-Take a photo of me now!
-Ma'am, stand here.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.640
Well,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640
do I look fine?

00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.510
Is my outfit okay?

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.350
-You look great!
-You look great!

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:44.160
Really?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640
Look here, ma'am.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.830
Three, two, one.

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.450
Thank you so much.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:53.070
Grandma passed away peacefully.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:53.640
Really,

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.790
thank you for breaking your rule

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.450
and taking this last photo
of my grandmother.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:00.830
Xiaole!

00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:02.310
Xiaole!

00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:03.400
Dad.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:04.190
Come here.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:06.240
Mom and Dad are back.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:07.880
