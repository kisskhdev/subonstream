{\an8}ADAPTED FROM A SHUQI.COM NOVEL
ORIGINAL AUTHOR: SENLIN LU

00:01:34.625 --> 00:01:38.265
Jianning Iron Army
was quietly dismissed after the incident.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.305
The leading generals
disappeared into thin air.

00:01:41.985 --> 00:01:43.985
Has Your Ladyship truly

00:01:44.065 --> 00:01:46.665
never wondered what lies behind all this?

00:01:51.705 --> 00:01:54.225
You were the only one
who delivered the decree that night?

00:01:55.305 --> 00:01:56.145
That's right.

00:01:58.105 --> 00:02:00.025
It's just your one-sided story

00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:03.065
that my father went crazy
and killed everyone.

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:10.584
To slander my father, are you even worthy?

00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:12.505
A Left General of the Imperial Guards

00:02:12.585 --> 00:02:14.585
is not qualified
to send decrees to Prince of Duan.

00:02:15.185 --> 00:02:16.265
No more games.

00:02:17.865 --> 00:02:21.265
Who did His Majesty
send to deliver the decree?

00:02:21.345 --> 00:02:22.145
Confess.

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:33.465
Get him.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:36.345
Hold the exit.

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:37.745
Search the area carefully.

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:54.385
Search every corner.

00:02:59.985 --> 00:03:00.825
Your Ladyship.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:02.825
We are here for reinforcement.

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:04.225
He jumped into the river.

00:03:04.305 --> 00:03:05.665
Our men are after him.

00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:07.665
- Mr. Xiao sent you?
- Yes.

00:03:16.545 --> 00:03:17.665
Lv Chongshan.

00:03:18.465 --> 00:03:20.505
Your master must know that I found you.

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:22.425
You need to make a decision.

00:03:22.505 --> 00:03:25.145
Who's more likely to save you,
your master or me?

00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:28.665
I don't need you to save me.

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:52.705
Stop.

00:04:15.785 --> 00:04:17.585
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

00:04:23.505 --> 00:04:25.065
Mr. Xiao. What should we do next?

00:04:26.105 --> 00:04:28.185
He can't leave the ward. Search southward.

00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:29.625
- Understood.
- Understood.

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.985
- Who are you?
- A debt collector.

00:05:00.465 --> 00:05:02.105
We searched all around the canal.

00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:03.465
Nothing.

00:05:03.545 --> 00:05:05.625
Lv Chongshan is very likely
hiding in someone's house.

00:05:06.225 --> 00:05:07.385
It's hard to search every household.

00:05:07.465 --> 00:05:09.145
By the time we obtain a warrant,

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.185
Lv Chongshan may have fled.

00:05:12.385 --> 00:05:14.185
We know who he is now.

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:16.905
The poison and injuries
need treatment, after all.

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:20.185
I'm worried he might die.

00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:22.465
We made such a commotion.

00:05:22.545 --> 00:05:24.425
The mastermind might get rid of him.

00:05:25.265 --> 00:05:27.345
Look into Lv Chongshan's background.

00:05:27.425 --> 00:05:29.305
Who transferred

00:05:29.385 --> 00:05:31.145
a Left General of the Imperial Guards
to the Andong Protectorate?

00:05:31.865 --> 00:05:32.985
Understood.

00:05:36.025 --> 00:05:37.225
Why isn't Mr. Xiao back yet?

00:05:38.305 --> 00:05:39.465
Your Ladyship.

00:05:39.545 --> 00:05:41.425
A servant from the Xiao's Mansion
is here for something urgent.

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:43.505
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

00:05:43.585 --> 00:05:44.905
Young Master is in trouble.

00:05:46.705 --> 00:05:48.985
- What?
- Young Master came home unexpectedly

00:05:49.065 --> 00:05:51.425
and asked Master out
to discuss some matters.

00:05:57.905 --> 00:05:58.985
Young Master, you're back.

00:05:59.065 --> 00:06:01.545
Qingfeng. Please get my father.

00:06:01.625 --> 00:06:04.265
I'd like to talk to him
at the Swallow House over a drink.

00:06:04.905 --> 00:06:07.105
Tell him to bring the sachet
my mother made for me.

00:06:07.185 --> 00:06:10.665
The one I've been wearing lately.
I'll be waiting in the carriage.

00:06:11.265 --> 00:06:12.385
Understood.

00:06:15.945 --> 00:06:17.585
He is still on duty today.

00:06:18.105 --> 00:06:19.905
As an official of the Astronomical Bureau,

00:06:19.985 --> 00:06:22.665
he invited me
to the Pingkang Ward for a drink?

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:26.545
This is bad.

00:06:26.625 --> 00:06:27.585
Something is wrong.

00:06:27.665 --> 00:06:28.945
Young Master said it on purpose.

00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:30.825
He didn't want you to show up.

00:06:30.905 --> 00:06:33.465
Should I tell him that you're still out?

00:06:33.545 --> 00:06:36.505
Something is threatening him
to lure me out.

00:06:36.585 --> 00:06:38.825
If I don't show up,
he will be in deeper trouble.

00:06:38.905 --> 00:06:41.905
Should I ask the guards to encircle them
and save Young Master?

00:06:43.065 --> 00:06:46.145
Huaijin said not to bring anyone.
Let's not take any chances.

00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:50.145
After I get in, send someone
to follow us in secret.

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.865
Qingfeng.
Go to the Palace Investigation Bureau

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:53.905
and ask Her Ladyship for help.

00:06:53.985 --> 00:06:55.225
Understood.

00:06:57.665 --> 00:06:59.705
I couldn't stop Master, so I rushed here.

00:07:00.305 --> 00:07:01.545
Are they still following the carriage?

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:03.505
Our people lost track of it.

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:05.345
But I think it's heading
to the Chongren Ward.

00:07:10.985 --> 00:07:13.585
Sachet. Chongren Ward.

00:07:15.465 --> 00:07:16.465
Mr. Gu. Come with me.

00:07:31.385 --> 00:07:32.985
PRINCE OF DUAN'S MANOR

00:07:44.065 --> 00:07:45.985
- Father.
- My darling.

00:07:47.505 --> 00:07:49.585
- Did you miss me?
- I missed you so much!

00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:51.065
Let's go.

00:07:55.985 --> 00:07:57.105
Your Ladyship.

00:08:04.505 --> 00:08:06.865
MEMORIAL TABLET OF PRINCE OF DUAN

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:13.025
Confess your crime
in front of the memorial tablets

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:15.625
of the Prince of Duan
and Princess Consort of Duan.

00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:18.665
I didn't frame the Prince of Duan.

00:08:21.345 --> 00:08:23.225
- Xiao Huaijin.
- Stay back.

00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:26.545
I'll make him confess his crime
in front of the Prince of Duan.

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:28.385
He deserves it.

00:08:33.264 --> 00:08:34.385
Xiao Huaijin.

00:08:35.784 --> 00:08:36.945
Are you alright?

00:08:37.024 --> 00:08:37.865
I'm fine.

00:08:44.545 --> 00:08:46.665
- Look after your father.
- Be careful.

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:49.945
PROPITIOUS WINDS AND NOURISHING RAINS

00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:07.825
Uncle Luo?

00:09:07.905 --> 00:09:09.745
CHEN LUO, MODAO
CORPS COMMANDANT, JIANNING IRON ARMY

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:13.985
I never thought Your Ladyship
would still remember me.

00:09:15.425 --> 00:09:18.385
Commandant of Jianning Iron Army.
When you came for the duty report,

00:09:18.465 --> 00:09:21.665
you stayed with us for a while
and taught me swordplay.

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:24.625
But why did you abduct
Grand Tutor Xiao and Astronomer Xiao?

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:29.185
I, Chen Luo, must avenge
the Prince of Duan.

00:09:30.305 --> 00:09:33.945
This man slaughtered the entire household.

00:09:35.265 --> 00:09:39.025
That night, did the Jianning Iron Army
really enter the city?

00:09:40.105 --> 00:09:44.345
The Jianning Iron Army
has always been loyal to the Great Tang.

00:09:44.425 --> 00:09:46.985
We understand the rule that we shall not

00:09:47.065 --> 00:09:48.305
enter the capital without summons.

00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:52.545
But at that time, we had no other choice.

00:09:53.145 --> 00:09:55.465
Around the Winter Solstice,
His Highness returned.

00:09:55.545 --> 00:09:58.105
Soon after, we heard rumors
that celestial signs indicated rebellion,

00:09:58.705 --> 00:10:00.865
and His Majesty
planned to kill His Highness

00:10:00.945 --> 00:10:03.265
on the night of the Lantern Festival.

00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:06.105
We were worried for His Highness,

00:10:06.185 --> 00:10:08.945
so we sent him letters
through intermediaries,

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.425
but there was never any reply.

00:10:11.065 --> 00:10:12.905
As the day drew near,

00:10:12.985 --> 00:10:15.345
we grew increasingly anxious
for His Highness

00:10:15.945 --> 00:10:18.185
and risked violating military orders.

00:10:18.705 --> 00:10:19.785
We decided

00:10:19.865 --> 00:10:22.105
to sneak in during
the Lantern Festival night

00:10:22.185 --> 00:10:24.625
when the curfew was lifted
to gather information.

00:10:25.225 --> 00:10:26.625
How many people came?

00:10:27.225 --> 00:10:29.225
About a dozen of us.

00:10:29.865 --> 00:10:30.905
To avoid suspicion,

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:33.585
we wore plain clothes
and carried no weapons.

00:10:33.665 --> 00:10:36.185
But I fell seriously
ill at the last moment,

00:10:36.265 --> 00:10:37.545
so they went ahead.

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:38.945
By the time I arrived,

00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:41.945
the streets were filled
with undercover guards.

00:10:42.025 --> 00:10:44.505
Our people were detained
right after they entered the city.

00:10:45.145 --> 00:10:48.185
I hid in the crowd and escaped capture.

00:10:49.105 --> 00:10:49.945
After that,

00:10:50.025 --> 00:10:53.025
I rushed straight to His Highness
without any delay.

00:10:57.985 --> 00:11:00.025
I tried to see that man's face,

00:11:00.545 --> 00:11:02.665
but I just couldn't.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:05.785
However, I noticed the unique design

00:11:05.865 --> 00:11:08.065
of the jade pendant he wore.

00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:16.465
I saw someone approaching

00:11:16.545 --> 00:11:18.465
and feared I would be discovered

00:11:18.545 --> 00:11:20.105
and cause His Highness trouble.

00:11:20.185 --> 00:11:21.905
So I left in a hurry.

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:26.305
But the next day, news spread
throughout the Western Capital

00:11:27.385 --> 00:11:29.545
that His Highness had gone mad
on the Lantern Festival night

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:30.985
and slaughtered his entire household.

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:33.905
But I knew that the man

00:11:33.985 --> 00:11:37.105
who showed up at the manor
framed His Highness.

00:11:37.185 --> 00:11:39.465
I wanted to find the culprit,

00:11:40.145 --> 00:11:43.745
but I didn't know anyone in the capital,

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:46.025
and a jade pendant alone

00:11:46.825 --> 00:11:49.945
couldn't help me find that person.

00:11:56.545 --> 00:11:59.265
Thankfully, not long after,

00:12:00.185 --> 00:12:03.745
I heard that Your Ladyship
wasn't home that night and survived.

00:12:04.905 --> 00:12:08.825
I decided then
that I must tell you the truth.

00:12:09.345 --> 00:12:13.785
Your father never went crazy
or plotted a rebellion.

00:12:14.985 --> 00:12:17.745
Why didn't you come to me all these years?

00:12:18.585 --> 00:12:21.785
After the incident,
there were undercover guards everywhere.

00:12:22.385 --> 00:12:24.185
I didn't dare show myself easily.

00:12:24.945 --> 00:12:29.585
Then you moved into the palace.
I had even less chance to meet you.

00:12:30.185 --> 00:12:31.545
Finally, a few months ago,

00:12:32.105 --> 00:12:34.265
I heard you were returning
from Ping'en County.

00:12:34.345 --> 00:12:36.785
So I waited at the county border.

00:13:03.745 --> 00:13:07.105
I didn't know who you were with,
so I didn't approach you.

00:13:07.705 --> 00:13:10.385
Instead, I stepped back
and waited in secret.

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.225
Your Ladyship, please.

00:13:13.585 --> 00:13:17.585
I kept drawing
that jade pendant every day.

00:13:18.145 --> 00:13:19.705
Even with my eyes closed,

00:13:19.785 --> 00:13:22.385
I could sketch it perfectly.

00:13:23.105 --> 00:13:26.665
For more than ten years,
I've searched tirelessly,

00:13:27.185 --> 00:13:29.105
and there, it just showed up.

00:13:29.185 --> 00:13:30.865
I can finally

00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:34.345
avenge His Highness.

00:13:35.185 --> 00:13:37.345
But Grand Tutor Xiao is not the culprit.

00:13:38.385 --> 00:13:39.705
That night, I was home.

00:13:40.345 --> 00:13:43.225
Astronomer Xiao saved me from death,

00:13:43.305 --> 00:13:45.345
and his father
escorted me into the palace.

00:13:46.105 --> 00:13:47.345
They are not our enemies.

00:13:48.145 --> 00:13:48.985
But…

00:13:49.545 --> 00:13:50.905
I swear I saw…

00:13:50.985 --> 00:13:53.865
That night, both of us arrived too late.

00:14:00.145 --> 00:14:04.105
I acted foolishly and rashly,
nearly making a grave mistake.

00:14:04.705 --> 00:14:07.905
Once our vengeance is fulfilled,
I will accept any punishment.

00:14:07.985 --> 00:14:09.065
Please get up.

00:14:11.985 --> 00:14:14.545
You only meant to avenge
the Prince of Duan.

00:14:15.785 --> 00:14:19.305
With a subordinate like you,
he can rest without regrets.

00:14:24.105 --> 00:14:27.705
Your Ladyship. Your father
had no intention of rebellion.

00:14:31.825 --> 00:14:33.105
Grand Tutor, do you know

00:14:33.825 --> 00:14:36.425
the General of the Andong Protectorate,
Lv Chongshan?

00:14:38.105 --> 00:14:40.025
I have heard that name before.

00:14:40.545 --> 00:14:41.385
But…

00:14:41.985 --> 00:14:43.105
Fifteen years ago,

00:14:43.185 --> 00:14:44.665
he was the Left General
of the Imperial Guards.

00:14:45.345 --> 00:14:46.745
He also told me

00:14:46.825 --> 00:14:49.625
that there were rumors about my father
plotting a rebellion.

00:14:50.465 --> 00:14:51.905
So it seems

00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:54.705
someone framed your father,
fueled His Majesty's suspicions,

00:14:55.305 --> 00:14:57.945
and then used court rumors
to lure the Jianning Iron Army in

00:14:58.545 --> 00:15:00.425
to solidify the evidence of the rebellion.

00:15:00.505 --> 00:15:02.745
But if His Majesty knew about it,

00:15:03.345 --> 00:15:04.665
why did he let it slide?

00:15:05.465 --> 00:15:08.145
Even if he spared my life
out of familial bond,

00:15:08.225 --> 00:15:10.705
why would he put
his favorite consort to look after me?

00:15:11.425 --> 00:15:12.625
Did he realize that your father

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:14.585
had no rebellious intentions?

00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:17.145
The Prince of Duan
must have heard the gossip

00:15:17.225 --> 00:15:21.105
and the celestial signs
of "Mars invades the Heart".

00:15:22.185 --> 00:15:24.825
In fact, he was planning to step down,

00:15:24.905 --> 00:15:27.145
return the command tally,
and stay in the capital

00:15:27.225 --> 00:15:28.825
with his family.

00:15:29.425 --> 00:15:31.625
Judging by His Majesty's
attitude afterward,

00:15:31.705 --> 00:15:34.625
the command tally was clearly returned.

00:15:35.465 --> 00:15:36.865
If that's the case,

00:15:36.945 --> 00:15:39.545
His Majesty shouldn't have
suspected His Highness,

00:15:40.265 --> 00:15:43.425
and our brothers
wouldn't have disappeared without a trace.

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:46.745
Lv Chongshan said that His Majesty
summoned my father,

00:15:46.825 --> 00:15:48.025
but my father refused the order.

00:15:48.625 --> 00:15:51.665
That's why Lv Chongshan
went to bring my father.

00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:53.265
Do you know about this?

00:16:02.385 --> 00:16:03.225
Uncle Luo.

00:16:04.265 --> 00:16:06.225
What time did you arrive
at the manor that night?

00:16:07.545 --> 00:16:10.745
We agreed to enter the city
at the hour of Hai,

00:16:10.825 --> 00:16:12.425
but I was already running late.

00:16:12.505 --> 00:16:14.505
I can't remember exactly when

00:16:16.705 --> 00:16:18.145
I reached the manor.

00:16:19.185 --> 00:16:20.425
And you?

00:16:21.545 --> 00:16:22.945
I don't remember clearly either,

00:16:23.025 --> 00:16:25.585
but it was definitely
after the hour of Hai.

00:16:28.305 --> 00:16:30.745
BEGINNING OF THE SI HOUR

00:16:34.545 --> 00:16:36.945
GRACEFUL VIRTUE, TIMELY RAINS

00:16:40.585 --> 00:16:43.305
When the sun is high above the head
and the shadow is short at the feet.

00:16:43.385 --> 00:16:44.985
- What time is that?
- The Wu hour.

00:16:47.105 --> 00:16:50.025
But at that time, the water clock
at home read the Si hour.

00:16:52.105 --> 00:16:53.825
The water clock was two hours slow.

00:16:53.905 --> 00:16:56.625
So the Prince of Duan didn't intend
to defy the imperial decree.

00:16:57.185 --> 00:16:59.705
The water clock in his manor
had been tampered with.

00:17:00.625 --> 00:17:03.905
He thought it was still early,
but His Majesty believed

00:17:03.985 --> 00:17:05.825
he was refusing to enter the palace.

00:17:06.545 --> 00:17:09.745
It gets dark early in winter.
It's hard to tell the time by the sky.

00:17:09.825 --> 00:17:11.145
That's why the Prince of Duan
didn't realize.

00:17:12.585 --> 00:17:15.105
So, an unjust charge
can be fabricated so easily.

00:17:15.905 --> 00:17:18.105
It was a setup from the beginning.

00:17:19.745 --> 00:17:20.985
Grand Tutor.

00:17:21.065 --> 00:17:22.025
Mr. Xiao.

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:23.944
I acted recklessly.

00:17:24.505 --> 00:17:25.704
This is unforgivable.

00:17:26.424 --> 00:17:28.105
There's no need to blame yourself.

00:17:28.705 --> 00:17:30.905
Blame fate for its cruel trick.

00:17:38.025 --> 00:17:38.865
Father.

00:17:40.105 --> 00:17:41.305
Your wound…

00:17:42.545 --> 00:17:45.265
I was desperate to stop him.
That's how he got this.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:46.905
What weapon is it?

00:17:50.265 --> 00:17:51.585
Lv Chongshan's hidden weapon.

00:17:54.385 --> 00:17:55.505
I've seen wounds like this.

00:17:56.545 --> 00:17:57.825
The tragedy that night

00:17:58.425 --> 00:18:01.425
could never have been caused
by the Prince of Duan going mad.

00:18:02.825 --> 00:18:07.785
That night, before I found Huaijin,
I saw a severely injured young eunuch

00:18:08.745 --> 00:18:12.145
in the alleys
near the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:18:12.705 --> 00:18:13.985
Who did this?

00:18:17.465 --> 00:18:18.745
Why are you here?

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:20.385
Who sent you?

00:18:32.385 --> 00:18:34.185
The wound on his neck was just like this.

00:18:34.785 --> 00:18:38.545
The flesh around it was torn,
as if hooked by barbs.

00:18:39.465 --> 00:18:41.145
Lv Chongshan killed that eunuch?

00:18:42.185 --> 00:18:45.025
I couldn't tell who had killed him,

00:18:45.105 --> 00:18:47.705
but he must have been sent

00:18:48.305 --> 00:18:49.865
by the palace to deliver an edict.

00:18:49.945 --> 00:18:52.945
I bet he knew what had happened
inside the manor.

00:18:54.185 --> 00:18:56.225
I wanted to ask more,

00:18:56.785 --> 00:18:57.985
but he was badly injured.

00:18:58.065 --> 00:19:00.585
That wound was enough to take his life.

00:19:01.385 --> 00:19:03.825
After that, I ran into Huaijin and you.

00:19:04.425 --> 00:19:07.225
I handed you over
to Inspector Du and left.

00:19:09.305 --> 00:19:10.345
I remember now.

00:19:12.905 --> 00:19:16.305
I saw your clothes stained with blood.
It was at that hour.

00:19:18.505 --> 00:19:21.745
All these years,
I've hated the wrong person.

00:19:23.865 --> 00:19:24.985
Lv Chongshan knew exactly

00:19:25.065 --> 00:19:26.825
what kind of wound
a fingertip blade would leave,

00:19:26.905 --> 00:19:29.105
so he would do his best
to cover his tracks.

00:19:29.745 --> 00:19:30.825
I followed the investigation

00:19:30.905 --> 00:19:32.945
of the Imperial Guard
and the Palace Investigation Bureau.

00:19:33.025 --> 00:19:36.065
There was no record of a eunuch's death.

00:19:36.705 --> 00:19:39.505
Since they could twist the truth
and claim that the Prince of Duan

00:19:39.585 --> 00:19:41.585
went mad and slaughtered everyone,

00:19:42.385 --> 00:19:45.065
disposing of a single eunuch's body
would have been easy.

00:19:45.945 --> 00:19:48.425
But delivering an edict to Prince of Duan

00:19:48.505 --> 00:19:50.265
requires more than just one young eunuch.

00:19:50.345 --> 00:19:52.145
I also investigated the records

00:19:52.225 --> 00:19:54.225
of eunuchs sent out
of the palace that night.

00:19:55.265 --> 00:19:56.185
But…

00:19:57.025 --> 00:19:58.585
To find out the truth,

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:00.985
there's only one way left.

00:20:01.985 --> 00:20:03.305
You must not act rashly.

00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:07.505
But only he knows who else
visited my home that day.

00:20:10.425 --> 00:20:11.265
Mr. Gu.

00:20:13.025 --> 00:20:14.305
Has Her Ladyship gone crazy?

00:20:14.905 --> 00:20:16.065
We can't stop her.

00:20:16.785 --> 00:20:19.985
She will break through this wall,

00:20:21.305 --> 00:20:22.665
even if it bleeds her dry.

00:20:28.345 --> 00:20:31.705
{\an8}ZICHEN HALL

00:20:59.985 --> 00:21:00.825
Your…

00:21:01.545 --> 00:21:02.385
Your Ladyship.

00:21:02.465 --> 00:21:04.105
His Majesty still won't see me?

00:21:06.585 --> 00:21:10.385
His Majesty refuses to see you
for your own good.

00:21:11.065 --> 00:21:13.665
So His Majesty knows why I've come.

00:21:14.945 --> 00:21:18.425
He should also know
I must ask about this matter.

00:21:19.025 --> 00:21:20.185
Your Ladyship.

00:21:21.465 --> 00:21:24.985
You know how much
His Majesty cares for you.

00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:28.185
Well… You shouldn't push him so hard.

00:21:28.865 --> 00:21:30.345
His Majesty won't see you.

00:21:31.025 --> 00:21:34.225
That's already an extraordinary favor.

00:21:36.585 --> 00:21:37.745
No one understands

00:21:37.825 --> 00:21:40.985
why His Majesty would care
about someone like me,

00:21:41.065 --> 00:21:43.025
a parentless and unruly cursed lone star.

00:21:43.625 --> 00:21:46.705
Of course, I know there's no such thing
as unconditional favor.

00:21:46.785 --> 00:21:50.185
That's why I want to ask His Majesty
for any explanation.

00:21:50.825 --> 00:21:54.225
His Majesty shows you compassion.

00:21:54.305 --> 00:21:56.865
What more could Your Ladyship
possibly want?

00:21:56.945 --> 00:21:59.785
I've always had the habit
of digging to the root of things.

00:21:59.865 --> 00:22:01.465
That's why I became an investigator.

00:22:02.185 --> 00:22:05.425
Your Ladyship, I'm afraid,
even if you keep kneeling like this,

00:22:05.505 --> 00:22:07.265
i-it's all in vain.

00:22:07.905 --> 00:22:08.745
No way.

00:22:09.785 --> 00:22:12.305
His Majesty can't stay inside forever
just to hide from me.

00:22:13.185 --> 00:22:15.465
Once he can't stand it, he'll see me.

00:22:27.585 --> 00:22:30.585
ZICHEN HALL

00:23:01.745 --> 00:23:02.745
The night is deep.

00:23:03.505 --> 00:23:04.945
His Majesty must be tired.

00:23:06.665 --> 00:23:09.465
Your Ladyship,
have you considered the consequences?

00:23:10.065 --> 00:23:12.625
I've fought to live until today
for this very reason.

00:23:13.385 --> 00:23:15.265
One benefit of being a cursed lone star

00:23:15.865 --> 00:23:17.425
is that no one gets implicated.

00:23:18.025 --> 00:23:20.305
His Majesty can't wipe out my entire clan.

00:23:20.385 --> 00:23:21.545
What's there to fear?

00:23:22.865 --> 00:23:25.585
Then, please follow me inside.

00:23:32.065 --> 00:23:35.185
It seems some things can hold you back.

00:23:36.345 --> 00:23:38.785
- Why don't you wait a bit?
- Let's go.

00:24:10.465 --> 00:24:11.985
You won't even observe
the basic etiquette now?

00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:15.785
If Your Majesty can tolerate my questions,

00:24:16.385 --> 00:24:18.025
you won't hold my disrespect against me.

00:24:18.105 --> 00:24:22.185
If you can't, then just kill me.
How I behave makes no difference.

00:24:24.025 --> 00:24:26.105
You use my indulgence toward you

00:24:27.385 --> 00:24:28.305
to defy me.

00:24:29.145 --> 00:24:30.425
I just want to know

00:24:31.385 --> 00:24:35.145
whether you are showing me compassion
or making up for something?

00:24:47.265 --> 00:24:48.665
Aren't you afraid of death?

00:24:50.905 --> 00:24:53.905
People say I act recklessly,
beyond all laws.

00:24:54.505 --> 00:24:55.745
But they don't know

00:24:56.345 --> 00:24:58.985
I've always struggled to stay alive

00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:01.865
just so I could die
for something that truly matters.

00:25:01.945 --> 00:25:04.585
If I can exchange my life for the truth,

00:25:05.345 --> 00:25:06.225
then it's worth it.

00:25:14.505 --> 00:25:17.985
VIRTUE SHINING, EVER-PROGRESSING

00:25:26.705 --> 00:25:29.225
First, you chose the wrong moment.

00:25:31.745 --> 00:25:32.625
Second,

00:25:34.185 --> 00:25:37.385
you overvalued your own life.

00:25:37.905 --> 00:25:38.865
Third,

00:25:39.585 --> 00:25:41.065
everything you possess

00:25:41.865 --> 00:25:43.265
can be taken away at any time.

00:25:58.745 --> 00:26:02.545
Your Ladyship.
His Majesty has sent an oral decree.

00:26:03.065 --> 00:26:03.985
He said

00:26:05.225 --> 00:26:07.065
that since you are
obsessed with the truth,

00:26:07.145 --> 00:26:08.745
stay at the Prince of Duan's manor
to investigate.

00:26:08.825 --> 00:26:11.385
You're not allowed to leave
without His Majesty's decree.

00:26:16.185 --> 00:26:19.065
It seems I made the right bet this time.

00:26:19.665 --> 00:26:21.705
W-What do you mean you gambled right?

00:26:21.785 --> 00:26:24.985
His Majesty knows something,
but not the whole truth.

00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:26.945
The mastermind has some nerves.

00:26:27.545 --> 00:26:28.985
When I find that person,

00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:30.425
His Majesty will learn
the full story, too.

00:26:31.825 --> 00:26:32.945
Your Ladyship.

00:26:33.465 --> 00:26:35.545
His Majesty is confining you

00:26:35.625 --> 00:26:38.985
in a manor abandoned for 15 years.

00:26:39.065 --> 00:26:42.465
How can you still think
about these things?

00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:45.625
You should be considering
your own predicament.

00:26:45.705 --> 00:26:47.345
His Majesty hasn't killed me yet.

00:26:48.025 --> 00:26:49.105
So I won't stop.

00:26:49.905 --> 00:26:52.785
Besides, that is my home.
What is there to fear?

00:26:52.865 --> 00:26:53.785
Your…

00:27:09.705 --> 00:27:10.705
Your Ladyship.

00:27:11.225 --> 00:27:13.825
By decree, you are grounded here.

00:27:13.905 --> 00:27:16.425
Guards will deliver meals every day.

00:27:17.025 --> 00:27:18.425
Consort Shu has also

00:27:18.505 --> 00:27:20.825
sent your maids here to serve you.

00:27:21.945 --> 00:27:24.025
Your Ladyship. Please.

00:27:26.985 --> 00:27:30.025
PRINCE OF DUAN'S MANOR

00:27:54.145 --> 00:27:57.745
No one has lived here for 15 years.
I wanted to clean it up a bit.

00:28:08.905 --> 00:28:11.305
I have plenty of time to pass here.

00:28:11.905 --> 00:28:14.265
If you clean it all now,
I might die of boredom.

00:28:14.985 --> 00:28:16.105
I'll get you out of here.

00:28:17.305 --> 00:28:18.945
I've gotten myself into serious trouble.

00:28:19.665 --> 00:28:21.265
Then I'll think
of an unusual way to save you.

00:28:23.625 --> 00:28:25.585
Well, you made me curious.

00:28:25.665 --> 00:28:26.625
Boss.

00:28:29.905 --> 00:28:30.745
Boss.

00:28:32.105 --> 00:28:32.945
Your Ladyship.

00:28:34.065 --> 00:28:35.505
I'm punished, not rewarded.

00:28:35.585 --> 00:28:36.425
With so many people here,

00:28:36.505 --> 00:28:38.705
one might think I'd done something great.

00:28:39.705 --> 00:28:42.145
Boss, have you figured out
how to get out of this?

00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:43.145
How should I help?

00:28:43.905 --> 00:28:44.745
Of course not.

00:28:45.505 --> 00:28:47.585
Aren't you the master
at getting out of trouble?

00:28:48.825 --> 00:28:51.185
There are many ways
to prevent water from boiling,

00:28:51.265 --> 00:28:53.225
but when it's already 99% there,

00:28:53.865 --> 00:28:56.505
no matter what you try, it will boil.

00:29:00.945 --> 00:29:02.665
Is there really nothing we can do?

00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:05.825
Perhaps Heaven will help me.

00:29:06.385 --> 00:29:08.785
Or perhaps Mr. Xiao will find a way.

00:29:10.985 --> 00:29:12.065
Your Ladyship.

00:29:12.705 --> 00:29:13.665
It's time to go in.

00:29:14.385 --> 00:29:15.465
Let us escort Her Ladyship inside.

00:29:16.665 --> 00:29:19.465
Please don't make things difficult for me.

00:29:20.065 --> 00:29:22.385
Her Ladyship is grounded here.

00:29:22.465 --> 00:29:24.065
She may not leave without summons,

00:29:24.665 --> 00:29:26.305
and no outsiders are allowed to visit.

00:29:26.905 --> 00:29:28.305
Can't we even escort her inside?

00:29:29.425 --> 00:29:30.545
No.

00:29:31.985 --> 00:29:33.225
Wait.

00:29:33.305 --> 00:29:36.465
These items must be inspected
by the guards first.

00:29:37.065 --> 00:29:39.785
Eunuch Sun, are you so convinced
that I'll never get out of here?

00:29:41.505 --> 00:29:42.865
Your Ladyship…

00:29:42.945 --> 00:29:45.945
Even now, you're still trying to scare me?

00:29:46.545 --> 00:29:47.585
I…

00:29:50.505 --> 00:29:51.345
Fine.

00:29:52.225 --> 00:29:54.305
Just this once. Never again.

00:29:55.385 --> 00:29:58.065
From now on, don't come to visit.

00:29:58.145 --> 00:29:59.545
Don't upset His Majesty.

00:30:00.665 --> 00:30:02.825
We're going to tidy up
the place for Your Ladyship.

00:30:06.985 --> 00:30:09.305
Boss. Take care of yourself.

00:30:10.385 --> 00:30:12.905
You're the one who needs to take care.

00:30:12.985 --> 00:30:14.785
Your Ladyship. Rest assured.

00:30:14.865 --> 00:30:16.985
I will take good care of her.

00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.825
You'd better keep your word.

00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:21.985
He might not have the fortune for that.

00:30:22.785 --> 00:30:23.865
How could that be?

00:30:23.945 --> 00:30:26.385
Everyone says I'm naturally blessed,
born with good fortune.

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:29.265
You might not be able to handle this.

00:30:34.825 --> 00:30:37.305
Boss. We'll take our leave.

00:30:41.985 --> 00:30:42.825
Let's wait for Mr. Xiao.

00:30:45.945 --> 00:30:48.265
How do you even do your job
with such poor judgment?

00:30:48.345 --> 00:30:49.185
Let's go.

00:30:50.385 --> 00:30:51.825
Wait… Your Ladyship.

00:31:02.105 --> 00:31:03.825
Why are you frowning?

00:31:05.145 --> 00:31:07.705
Although I'm grounded, at least I'm alive.

00:31:08.825 --> 00:31:10.025
I'll get you out of here.

00:31:10.825 --> 00:31:11.705
I know.

00:31:12.425 --> 00:31:13.865
I want you to believe

00:31:14.785 --> 00:31:16.105
that I'll get you out.

00:31:17.545 --> 00:31:18.385
I believe you.

00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:21.265
I know what you're hoping for.

00:31:21.825 --> 00:31:23.865
You didn't find the person
who framed your father,

00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:27.625
but you know that they're watching you.

00:31:28.505 --> 00:31:30.825
You got into trouble and were kicked out.

00:31:30.905 --> 00:31:33.585
This is a great opportunity for them.

00:31:34.185 --> 00:31:36.825
You're waiting for them to grow impatient

00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:39.585
and make a move against you,

00:31:40.345 --> 00:31:43.185
so you have a chance to catch them.

00:31:45.225 --> 00:31:46.745
Nothing escapes you.

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:50.105
And you claim you can't divine fortunes?

00:31:51.225 --> 00:31:52.465
Then tell me.

00:31:53.025 --> 00:31:54.425
Will I catch them?

00:31:55.065 --> 00:31:57.065
- They want to kill you.
- And I want to kill them.

00:31:57.825 --> 00:32:00.505
But they're not worth risking your life.

00:32:03.025 --> 00:32:04.465
I'll get you out of here.

00:32:04.985 --> 00:32:07.185
After that, we'll figure something out.

00:32:10.025 --> 00:32:13.385
Can you give me some time?

00:32:16.745 --> 00:32:18.145
During that time,

00:32:19.505 --> 00:32:20.705
don't harm yourself.

00:32:27.945 --> 00:32:30.145
How can there be someone as good as you?

00:32:33.105 --> 00:32:35.265
It seems I'm not always so unlucky.

00:32:35.905 --> 00:32:37.025
And I may not be so awful.

00:32:37.625 --> 00:32:38.785
You have always been good.

00:32:39.825 --> 00:32:40.985
And you're not unlucky.

00:32:42.145 --> 00:32:43.385
Someone has done evil.

00:32:43.905 --> 00:32:45.225
We will find them.

00:32:46.545 --> 00:32:47.985
When calamity arrives,

00:32:48.945 --> 00:32:50.185
retribution follows without error.

00:32:50.905 --> 00:32:54.225
Those who sow evil seeds
will surely reap bitter fruit.

00:32:55.905 --> 00:32:57.145
I will make sure you see it.

00:33:00.065 --> 00:33:02.225
Your Ladyship. Mr. Xiao.

00:33:03.185 --> 00:33:05.105
I'm sorry, but it's about time.

00:33:17.025 --> 00:33:18.145
Get going.

00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:39.425
I hope you understand me.

00:33:51.745 --> 00:33:52.785
Peiyi.

00:33:56.425 --> 00:33:58.025
Don't let anyone hurt you.

00:33:58.985 --> 00:34:00.345
Don't hurt yourself.

00:34:02.545 --> 00:34:03.505
Rest assured.

00:34:04.385 --> 00:34:07.505
With you around, I can't bear to die.

00:34:28.625 --> 00:34:32.105
PROPITIOUS WINDS AND NOURISHING RAINS

00:34:35.385 --> 00:34:36.344
Father.

00:34:38.304 --> 00:34:39.185
Mother.

00:34:40.505 --> 00:34:41.385
I'm back.

00:34:44.985 --> 00:34:46.545
Let's go play.

00:34:48.705 --> 00:34:49.625
Let's go play.

00:34:49.705 --> 00:34:51.185
Let's go play.

00:34:51.705 --> 00:34:52.744
Your Ladyship, be careful.

00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:54.225
Let's go play.

00:34:59.985 --> 00:35:02.505
GRACEFUL VIRTUE, TIMELY RAINS

00:35:16.185 --> 00:35:18.065
The crane cries under the sun.

00:35:18.745 --> 00:35:20.625
The crane cries under the sun.

00:35:21.465 --> 00:35:23.745
The dragon rides the clouds.

00:35:23.825 --> 00:35:25.505
The dragon rides the clouds.

00:35:25.585 --> 00:35:26.945
Is that right?

00:35:27.025 --> 00:35:27.905
Yes.

00:35:30.225 --> 00:35:32.025
The wolf-eyed Jin Xuan looks back.

00:35:32.665 --> 00:35:34.905
The wolf-eyed Jin Xuan looks back.

00:35:35.425 --> 00:35:37.665
The Han founder bears the dragon's visage.

00:35:37.745 --> 00:35:39.905
The Han founder bears the dragon's visage.

00:35:39.985 --> 00:35:40.905
Is that right?

00:35:41.745 --> 00:35:43.065
Very good.

00:36:09.345 --> 00:36:10.625
Have some more.

00:36:25.025 --> 00:36:26.065
Naughty girl.

00:36:26.145 --> 00:36:28.065
Oh la la!

00:36:28.905 --> 00:36:29.745
Oh la la!

00:36:33.545 --> 00:36:34.745
Little greedy cat, is it good?

00:36:34.825 --> 00:36:35.745
Yes!

00:36:35.825 --> 00:36:37.585
Father, I want to swing.

00:36:38.665 --> 00:36:39.585
Alright.

00:36:39.665 --> 00:36:41.825
Let me take you to the swing.

00:36:41.905 --> 00:36:43.065
- Be careful.
- Come on.

00:36:44.985 --> 00:36:46.025
Come on.

00:36:47.625 --> 00:36:49.425
Alright, sit tight.

00:36:50.785 --> 00:36:52.425
- Is it fun?
- Yes!

00:36:52.505 --> 00:36:53.465
Do you want it higher?

00:36:53.545 --> 00:36:54.385
Yes!

00:37:35.225 --> 00:37:37.585
Your Ladyship. Yuebai
is still tidying up the room.

00:37:37.665 --> 00:37:39.305
It will be ready soon.

00:37:39.385 --> 00:37:40.225
No rush.

00:37:40.745 --> 00:37:42.265
I've been away for 15 years.

00:37:42.345 --> 00:37:43.345
I'll look around.

00:37:43.425 --> 00:37:44.825
The manor is huge.

00:37:44.905 --> 00:37:46.705
Only Yuebai and I are here,

00:37:46.785 --> 00:37:49.105
so it will take some time
to tidy everything up.

00:37:49.185 --> 00:37:52.745
But we'll start with the areas
you want to visit.

00:37:52.825 --> 00:37:55.945
We'll leave the other areas for later.

00:37:56.025 --> 00:37:58.025
This way, you can at least
live comfortably.

00:37:59.545 --> 00:38:02.585
I'm back at home.
It's comfortable, anyway.

00:38:17.105 --> 00:38:18.385
It's locked.

00:38:18.945 --> 00:38:20.865
Why is there a new lock?

00:38:20.945 --> 00:38:23.505
There's no dust or cobwebs on it.

00:38:38.945 --> 00:38:40.025
Please don't!

00:38:40.105 --> 00:38:40.945
Stop!

00:38:50.625 --> 00:38:52.785
Your Ladyship, are you alright?

00:38:53.545 --> 00:38:56.265
Do you wish to enter?
I'll try to open the door.

00:38:57.265 --> 00:38:58.625
You know how to pick locks?

00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:01.065
Not really.

00:39:01.145 --> 00:39:04.505
Although the lock is new,
the door itself is rotten.

00:39:04.585 --> 00:39:06.625
I might be able to remove the door.

00:39:07.905 --> 00:39:10.705
You've become quite like me
after all these years.

00:39:18.065 --> 00:39:20.465
To be honest,
I'm not sure about what I want.

00:39:22.225 --> 00:39:24.185
Since a decision has been made for me,

00:39:24.985 --> 00:39:26.225
I won't enter for now.

00:39:26.905 --> 00:39:28.225
You can divine fortunes?

00:39:31.985 --> 00:39:33.105
It's from Mr. Xiao?

00:39:48.545 --> 00:39:51.145
Mr. Xiao.
How can you still have an appetite?

00:39:51.225 --> 00:39:52.905
How can we save my boss?

00:39:53.505 --> 00:39:54.665
By earning merit.

00:39:54.745 --> 00:39:55.585
By earning merit?

00:39:56.185 --> 00:39:58.145
Only by earning merit
can we petition His Majesty for favor.

00:39:59.505 --> 00:40:00.745
Then how do we earn merit?

00:40:00.825 --> 00:40:02.305
I know one thing His Majesty desires,

00:40:02.385 --> 00:40:04.305
yet no one has been able to complete it.

00:40:13.945 --> 00:40:15.545
I will be in seclusion for a few days.

00:40:15.625 --> 00:40:17.465
Please visit Peiyi for me.

00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:21.785
You're going into seclusion now?

00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:23.625
What if Her Ladyship gets into trouble?

00:40:23.705 --> 00:40:25.865
Enter the palace
and seek Consort Shu's help.

00:40:25.945 --> 00:40:27.505
Also, find Zhao Yudi.

00:40:31.065 --> 00:40:35.145
Mr. Xiao, you're not
abandoning Her Ladyship, right?

00:40:38.065 --> 00:40:41.025
With my current abilities,
I can't look after her.

00:40:41.665 --> 00:40:44.505
Only through seclusion
might there be a slim chance.

00:40:45.385 --> 00:40:46.585
How long will it take?

00:40:47.345 --> 00:40:49.505
At least half a month. Or more.

00:40:53.145 --> 00:40:54.065
I'm not sure.

00:40:54.145 --> 00:40:55.625
- You…
- Wuren.

00:40:57.905 --> 00:40:58.985
Mr. Xiao

00:41:00.145 --> 00:41:01.585
must have his reasons.

00:41:02.225 --> 00:41:05.265
Well, at least tell us
what you'll be doing.

00:41:09.105 --> 00:41:10.265
I can't disclose that.

00:41:10.345 --> 00:41:11.265
Take care.

00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:13.945
You…

00:41:16.625 --> 00:41:17.665
I know you're worried.

00:41:18.265 --> 00:41:19.105
But

00:41:19.905 --> 00:41:23.185
you have to trust Mr. Xiao
and Her Ladyship.

00:42:09.465 --> 00:42:10.185
Master.

00:42:11.585 --> 00:42:12.785
All of you, leave.

00:42:29.945 --> 00:42:31.425
How did you enjoy the show?

00:42:32.105 --> 00:42:34.305
If I perform after
the Southern Suburb Ceremony

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.385
at the banquet,

00:42:35.985 --> 00:42:37.145
will His Majesty like it?

00:42:40.425 --> 00:42:43.385
Intimidating and authoritative.
His Majesty will love it.

00:42:46.185 --> 00:42:47.745
Speak. What is it?

00:42:47.825 --> 00:42:50.425
Li Peiyi knelt outside Zichen Hall
for 16 hours.

00:42:50.505 --> 00:42:51.945
Then His Majesty decreed…

00:42:52.665 --> 00:42:53.705
Decreed what?

00:42:53.785 --> 00:42:55.345
That she be confined
to the Prince of Duan's manor.

00:43:00.225 --> 00:43:03.345
Confinement can still end one day.

00:43:04.065 --> 00:43:04.905
U-Understood.

00:43:05.705 --> 00:43:09.065
Can't you handle things more neatly?

00:43:10.585 --> 00:43:13.785
Why don't you choose one
between you and her

00:43:14.305 --> 00:43:15.945
to keep Du Zhixing company?

00:43:16.665 --> 00:43:17.825
I'll take care of it.

00:43:27.225 --> 00:43:28.305
What are you looking for, Mr. Xiao?

00:43:28.385 --> 00:43:29.625
Let me do it.

00:43:34.785 --> 00:43:36.705
Mr. Xiao, what are you…

00:43:40.505 --> 00:43:41.985
Bring them inside.

00:43:45.745 --> 00:43:46.745
From today onward,

00:43:46.825 --> 00:43:49.385
deliver one meal and a pot of water
each morning and evening.

00:43:49.465 --> 00:43:50.905
At all other times,

00:43:50.985 --> 00:43:53.185
do not disturb me, no matter what happens.

00:43:53.785 --> 00:43:54.665
Mr. Xiao, are you sure His Majesty…

00:43:57.585 --> 00:43:59.105
I'll prepare water and food now.

00:43:59.705 --> 00:44:01.985
- If anyone asks…
- I will claim no knowledge.

00:44:05.985 --> 00:44:06.825
Prepare these for me.

00:44:14.225 --> 00:44:15.505
{\an8}MEAL BOX FOR PRINCE OF DUAN'S MANOR

00:44:21.065 --> 00:44:22.985
Brother Guard, it's cold at night now.

00:44:23.065 --> 00:44:24.305
Please bring some charcoal.

00:44:24.385 --> 00:44:27.065
Her Ladyship's daily necessities
will be delivered on schedule.

00:44:27.145 --> 00:44:29.185
Any extra requests must be reported.

00:44:29.265 --> 00:44:31.705
Then please report it as soon as possible.

00:44:31.785 --> 00:44:34.545
If Her Ladyship falls ill,
we'll all be held accountable.

00:44:37.585 --> 00:44:38.625
What's wrong?

00:44:38.705 --> 00:44:42.385
Aren't you assigned here
to keep Her Ladyship safe?

00:44:42.465 --> 00:44:43.545
Of course I am.

00:44:44.385 --> 00:44:45.385
I will get back to you.

00:44:49.785 --> 00:44:51.785
Your Ladyship, your meal is ready.

00:44:56.585 --> 00:44:58.465
Sister Yuebai, what's wrong?

00:44:59.145 --> 00:45:01.705
I asked the guard
for some charcoal for the night,

00:45:01.785 --> 00:45:03.145
but he acted strangely.

00:45:03.745 --> 00:45:06.865
Is he looking down on us
because Her Ladyship is in trouble?

00:45:07.985 --> 00:45:10.545
If that is the case, I can manage.

00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:12.025
I'll figure something out.

00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:14.945
But he seemed hesitant,
as if hiding something.

00:45:15.025 --> 00:45:16.785
It's unsettling.

00:45:18.385 --> 00:45:19.625
It's alright.

00:45:20.345 --> 00:45:22.465
They need time to weigh the situation

00:45:22.545 --> 00:45:23.945
and decide how to treat me.

00:45:24.545 --> 00:45:28.145
This guard doesn't seem very clever.
If he'd just weighed the meal box,

00:45:28.225 --> 00:45:29.985
he wouldn't dare neglect you.

00:45:30.585 --> 00:45:33.585
I'll go tell him
to deliver the charcoal tonight.

00:45:38.785 --> 00:45:41.705
Your Ladyship.
Is there something wrong with the food?
