It's just different classes—

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.230
is there really a need
for unequal treatment?

With your grades,

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.270

a more competitive school?

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.870
Because you're going there.

after you go to Hailan University,

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:19.460

And without me to protect you,

00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:21.080

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.630

Of course, it's the photo

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:38.340
I took specifically of you that day,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.580
and I developed it specifically...

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.460

You've only captured
a fraction of my charm.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.480

You not only disrupted
the normal order of the school

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:16.460

They're under so much pressure.

00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:27.780
Just give them a lecture.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.910
There's no need to suspend them.

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:29.630
Mr. Bu,

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.610
I understand how you feel.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.390
But rules are rules.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:35.410

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.360
must be dealt with seriously!

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:39.220
But the college entrance exam
is coming up.

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:39.870
Enough.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:43.390
Director Hu, our behavior

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:44.790
was indeed a bit extreme.

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:46.670
We were just trying to

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:48.220
make our voices heard.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.220
We're only asking to be

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.440
treated equally, regardless of our grades.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.910
Tong Xiaole, if you put it that way...

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.350
I think what Tong Xiaole said
is worth reflecting on.

00:29:06.350 --> 00:29:07.190
Our education

00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:09.840
should indeed be more humanized.

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.540
After careful reflection,
the School Committee

00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:21.190
acknowledges
that this decision was flawed.

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:22.500
Any reform

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.190
must be grounded

00:29:23.190 --> 00:29:26.590
in respect for students
and an understanding of their needs.

00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.760
Therefore, we have decided to
revoke the new rules,

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.070
restore the old ones,

00:29:31.540 --> 00:29:33.340
cancel the Experimental Class,

00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:36.010
and ensure that all classes

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:39.130
receive equal attention and resources.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.670
We will also make sure

00:29:41.670 --> 00:29:43.000
every student is heard.

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:45.260
So the perks of the Experimental Class
are gone!

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.460
What am I supposed to do?

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.700
Shut up!

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:48.950
