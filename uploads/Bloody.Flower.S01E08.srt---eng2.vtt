00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:53.885
Woo Gyeom, time to eat.

(Certificate of Award)

00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:16.635
You scared me!
Why didn't you say you were here?

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:19.605
I was about to, but you got startled
before I had a chance.

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:22.205
Also, I told you to...

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:26.175
turn off that metronome
before you sleep, didn't I?

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:29.015
It helps me focus better when I study.

00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:31.815
(Lee Woo Gyeom gets accepted to
Guam Med School.)

00:02:31.915 --> 00:02:33.315
- Mom.
- Yes?

00:02:33.415 --> 00:02:34.645
Can't we take that down now?

00:02:35.185 --> 00:02:37.355
It's on there just fine.
Why would we take it down?

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:39.625
Have you forgotten that you're the pride
of this neighborhood?

00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:41.525
Come on. The pride of the neighborhood?

00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:46.865
But whenever I come here,
it feels like time stands still.

00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:51.365
That place over there has been closed
for over ten years,

00:02:51.695 --> 00:02:52.905
but it still looks exactly the same.

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:58.535
Sometimes, it's nice
when things don't change.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.175
You think so?

00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:04.545
- Mom, I'm heading out.
- Okay, dear. Be safe.

00:03:04.915 --> 00:03:07.445
Oh, right. The contest results
are announced today, aren't they?

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:11.555
Don't get your hopes up.
I probably didn't get it.

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:14.455
I'm sure you'll get good news,
so just you hurry home.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:18.325
- I'll have a nice meal ready for you.
- Gosh, I told you not to bother.

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:19.865
I'm off.

00:03:23.335 --> 00:03:25.805
That concludes today's lecture.

00:03:26.535 --> 00:03:28.805
- Thank you.
- You too.

00:03:28.865 --> 00:03:29.975
Thank you, Professor.

00:03:30.735 --> 00:03:33.075
Woo Gyeom. Let's go shoot some hoops.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:37.745
Sorry, maybe later. I've got something
I have to finish today.

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:41.645
Gosh, you're relentless.

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:44.385
You always have to remind everyone
you're top of the class, don't you?

00:03:45.955 --> 00:03:46.955
Woo Gyeom.

00:03:47.885 --> 00:03:48.885
Could I have a word with you?

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.565
Our department has finally produced
a true talent.

00:03:55.095 --> 00:03:56.465
You know Professor Han Sang Ho, right?

00:03:57.165 --> 00:04:01.235
He's the world's leading authority
on blood cancer and hematologic diseases.

00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:03.375
Yes, I know of him.

00:04:04.335 --> 00:04:08.305
Professor Han Sang Ho himself
wants to meet you.

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:10.045
We received a call from Chaeum.

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:14.115
No, really, Mom.

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:17.715
Professor Han Sang Ho read my thesis
and asked to see me. I'm telling you.

00:04:20.055 --> 00:04:22.995
See? Didn't I tell you
you'd get good news?

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:26.025
Congratulations! So you'll be home
early tonight, right?

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:30.335
This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance.
I have so many questions to ask him.

00:04:30.935 --> 00:04:32.965
I'm going to the library
to organize my questions first, Mom.

00:04:33.465 --> 00:04:35.405
Okay, but don't be too late.

00:04:35.905 --> 00:04:36.935
I won't.

00:05:00.525 --> 00:05:03.435
(The Final Choice)

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:14.045
Woo Gyeom.

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:16.015
Are you okay?

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:21.285
He's losing too much blood.
He needs a transfusion at a hospital.

00:05:21.915 --> 00:05:22.915
No.

00:05:24.585 --> 00:05:25.655
That probably won't be possible.

00:05:27.485 --> 00:05:28.555
My blood type...

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:30.995
is Rh null.

00:05:31.055 --> 00:05:32.495
(Rh null: Can be donated to anyone,)

00:05:32.595 --> 00:05:34.025
(but can only be received
from Rh null donors)

(Chaeum Medical Group)

00:06:00.925 --> 00:06:01.925
How much longer?

00:06:03.325 --> 00:06:04.925
We'll be there in 20 minutes,
Mr. Chairman.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.265
Director Ahn.

00:06:08.595 --> 00:06:09.595
Sir?

00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:13.065
So...

00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:16.575
What do we do about Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:20.445
- Take him to the lab for the cure and...
- Right.

00:06:22.875 --> 00:06:24.375
I know that's the right thing to do.

00:06:27.285 --> 00:06:30.915
But seeing his disgustingly innocent face,
I'll want to kill him on the spot.

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:31.985
So how am I supposed to do that?

00:06:36.655 --> 00:06:38.055
Don't you have an answer, Director Ahn?

00:06:38.355 --> 00:06:40.825
You've spent your life killing people,
haven't you?

00:06:43.135 --> 00:06:44.135
My apologies, sir.

00:06:47.305 --> 00:06:48.305
Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.775
Will he keep up the act even as he dies?
Or...

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:57.245
Or will he give up
and let his hideous true colors show...

00:06:58.245 --> 00:06:59.845
and beg me to spare his life?

00:07:04.755 --> 00:07:05.885
Either way,

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.755
he's truly an infuriating man.

00:07:11.455 --> 00:07:12.495
Yes, sir.

00:07:12.495 --> 00:07:14.865
If we hadn't taken him in,
forget about finding a cure.

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:18.165
He'd have been found dead
in a ditch somewhere.

00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:21.365
So incredibly ungrateful.

00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:24.835
Don't you agree?

00:07:26.105 --> 00:07:27.105
Yes, absolutely.

00:07:39.625 --> 00:07:41.955
(Internal Report)

00:07:55.365 --> 00:07:56.505
Didn't I tell you
not to put a call through?

00:08:01.875 --> 00:08:03.345
Yes, Attorney General.

00:08:19.525 --> 00:08:20.525
Reporter Jo?

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:24.495
- I'm fine.
- Wait, what happened?

00:08:25.835 --> 00:08:27.635
The people from Chaeum are
after Attorney Park.

00:08:27.935 --> 00:08:28.935
What?

00:08:29.505 --> 00:08:30.875
Why would they be after him?

00:08:31.375 --> 00:08:32.375
It seems...

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:36.075
he helped Lee Woo Gyeom escape.

00:08:36.745 --> 00:08:37.745
What?

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:40.815
You haven't heard from him at all?

00:08:41.385 --> 00:08:43.555
- No.
- What about Prosecutor Cha's team?

00:08:44.215 --> 00:08:47.325
I went to Guam prosecutors this morning
with the files on Assemblyman Baek.

00:08:47.555 --> 00:08:49.255
They're probably questioning him by now.

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:53.425
- Are you okay?
- Go over there and get me the first aid.

00:08:53.495 --> 00:08:54.925
The first aid?

00:09:22.185 --> 00:09:24.525
- Just lie down.
- No, really. I'm okay.

00:09:31.995 --> 00:09:33.005
How's Min Seo?

00:09:42.475 --> 00:09:43.515
Listen, Woo Gyeom.

00:09:44.315 --> 00:09:45.415
Why didn't you...

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.315
tell me everything from the start?
Not just Chairman Chae, but everything.

00:09:51.985 --> 00:09:54.125
Did you forget grabbing me by the collar
the very first time we met?

00:09:56.995 --> 00:09:59.155
And even when you knew
Sang Woo was completely cured,

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.065
you refused to believe me, didn't you?

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:03.965
Back then...

00:10:05.265 --> 00:10:06.265
I know.

00:10:07.905 --> 00:10:10.075
Back then,
all you could think about was Min Seo.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.475
And you probably felt like
there wasn't anyone you could trust.

00:10:15.705 --> 00:10:17.345
But it was the same for me.

00:10:18.345 --> 00:10:21.345
Who would believe a serial killer
who murdered 17 people?

00:10:23.215 --> 00:10:26.155
And who would believe him if he claimed
he could cure the terminally ill?

00:10:27.185 --> 00:10:29.025
Even I would have thought I was a lunatic.

00:10:36.895 --> 00:10:38.395
You're still worried, aren't you?

00:10:39.405 --> 00:10:43.335
That Min Seo might have a relapse someday.

00:10:48.645 --> 00:10:49.645
No.

00:10:53.445 --> 00:10:54.445
I believe you.

00:11:01.985 --> 00:11:04.625
So you finally see
what I'm truly capable of.

00:11:05.555 --> 00:11:08.095
Think how much easier things would've been
if you had just believed me sooner.

00:11:08.325 --> 00:11:11.665
Every time I was in court with you...

00:11:11.935 --> 00:11:13.765
Do you have any idea how frustrated I was?

00:11:16.075 --> 00:11:17.075
Is that so?

00:11:23.475 --> 00:11:24.475
Woo Gyeom.

00:11:30.115 --> 00:11:31.115
Thank you.

00:11:32.515 --> 00:11:33.525
For my Min Seo...

00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:39.095
For saving my Min Seo.

00:11:41.225 --> 00:11:43.365
Come on. Of course.

00:11:44.265 --> 00:11:46.465
I was just doing
what I was supposed to do.

00:11:47.905 --> 00:11:49.475
But Min Seo is really lucky.

00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:52.605
She has such a great dad like you.

00:11:59.415 --> 00:12:00.415
You should...

00:12:02.015 --> 00:12:03.655
get married and have kids of your own.

00:12:04.255 --> 00:12:08.455
Then you'll understand
what it feels like to be a parent.

00:12:13.825 --> 00:12:15.225
Do you think I could get married...

00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:22.265
and have wonderful children like Min Seo?

00:12:28.275 --> 00:12:31.015
- You weren't planning on getting married?
- No, that's not it.

00:12:37.715 --> 00:12:38.755
Are you okay?

00:12:39.985 --> 00:12:41.185
Yes, I'm fine.

00:12:47.195 --> 00:12:48.765
But I should get going.

00:12:50.465 --> 00:12:51.465
Why?

00:12:52.495 --> 00:12:53.865
Chairman Chae will be here soon.

00:13:13.185 --> 00:13:14.385
It's right here, counselor.

00:13:16.555 --> 00:13:19.195
This is where I first committed
to my entire plan.

00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:31.705
After my car accident,

00:13:32.675 --> 00:13:34.705
I was taken to Chaeum Hospital.

00:13:39.415 --> 00:13:40.985
(Son)

00:13:44.385 --> 00:13:46.655
He's an RH null patient in a coma.

00:13:47.325 --> 00:13:48.325
Where is he from?

00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:50.125
He's from Guam, Gyeonggi Province.

00:13:50.695 --> 00:13:52.625
And that's how I met Professor Han.

00:13:53.195 --> 00:13:55.065
This is the patient who was just brought
to the research lab.

00:13:57.595 --> 00:14:02.065
To Chairman Chae Jeong Su,
obsessed with curing the incurable,

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:05.575
I was the best test subject
he could ask for.

00:14:09.145 --> 00:14:11.345
(Patient is negative for all antigens
in the Rh system.)

00:14:11.415 --> 00:14:13.215
(Test results determine
blood type is RH null.)

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:14.945
(Rh null: Can be donated to anyone,)

00:14:15.015 --> 00:14:16.285
(but can only be received
from Rh null donors)

00:14:17.255 --> 00:14:18.255
Proceed.

00:14:27.165 --> 00:14:28.495
(Two weeks later)

00:14:28.565 --> 00:14:29.565
Ma'am.

00:14:29.965 --> 00:14:32.435
It makes things difficult
when you keep coming in like this.

00:14:32.695 --> 00:14:36.975
We're doing all we can to find your son.
We'll be in touch.

00:14:37.035 --> 00:14:40.005
It's been two weeks already
since Woo Gyeom disappeared.

00:14:40.705 --> 00:14:44.875
If you haven't found a single lead,
then please, step up the investigation.

00:14:45.815 --> 00:14:47.285
I'm sure you understand, Ma'am,

00:14:47.345 --> 00:14:51.155
your son's case isn't the only one
we're working on,

00:14:51.315 --> 00:14:52.955
and there's a procedure for these things.

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:56.755
It's all going according to procedure,
so please, just wait.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:14:59.555
Besides, at his age,

00:14:59.725 --> 00:15:03.665
he could've just gone on a trip
with his girlfriend or some friends.

00:15:03.995 --> 00:15:04.995
You understand?

00:15:05.635 --> 00:15:07.365
- Detective...
- We'll be in touch.

00:15:10.005 --> 00:15:12.005
To find her son
who had suddenly disappeared,

00:15:12.835 --> 00:15:15.245
my mother worked tirelessly
day and night...

00:15:16.005 --> 00:15:18.015
and started to retrace my steps.

00:15:18.075 --> 00:15:19.445
(Missing son)

Even when the outcome was uncertain.

00:15:32.855 --> 00:15:34.595
My mother never stopped.

00:15:51.775 --> 00:15:54.245
(Missing son)

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:03.425
(Last seen:
Road near Guam University Central Library)

00:16:04.195 --> 00:16:06.525
Ma'am, we've found your son.

00:16:06.995 --> 00:16:10.935
He was the victim of a hit-and-run
and was taken to the hospital,

00:16:11.365 --> 00:16:13.235
but they couldn't identify him
at the time,

00:16:13.605 --> 00:16:17.175
so they say he was cremated,
and his ashes were interred at a facility.

00:16:18.475 --> 00:16:20.575
To use me as a test subject,

00:16:20.975 --> 00:16:24.345
Chaeum colluded with law enforcement
to falsely report my death.

00:16:24.915 --> 00:16:27.385
A few months after
she was told I had died,

00:16:27.915 --> 00:16:30.085
my mother, after endless inquiries,

00:16:30.585 --> 00:16:33.385
found the dashcam footage
that captured my accident.

00:16:42.865 --> 00:16:44.765
- Yes, that's the student.
- What?

00:16:45.065 --> 00:16:47.735
When we arrived, he was unconscious,
so we transported him to the hospital.

00:16:47.905 --> 00:16:50.035
And my route on the day of the accident,

00:16:50.605 --> 00:16:53.705
and even testimonies from those
who transported me to Chaeum Hospital.

00:16:54.575 --> 00:16:59.245
She began piecing the truth together,
to prepare a lawsuit against Chaeum.

00:16:59.315 --> 00:17:01.315
(Public Petitions Office)

00:17:01.385 --> 00:17:03.385

(At the time of the accident,
my son had his belongings and cell phone.)

00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:29.305
There were others at the Chaeum Institute,
unclaimed, with fake identities like me.

00:17:32.075 --> 00:17:34.915
And to keep the truth from getting out...

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:50.835
Eventually, Chairman Chae
even came after my mother.

00:18:26.465 --> 00:18:30.205
And when Professor Han, who long led
the incurable disease research,

00:18:30.835 --> 00:18:32.735
failed to produce any significant results,

00:18:34.605 --> 00:18:36.975
Chairman Chae,
feeling the pressure from investors,

00:18:37.375 --> 00:18:39.375
brought in a new research team.

00:18:40.185 --> 00:18:42.745
And to prevent Professor Han
from leaking any research data,

00:18:43.515 --> 00:18:45.415
he started having him watched
very closely.

00:18:48.985 --> 00:18:51.595
Then, I miraculously woke up
during an experiment.

00:18:51.795 --> 00:18:54.595
And Professor Han, unable to take
the pressure from Chairman Chae,

00:18:54.895 --> 00:18:56.735
ended up escaping with me.

00:18:56.995 --> 00:18:57.995
Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:19:02.035 --> 00:19:05.405
You need to lay low for a while
until I find an investor.

00:19:06.305 --> 00:19:08.375
It won't take long, so just trust me.

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:13.045
I'll see this through to the end
and make sure you get cured.

00:19:32.235 --> 00:19:33.235
Woo Gyeom.

00:19:34.365 --> 00:19:36.365
Where have you been?

00:19:37.175 --> 00:19:38.605
Do you have any idea how worried I was?

00:19:47.145 --> 00:19:48.145

What's the deal
between you and Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:36.125
About a week before he was arrested?
Lee Woo Gyeom contacted me directly.

00:21:37.425 --> 00:21:39.795
At first, I thought he was a lunatic too.

00:21:40.365 --> 00:21:43.365
But when a survivor shows up
right in front of you...

00:21:44.165 --> 00:21:46.435

wasn't me. It was Chairman Chae.

for the terminally ill patients
around the world waiting for the cure?

00:26:43.465 --> 00:26:46.365
This is no time for you two
to be acting like this.

A father who throws everything away
just to save his one daughter...

00:26:53.275 --> 00:26:57.315

It's pathetic, really.

00:27:01.885 --> 00:27:03.785
Woo Gyeom!

00:27:10.725 --> 00:27:13.455
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Mr. Shin Ho Chang?

00:27:14.095 --> 00:27:17.365
I said, "What are you doing?"
What? What? You son of a gun.

00:27:19.195 --> 00:27:22.965
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry? You're sorry?

00:27:39.615 --> 00:27:41.255

I can barely stop myself from killing him
right this second...

00:27:54.465 --> 00:27:56.965
So why would you harm a test subject
whose life is already hanging by a thread?

00:27:57.275 --> 00:27:58.275
Why?

00:28:08.515 --> 00:28:09.815
Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom, are you all right?

00:28:10.655 --> 00:28:12.715
I'm so sorry.
My team made a terrible mistake.

00:28:13.825 --> 00:28:14.825
I'm truly sorry.

00:28:16.925 --> 00:28:17.955

00:28:21.525 --> 00:28:24.295
Everyone makes mistakes from time to time.

00:28:24.665 --> 00:28:27.205
Just like everything you've done to me
up until now.

00:28:28.465 --> 00:28:31.335
Let's forgive and forget.
Let's focus on the bigger picture now.

00:28:32.505 --> 00:28:33.505
Just like we did at the start.

00:28:35.575 --> 00:28:39.145
Let's go back to Chaeum and start over.

00:28:40.315 --> 00:28:45.015
So patients with incurable diseases
can get a new lease on life.

00:29:15.585 --> 00:29:17.715
How many people do you have to save
to make it all okay?

00:29:18.955 --> 00:29:22.585
How many more do we have to save
to undo what you've done?

00:29:23.925 --> 00:29:26.695
Have you ever considered saving more lives
than the ones you took?

00:29:27.795 --> 00:29:29.395
You're not supposed to be like this.

00:29:30.865 --> 00:29:34.135
Of all people, you should know better
than to do this.

00:30:04.835 --> 00:30:07.095
That list of test subjects
Professor Han had.

00:30:07.565 --> 00:30:09.365
You were the one who had it, weren't you?

00:30:11.575 --> 00:30:12.575
Still, what a relief.

00:30:13.075 --> 00:30:14.745
That's the property of Chaeum, you know.

00:30:16.175 --> 00:30:17.945
Why are you going to such lengths?

00:30:18.645 --> 00:30:20.985
You were a victim of your own father too.

00:30:22.315 --> 00:30:24.955
You know the feeling of being
experimented on, so why?

00:30:26.055 --> 00:30:27.055
A victim?

00:30:30.285 --> 00:30:31.755
I'm not a victim.

00:30:34.195 --> 00:30:36.565
You seem to be misunderstanding something,
Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

(Chaeum Medical Center)

00:31:13.065 --> 00:31:17.635
The experiment is progressing,
but we lack a suitable test subject, so...

00:31:35.585 --> 00:31:36.585
I...

00:31:37.995 --> 00:31:40.765
I chose to become a test subject.

00:31:41.865 --> 00:31:43.565
The son becomes the ingredient,

00:31:44.095 --> 00:31:46.565
and the father researches a cure.

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:51.405
An age will come
when Chaeum controls life and death.

00:31:53.375 --> 00:31:57.375
Don't you see what a great honor it is
to be a test subject?

00:32:08.555 --> 00:32:09.555
Isn't that magnificent?

00:32:10.125 --> 00:32:11.855
A challenge no one has ever accomplished.

00:32:12.255 --> 00:32:16.865
It started with Chaeum's first chairman,
my father, Professor Chae Jeong Hun.

00:32:16.865 --> 00:32:18.465
And we're almost there, Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:32:18.865 --> 00:32:20.195
The day we can use your blood...

00:32:21.235 --> 00:32:24.205
and Chaeum's technology
to create the cure...

00:32:26.175 --> 00:32:30.005
and show the world Chaeum's greatness.
That day is almost here!

00:32:37.315 --> 00:32:38.315
Woo Gyeom.

00:32:53.695 --> 00:32:56.435
Woo Gyeom. Don't. Just stop, okay?

00:32:57.975 --> 00:32:59.505
He can't get away with this.

00:33:01.405 --> 00:33:02.545
If I don't stop him now,

00:33:03.175 --> 00:33:05.515
- there will be more monsters like me.
- Woo Gyeom!

00:33:07.645 --> 00:33:09.245
I'll handle this. You should leave, sir.

00:33:47.485 --> 00:33:48.485
Stop.

00:34:02.465 --> 00:34:04.335
You're a little late today, Prosecutor.

00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:06.305
That's enough now.

00:34:07.075 --> 00:34:09.445
We already have testimony about
Chairman Chae's illegal experiments,

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:10.645
- It's all right, Prosecutor Cha.
- so...

00:34:13.515 --> 00:34:15.345
It's already too late for me as well.

00:34:25.125 --> 00:34:26.195

I know how wronged you feel.
How furious you are.

00:34:53.255 --> 00:34:54.285
I know it all too well.

00:34:55.925 --> 00:34:59.125
This time, I swear I'll do
whatever it takes to save you.

00:35:01.525 --> 00:35:02.525
So please, let's stop.

00:35:04.395 --> 00:35:05.395
For both our sakes,

00:35:07.265 --> 00:35:09.035
this is just too much, man.

00:35:34.225 --> 00:35:36.065
Please take good care of my lawyer for me.

during the arrest of Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:37:06.355 --> 00:37:10.325
and that they had to discharge a firearm
to secure the scene.

00:37:10.385 --> 00:37:11.695
(Chairman Chae Jeong Su
arrested at the scene.)

00:37:11.855 --> 00:37:16.365
Additionally, Chairman Chae Jeong Su
of the Chaeum Medical Group was arrested.

00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:19.365
An investigation is underway into his role
in leading illegal medical experiments...

00:37:19.865 --> 00:37:23.635
and his attempts to cover up
the resulting patient deaths.

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.425
I'm Cha Yi Yeon
from Criminal Division one.

00:37:43.955 --> 00:37:48.165
This case involves illegal medical crimes
that were perpetrated for years,

00:37:48.425 --> 00:37:51.135
by gambling with the lives
of nameless victims.

00:37:53.665 --> 00:37:55.935
Lee Woo Gyeom asked me
to give this to you.

00:38:00.775 --> 00:38:01.775
What is this?

00:38:03.845 --> 00:38:05.715
Counselor, take this.

00:38:10.315 --> 00:38:11.915
Chairman Chae and Professor Han
experimented...

00:38:12.555 --> 00:38:14.585
on people with no kin and killed them.

00:38:15.725 --> 00:38:19.225
This is the personal information
of those 223 victims.

00:38:21.525 --> 00:38:24.495
To date, the number of deaths at
the Chaeum Medical research institute...

00:38:24.495 --> 00:38:26.165
has reached a staggering total of 223.

00:38:26.365 --> 00:38:29.735
In response, the Prosecution
has arrested all parties...

00:38:30.035 --> 00:38:33.735
who committed these unforgivable crimes
under the shadow of money and power.

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:37.915
We promise to enforce the law
without a shred of leniency.

00:38:42.345 --> 00:38:43.345
Makes it all worthwhile.

00:38:54.225 --> 00:38:56.695
Where are you headed today,
Prosecutor Cha?

00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:00.895
Since I received something
from Lee Woo Gyeom,

00:39:01.935 --> 00:39:04.165
I feel I should go pay my respects.

00:39:04.635 --> 00:39:06.735
You two should head home early
and get some rest today.

00:39:06.805 --> 00:39:09.745
No, that's okay.
We must first identify the victims...

00:39:09.805 --> 00:39:10.805
Prosecutor Cha.

00:39:11.375 --> 00:39:12.615
Let's go this way. This way.

00:39:12.915 --> 00:39:16.145
- The entrance is full of reporters.
- Seriously.

00:39:16.215 --> 00:39:17.715
It'll be a pain
if the reporters catch you.

00:39:19.885 --> 00:39:21.685
(Guam District Prosecutors' Office,
Public Service Center)

00:39:23.925 --> 00:39:24.925
Prosecutor Cha.

00:39:26.295 --> 00:39:28.095
Get home safe. We'll see you tomorrow.

00:39:57.795 --> 00:40:00.395
We've secured both witnesses and evidence.

00:40:00.995 --> 00:40:02.065
So why on earth?

00:40:02.995 --> 00:40:06.435
Why are you still protecting Chairman Chae
to the very end?

00:40:06.865 --> 00:40:07.865
Why?

00:40:11.405 --> 00:40:14.005
The Chaeum case,
the one Baek bribed me to ignore...

00:40:15.075 --> 00:40:17.875
is on a whole other level
than what you're imagining.

00:40:20.475 --> 00:40:21.545
Hey, Oh Hyeon Deuk.

00:40:22.385 --> 00:40:23.945
Have you lost your mind?

00:40:27.455 --> 00:40:31.795
You backstabbing son of a gun!
Did you forget who made you what you are?

00:40:31.995 --> 00:40:35.225
Did you?
You think I'm going to let this slide?

00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:37.835
Let go!

00:40:38.695 --> 00:40:39.695
Let go of me!

00:40:44.365 --> 00:40:46.075
I'll tell you everything.

00:40:47.135 --> 00:40:48.545
About Chairman Chae and Assemblyman Baek.

00:40:48.875 --> 00:40:51.915
The start of the Lee Woo Gyeom incidents,
the people involved,

00:40:53.015 --> 00:40:55.345
and every single thing you suspect,
down to the last detail.

00:40:59.285 --> 00:41:01.685
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:41:03.025 --> 00:41:04.285
I heard you met with Chief Pyo.

00:41:05.195 --> 00:41:06.595
You must have a rough idea then.

00:41:08.295 --> 00:41:09.425
Chairman Cha.

00:41:10.725 --> 00:41:11.735
Your father...

00:41:12.695 --> 00:41:13.895
asked me to tell you...

00:41:15.365 --> 00:41:16.705
to stop here.

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:19.375
Director Oh.

00:41:20.435 --> 00:41:21.475
I...

00:41:22.075 --> 00:41:25.375
I'm not a three-year-old child
who has to listen to her dad.

00:41:26.445 --> 00:41:28.885
If I were going to do this half-heartedly,
I never would've started.

00:41:30.185 --> 00:41:33.415
From now on, just tell me the facts,
exactly like you are now.

00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:38.325
Whoever was involved, whatever they did...
Don't leave a single thing out.

00:41:41.625 --> 00:41:42.625
All right.

00:41:43.525 --> 00:41:46.195
Then I'll start recording now.

00:41:54.335 --> 00:41:55.345
Yi Yeon.

00:42:26.975 --> 00:42:28.845
If anything should happen to me,

00:42:31.975 --> 00:42:34.345
open the metronome in my studio.

00:42:35.615 --> 00:42:38.285
Inside, you'll find the first treatment
I ever developed.

00:42:42.085 --> 00:42:44.125
The choice is now yours, Counselor.

00:42:47.125 --> 00:42:49.125
Whether developing the final treatment...

00:42:49.865 --> 00:42:51.895
to save countless lives...

00:42:53.335 --> 00:42:56.805
Or if that in turn will cause
countless deaths...

00:42:58.375 --> 00:43:00.105
is something no one on Earth
can possibly know.

00:43:15.785 --> 00:43:18.195
(No caller ID)

00:43:23.565 --> 00:43:25.695
- Hello?
- It's me.

00:43:35.105 --> 00:43:36.105
I trust you've been well.

00:43:40.245 --> 00:43:41.245
Counselor.

00:43:41.245 --> 00:43:43.015
