WEBVTT

00:00:15.815 --> 00:00:16.849
He doesn't have a mom!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:17.751
For real?

00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:20.520
You're the ones acting like
you weren't raised right.

00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:26.492
Get up.

00:00:26.493 --> 00:00:28.528
Let's be friends.

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:33.400
I'm Jaeyeon.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.982
What if I don't get into college?

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.351
How did you end up with a score like that?

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.685
I don't know...

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.088
I think I totally screwed up the last page.

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.057
It's okay.

00:00:57.058 --> 00:00:59.591
You'll do better next time.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:00.759
It's not that you're not good enough.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.796
You just made a mistake.

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:22.381
We've been friends since we were kids.

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.084
And somehow, we're still friends now...

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.152
It's honestly exhausting.

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.456
I guess we're stuck
together until we're a hundred.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.223
Yeah.

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:32.424
Even when we're old men,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.792
we'll still be friends.

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.428
Yeah.

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:31.784
You could at least look at me.

00:02:42.095 --> 00:02:44.029
Geonwoo.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.230
Are you... are you okay?

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:47.534
What... what's happening?

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:53.740
You're okay...

00:02:54.541 --> 00:02:56.543
You're going to be fine...

00:02:58.378 --> 00:02:59.946
Geonwoo?

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.916
Geonwoo, wake up!

00:03:04.851 --> 00:03:05.851
Geonwoo...!

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:08.221
Geonwoo... Geonwoo...

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:14.928
No... no... this can't be happening...

00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:16.929
Geon... Geonwoo...

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.132
Geonwoo... Geonwoo!

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.366
What am I going to do...

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:23.403
GEONWOO!!!

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.739
Why are you being so loud...

00:03:29.742 --> 00:03:32.679
You're... you're alive?

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.181
Would you be happier if I weren't?

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:38.083
How can you say that?

00:03:38.084 --> 00:03:39.785
You think this is a joke?

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:42.422
You just got out of surgery...

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:45.525
At least it wasn't any worse...

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.295
No... I mean...

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:53.199
What if you got one of
your organ's knicked?

00:03:55.535 --> 00:03:57.135
I'll stay with you tonight.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.571
- I'll watch over you..
- No, it's fine.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.474
He said he'd do it.

00:04:04.844 --> 00:04:08.248
What was the point of all
the effort I put into raising you?

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.760
Thank you.

00:04:21.361 --> 00:04:22.894
For what?

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:25.331
Anyway... are you okay?

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:28.534
Oh!

00:04:29.302 --> 00:04:30.569
Oh no.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.705
What's wrong? Are you okay?

00:04:32.805 --> 00:04:34.674
Can you give me a hug?

00:04:42.181 --> 00:04:44.417
To be honest, it doesn't even hurt.

00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.088
Are you serious?!

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:51.157
You scared the life out of me...

00:04:52.592 --> 00:04:54.260
I just wanted a hug.

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:56.829
What do you mean...

00:05:04.771 --> 00:05:06.572
Why are your eyes closed?

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.142
Me...?

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.978
Just...

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.000
