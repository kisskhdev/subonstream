00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.399
I didn't go looking for you,

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:51.399
yet you showed up at my door yourself.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.600
Tell me.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.920
What exactly do you know?

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.799
That fire wasn't an accident,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.479
was it?

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.719
It's been ten years, hasn't it?

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:03.520
And only now you decide to seek the truth.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.920
Some truths,

00:01:06.239 --> 00:01:07.680
even if burned to ashes,

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.680
are cleaner than the bloody remnants.

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:12.000
What do you mean?

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.920
What exactly do you know?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.959
In three days,

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.599
bring your cue.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.159
Win a game,

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:21.519
get an answer.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.000
Fine.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.599
Even if I have to bet my life,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.840
I'll play to the end.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.560
I like that.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.920
Some gamblers

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.120
always think they can turn the tables.

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.080
Bet it all.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.719
He's here.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.439
Finally here.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.680
Distinguished guests,

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.560
good evening.

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:30.840
Welcome to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.919
this billiards-themed luxury yacht.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.360
For the next three days and two nights,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.800
everyone

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.280
will enjoy a wonderful time.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.520
Oh, by the way,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.240
for tonight's billiards match,

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.759
we have specially invited the

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:46.000
genius billiards player from ten years ago,

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.240
the Triple Crown Champion,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.520
Cheng Ye.

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.159
That's Cheng Ye?

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.120
Yeah.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.520
Wasn't he banned from competing?

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:54.280
Why is Cheng Ye here?

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.159
Why is he here?

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.680
Let's go take a look.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.599
He's really amazing.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.240
By the way,

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.639
our Triple Crown Champion, Cheng Ye,

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:13.719
has another identity now.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.400
That is...

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:18.480
a delivery man,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.759
Black Eight.

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:22.959
It really is the Triple Crown Champion, Cheng Ye.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.759
He's making a comeback.

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:25.160
No way.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.519
Did he fail at delivering takeout

00:04:26.519 --> 00:04:27.680
and come back to play pool?

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.079
The pool world isn't easy to survive in now.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.519
It's been ten years. Is he still any good?

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.920
Who knows?

00:04:34.079 --> 00:04:34.879
Maybe.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:46.399
Bosses,

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.920
the betting is open.

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.240
I'll kick things off for you bosses.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.480
Ten million.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:55.040
I bet Black Eight loses.

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:01.319
Feel free to place your bets.

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.000
Good.

00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:03.439
I'll match that.

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:12.720
Let's play something interesting.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:14.600
Whoever rolls the lowest number

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.399
breaks first.

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:17.519
Pool relies on skill,

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.120
not luck.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.319
Well said.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:24.680
Too bad, though.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.920
The rules here

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:28.759
are up to me.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.480
Guess what I rolled.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.240
There are six dice in total.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.439
The lowest possible roll should be six, right?

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:57.839
Jiu Ge never misses.

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.560
Then Jiu Ge definitely wins.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.399
One.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.319
Amazing!

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:05.279
As expected of Jiu Ge.

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:06.399
What's the point of competing?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.120
With Jiu Ge taking the break,

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.360
he can finish him off instantly.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.800
Still struggling in vain?

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.480
No matter how you shake it,

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.040
you can't shake out The Pillar Stack.

00:06:32.079 --> 00:06:32.839
In such a hurry?

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:34.879
You didn't even look at the dice

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:35.879
before getting ready to break.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.519
It's not that I look down on you,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.600
but you can't even roll a six,

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.480
let alone The Pillar Stack.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.879
That's way too impressive!

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:53.839
He actually shattered them!

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:55.360
That strength is insane!

00:06:55.439 --> 00:06:56.720
He can even shatter dice!

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:58.439
The dice are broken.

00:06:58.759 --> 00:06:59.480
This round doesn't count.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.319
You only said whoever has the lower points wins.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.160
You didn't say we couldn't break the dice.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.519
Everyone here can testify for me.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.839
So, you have one point.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.920
I have zero points.

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:17.240
You lose.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.079
I break.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:38.800
Beautiful!

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.160
Two stripes down right off the break.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:40.639
Two stripes down right off the break.

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:41.600
Without a doubt,

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.920
he'll definitely choose stripes.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.519
The layout is complicated now.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.680
The other four stripes are frozen to the cushion,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.560
and they're in a death grip with four solids.

00:07:52.079 --> 00:07:53.639
This game is really high difficulty.

00:08:05.079 --> 00:08:06.240
He has to play defense on this shot.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.040
There's no shot to make.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.040
Truly worthy of being the Triple Crown Champion.

00:08:21.879 --> 00:08:23.519
That was truly a stroke of genius.

00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:24.639
This ten ball...

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:26.000
after two caroms,

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:27.720
he cut it right in!

00:08:29.399 --> 00:08:30.360
All in! All in! All in!

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:31.519
Raise the stakes!

00:08:32.519 --> 00:08:33.159
Raise the stakes!

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:34.759
This shot...

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.879
I think he's going to clear the table.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:37.799
This kid...

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:38.600
has skills.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.320
Worthy of being the Ball King.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.720
Exactly.

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:50.519
An extreme bank shot!

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840
He's got god-like vision!

00:08:51.919 --> 00:08:53.080
A champion is a champion.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:54.440
Ten years have passed,

00:08:54.559 --> 00:08:55.759
and his skills are still top-notch.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.519
Yeah.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:57.679
This problem-solving strategy

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:58.759
is enough for us to study for a year.

00:08:58.879 --> 00:08:59.919
Is he really going to clear the table?

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:00.679
You're bluffing.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.240
Didn't you see the position of the 8-ball?

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:04.120
If this shot knocks the 8-ball in,

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.559
Black Eight loses.

00:09:06.159 --> 00:09:08.240
When I bet on Black Eight earlier,

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.240
why didn't I notice the 8-ball's position?

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.240
Bet too early, huh?

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.080
I saw the 8-ball's position long ago.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.320
This is a dead end.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.200
No one can solve this.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.320
How does it feel to dig your own grave?

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.159
The 8-ball is blocked so tightly.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:26.600
Even if it goes in,

00:09:28.159 --> 00:09:29.679
at best it's a draw.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.279
After all that effort,

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.360
do you really think you are Black Eight?

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.480
Just

00:09:48.159 --> 00:09:49.519
playing tricks.

00:10:08.759 --> 00:10:09.600
That actually worked?!

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:11.600
Magic!

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.480
What magic?

00:10:14.879 --> 00:10:15.639
Physics.

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.480
Bernoulli's principle.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:18.840
What principle?

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.399
Celestial Six Styles: Wind Blade.

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.360
Wow.

00:10:30.919 --> 00:10:31.600
Magic.

00:10:32.159 --> 00:10:32.879
Physics.

00:10:33.759 --> 00:10:36.360
The cue ball's spin generates a wind blade,

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:39.080
which, without touching the ball,

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:42.080
can move the target ball's position.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.759
Brilliant!

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:49.679
Brilliant!

00:10:50.039 --> 00:10:51.320
Truly brilliant!

00:10:51.399 --> 00:10:52.399
Two balls in one shot!

00:10:53.159 --> 00:10:54.120
Thank you, Boss Jiang.

00:10:54.679 --> 00:10:55.879
Sorry for making you spend so much.

00:10:57.879 --> 00:10:59.279
This was truly

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:00.639
a good match.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.440
Is this also physics?

00:11:19.919 --> 00:11:20.559
What law is it?

00:11:20.919 --> 00:11:21.279
This...

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:22.159
I don't understand either.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.080
I thought there'd be a more novel playing style.

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.159
It was the last ball.

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:33.000
He just had to show off.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.679
Aren't you afraid of pushing your luck?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.639
Luckily, the last ball went in.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.200
What are you showing off for?

00:11:40.159 --> 00:11:41.279
Now you can tell me...

00:11:41.279 --> 00:11:42.200
...the truth about Wei Wei.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.200
You want to know the truth after winning just one game?

00:11:44.799 --> 00:11:45.799
Do you know the rules?

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.200
Best of three.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.840
But next...

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.320
You won't win again.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.200
Is this the surprise you prepared specially for me?

00:12:02.759 --> 00:12:03.200
Boss Nan.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.399
Boss Nan.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.080
Quiet.

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:13.360
Eyes, one hundred thousand.

00:12:14.039 --> 00:12:14.840
Liver...

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:15.759
Fifty.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.279
Lungs, seventy.

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:18.799
Heart, one million.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.039
Ten million US dollars.

00:12:23.559 --> 00:12:25.559
To pay this off with your life...

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:28.120
It would take thirty lifetimes.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.559
What will you pay with?

00:12:31.759 --> 00:12:32.240
Boss Nan.

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:32.919
Boss Nan.

00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:34.679
I...

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:56.759
Hello?

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:57.759
Brilliant.

00:12:57.759 --> 00:12:58.720
Truly brilliant.

00:12:58.759 --> 00:12:59.440
Boss Jiang.

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:01.960
I want to add another ten million dollars on the next match.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.960
I've already had someone send the chips over.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:06.080
The Triple Crown Champion is indeed the Triple Crown Champion.

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:08.000
I didn't expect that after ten years without playing...

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.080
...he's still so formidable.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.120
It's really surprising.

00:13:11.279 --> 00:13:12.240
Alright, Boss Sun.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.759
Have a pleasant trip.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.519
Come.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:22.639
Business is here.

00:13:23.399 --> 00:13:25.480
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.200
Make sure you seize it.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:30.159
U-Understood, Boss Nan.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:30.799
This time...

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.679
I absolutely won't let any accidents happen.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.879
If you dare let him win again...

00:13:36.399 --> 00:13:39.440
I will make you disappear from this world completely.
