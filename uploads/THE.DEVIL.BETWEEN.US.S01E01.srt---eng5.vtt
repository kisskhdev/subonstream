Tan Jie, follow him.

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:19.560
Wu,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.530
Ding Lai is heading your way.

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.410
What are you doing here?

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.920
Looking for someone.

00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:58.150
Which room?

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.040
8401.

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.530
It's upstairs.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:33.500
Who's it?

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.070
I'm Wishes Come True.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.630
Hello.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:47.720
You're...

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.840
Great Luck 2016?

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:51.720
We talked on the forum.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.460
Take off your mask.

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:55.240
Mask!

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:13.990
Where's the money?

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.850
I...

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.260
Where's the thing I want?

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.190
Money first,

00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:31.530
then the goods.

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:34.610
I already transferred
30,000 to you online.

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:36.440
For the remaining 70,000,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.550
we agreed on

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:39.440
cash on delivery.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:19.660
Money first,

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.910
then the goods.

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:37.640
70,000.

00:12:44.890 --> 00:12:46.680
Can I see the goods then?

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:55.690
He just went to the restroom.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:56.950
Everything is normal.

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.960
How are things with you?

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.000
Transferred to the City Bureau?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:02.790
Just finished the exam.

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.860
I'm waiting for results.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:05.450
Dai doesn't really want to let me go.

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:06.480
I said it's for the kids,

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.650
so he can't really argue, right?

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:08.560
But I think

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.670
you're just causing yourself
unnecessary trouble.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:12.550
With those two little terrors of yours

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:13.240
being so wild,

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.000
always acting up,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.120
do you think a school in the city

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:16.480
can handle them?

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:17.440
They can't.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:17.840
Then where?

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:18.510
You should just

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:20.630
move straight to the provincial capital.

00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:22.150
Send them to an international school.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:23.790
I really regret it now.

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.390
I should have left back then.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.320
If I had gone abroad,

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.240
wouldn't I be better off than now?

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.030
Here we go again.

00:13:29.030 --> 00:13:29.870
Just think about it.

00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:31.360
Even if I were washing dishes abroad,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.070
I'd feel my life had purpose.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:34.910
Washing dishes, really?

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.600
Let her try a couple of days
at our electronics factory.

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.970
She definitely wouldn't
be able to handle it.

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.250
That's true.

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.750
But regarding your online business,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:41.790
it doesn't matter

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:42.870
whether you're here or abroad.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.120
Don't you just operate it
on your phone anyway?

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.120
Besides, you make so much money
from this business, right?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:47.950
This meal is on you.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:48.670
The next one is on you too.

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.480
The next one is still on her.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.910
It's on you forever.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:51.840
No problem.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840
It's all on me.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:53.410
Great.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.790
Why isn't anyone here yet?

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.050
What's the rush?

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.010
What are you doing?

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.620
Still can't get it out?

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:22.600
What's taking you so long?

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.660
What are you doing?

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:30.190
Where's the thing I want?

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.000
Right here.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.200
Just smuggled from abroad.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.050
Untraceable.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.010
Very safe.

00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:38.920
I just want a kidney.

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.020
This is a whole person.

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:42.750
Alive.

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:44.390
Two kidneys.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:45.670
Fresh.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:53.800
Take it!

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.720
I'm sorry.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:56.290
I'm sorry.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:56.840
I...

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:58.940
I'm sorry.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:59.270
I'm sorry.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.330
What are you doing?

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:02.130
I'm sorry.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:03.240
I...

00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:04.320
I don't want it anymore.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.650
Can you give me my money back?

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.320
You think you're buying pork
at the market?

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.360
You can refuse it.

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:09.610
Leave the money,

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:10.480
and get lost.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.410
Sir,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:14.560
please listen to me.

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:15.480
This is all the money I have.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.270
I'm using this money

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.640
to save my child's life.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.540
Can you help me?

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.790
I really am...

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:25.340
Cut it.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:26.190
Do you dare?

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:30.390
I do.

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:32.110
But there is a problem.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:33.200
I have to go out now.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.130
I'll deal with this when I get back.

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:36.230
How long?

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:38.450
Watch her for me.

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:39.440
Until I get back,

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.670
if anything happens to her,

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:41.930
I'll stab you to death!

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.700
About what time?

00:15:56.630 --> 00:15:58.030
I know you two mean well.

00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.960
But I think Wang An

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.720
will definitely pass the exam this year.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.630
The key is, Wang An needs

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.510
his own independent life,

00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:04.270
and so do you.

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.630
Really, think about it.

00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:09.360
To be independent,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.290
start by dating.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:11.840
Look over there.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.130
Don't look together.

00:16:14.130 --> 00:16:14.990
You look first.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:17.790
See him?

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.170
That jawline

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:20.460
is so sharp.

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:21.480
Go ask for his WeChat.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.360
He's too skinny.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.790
I could punch right through him.

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.080
Why do you always think about fighting?

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.080
I'm just saying.

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:29.020
Let's go.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:29.700
Retreat.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:30.330
Sir,

00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.280
looks like he's here.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.550
All units, attention.

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.130
Suspected target has appeared.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:41.240
When will backup arrive?

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.170
Still on the way.

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.420
Ensure public safety during the arrest.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.570
-Copy that.
-Copy that.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.030
Target in sight.

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.600
You go if you're so brave.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.480
Just go ask for it.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.630
I'm not going. I don't dare.

00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:05.640
What are you afraid of?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.440
Nobody move!

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:08.550
The goods must be in the bag.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.290
Wait for him to hand the bag to Ding Lai.

00:17:10.290 --> 00:17:11.770
There's a sudden problem.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:12.869
The mule has constipation.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.470
I gave her lots of laxatives.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.310
She just can't poop it out.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:15.880
I'll go!

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.030
It's just asking for his WeChat.

00:17:17.030 --> 00:17:17.790
Look at her.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:19.550
Emergency.

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:20.720
A woman is approaching.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.480
One hour.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:22.550
Hello, excuse me.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:24.410
My friend wants to ask for your...

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.600
Why did she stop?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.440
Get down!

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:38.640
Hurry!

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.110
Get down!

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.350
Get down!

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:40.350
Ding Lai has a gun!

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:41.750
Go, go, go!

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:46.000
Go!

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:46.460
Freeze!

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.510
Don't move. Stay still!

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.480
Be careful!

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.930
Wenjing!

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.560
Watch him!

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:55.960
Freeze!

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:12.750
Get down!

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:17.650
Turn over!

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:22.210
Wake up.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.000
Call an ambulance.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:26.360
Hungry!

00:18:26.380 --> 00:18:27.310
I'm hungry!

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:29.380
Xiaoyu is hungry!

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:40.290
I'm hungry.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:10.560
Move!

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:11.220
Stop!

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.000
Move!

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.000
Out of the way!

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:32.790
Move!

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:34.790
Out of the way!

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:44.950
Move!

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.290
Stop!

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.910
I'll shoot if you move!

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.800
Are you okay?

00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:17.630
I'm from the County PSB. Where is he?

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:18.490
He ran that way.

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.380
After him.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.580
Where is he?

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:24.310
Over there. Go!

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.790
Guard him!

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:25.350
Call an ambulance!

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.000
Chase him!

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:26.960
Are you okay?

00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:28.870
Freeze!

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.090
Stop running!

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:34.960
Stop!

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.880
Freeze!

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:38.830
Freeze!

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.550
Run!

00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:45.390
Freeze!

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:48.400
He has a gun!

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.270
Let's go!

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:20.970
Jin.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:21.920
Split up!

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.120
Stop!

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.030
Police! Freeze!

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.230
I'll shoot if you run!

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:54.610
Warning shot!

00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:10.480
Let's go!

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.890
Freeze!

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:47.950
Jin.

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:48.870
Jin.

00:22:49.230 --> 00:22:49.840
Jin.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.280
All units,

00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:57.510
residential area north of the mall.

00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:58.350
Jin is down.

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.240
All units!

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:01.630
Now!

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.060
Come in.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:17.970
Dad.

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:19.190
Come in.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:20.260
You come in first.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:22.880
Dad.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.160
Who is she?

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:26.080
Jiajia,

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:27.510
go to your room first.

00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:28.800
I'll talk to you later.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:30.920
Take your doll and go.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:32.150
Go inside.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:33.860
Good girl.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.000
Put on your headphones

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.260
and practice that song.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.260
My tummy hurts.

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.880
Poo-poo.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.610
What?

00:23:47.310 --> 00:23:48.350
Poo-poo.

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.590
Tummy hurts? You need to poop?

00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:51.510
Poo-poo.

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:52.350
This way.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:52.920
Come on.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:53.540
Over here.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.030
Here.

00:25:50.250 --> 00:25:52.100
Xiaoyu wants meat.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:55.810
I want meat.

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.180
I want meat!

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.310
Meat.

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.440
I want...

00:26:21.530 --> 00:26:22.790
Still can't get it out?

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:24.840
What's taking you so long?

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.980
[Dai Kangren, Deputy Director,
Nuanfeng County PSB, Haizhou City]

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:51.480
Director Dai is here.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.370
I gotta go.

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.240
Director Dai.

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.080
You heard those gunshots.

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:00.720
There was one shot.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.450
Officer Jin Longfeng hit a suspect.

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.250
But we're not sure
if it was Ding Lai or Liu Yi.

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:09.420
Officer Jin Longfeng died.

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:11.880
He must have fallen down the stairs,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.960
breaking his neck.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.430
Probably Ding Lai's doing.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:20.220
It had to be Ding Lai.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:22.070
Director Dai,

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.670
you have to help us.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.440
Sure.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.370
Our entire bureau is mobilized.

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:27.970
We have every hospital,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:28.730
pharmacy,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:30.160
and major road

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:31.550
in the county under watch.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:32.850
One of them is injured.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.280
They can't hide for long.

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.140
Hu Wenjing,

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:36.580
why were you there?

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:37.460
It's a City Bureau case.

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:38.770
We were assisting the arrest.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:39.830
They only sent two people,

00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:41.310
and now this happens. You're telling me

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:42.110
Jin died just like that.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.550
Are you responsible?

00:27:42.550 --> 00:27:43.420
Our colleague died.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.580
I feel bad too.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:45.780
It really was a coincidence.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:46.540
Enough.

00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:47.830
Director Dai.

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:48.980
What is it?

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:51.110
A suspect died during the arrest.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.060
How?

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:52.540
I don't know.

00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.900
Probably a drug overdose.

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:55.830
We have to wait for the autopsy.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:56.640
Any drugs on him?

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.190
No.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:27:59.540
Just a dagger and 70,000 in cash.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.790
No drugs?

00:28:00.790 --> 00:28:01.440
No.

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.550
Tell Zhang Yan

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:05.480
to check the deceased's identity.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:40.230
Honey.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.340
Where are you?

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:43.040
At the shop.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:44.150
Go to the Youth Center

00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:45.810
to pick up Hu Wenjing's two kids.

00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:46.440
Bye.

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:51.510
Director Dai.

00:28:51.530 --> 00:28:52.790
Did you find anything?

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:54.200
Yes.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.960
The suspect is Lv Deli.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.350
He entered the country yesterday.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.950
Currently staying at Yuelai Hotel.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:01.150
The long-haired guy.

00:29:03.270 --> 00:29:04.480
Lv Deli is dead.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:06.090
You're in trouble now.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:08.370
What trouble are we in?

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.400
A dealer died during the arrest

00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.270
from sudden illness.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.030
What trouble are we in?

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:13.090
It's not our fault.

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:14.570
Why are you glaring?

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:16.520
Do you have proof he's a dealer?

00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:18.240
Didn't he just say?

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:18.960
Besides 70,000 in cash

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:19.650
and a dagger,

00:29:19.650 --> 00:29:21.510
did we find a single gram of drugs?

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.680
It makes no sense.

00:29:25.550 --> 00:29:28.030
Logically,
he should be Ding Lai's supplier.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.230
Why would he bring cash to meet Ding Lai?

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.150
Qin,

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.970
did we get it wrong?

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.000
One hour.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.060
I guarantee she'll pass it in an hour.

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:41.450
Is it possible

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:43.000
that the dead guy, Lv Deli,

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.240
was the supplier

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.030
using a body mule to transport the drugs?

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:46.960
The mule

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.720
couldn't pass it in time,

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.340
but he was in a rush to make the deal.

00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.250
Time was up.

00:29:51.270 --> 00:29:52.640
As the supplier,

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.030
he had to explain to the buyer.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:54.920
That tracks, right?

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.240
Could that be it?

00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:59.010
How many people registered at the hotel?

00:29:59.710 --> 00:30:00.600
Just one.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:02.190
But small hotels like that

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:04.590
usually aren't strict with registration.

00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:32.510
Dad,

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.160
is she the new mom?

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:37.160
No.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:39.350
She's a sister.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:42.050
What's her name?

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:44.860
Xiaoyu.

00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:49.230
Why does she look weird?

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.040
She's sick.

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:57.800
Then she's just like me?

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:00.640
No.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:01.640
It's different.

00:31:03.790 --> 00:31:05.620
You have different illnesses.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.850
Jiajia, you'll get better soon.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.810
Acid reflux again?

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.090
I'm fine.

00:31:16.090 --> 00:31:17.280
Get me a cup.

00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:02.010
Ken, what's up?

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:03.870
Xiaodong.

00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.940
There's one thing.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:08.200
I've thought about it,

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.050
and you're the only one I can talk to.

00:32:10.050 --> 00:32:12.250
Jiajia needs more money for treatment?

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.980
I can spare over 20,000.

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.940
If you need it,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
I'll transfer it to you.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:18.090
No.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:19.420
It's not about Jiajia.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.350
But...

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:23.400
what I'm about to tell you,

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.290
you must keep it secret.

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:26.900
Okay, go ahead.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.390
Tell me.

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:37.670
Go ahead.

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:39.270
I have things to do.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.460
Xiaoya asked me
to pick up her friend's kids.

00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.710
You go ahead.

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.660
We'll talk later.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:47.790
It's not urgent.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:49.610
Okay.

00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.580
Hanging up.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:06.310
Are you full?

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:50.270
My turn.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:51.660
Let me have another round.

00:33:51.660 --> 00:33:52.420
We're here.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.890
We said one round each.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:57.530
Get off.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:00.710
Careful.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.480
Wait for me. Let me see.

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:05.240
Play when we get home.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:05.760
Hurry.

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.270
Take off your shoes.

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:09.130
See?

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:11.150
It's not fit.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.800
Sweethearts,

00:34:13.159 --> 00:34:15.290
it's been so long since you visited me.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.150
I'll go make you something good to eat.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:19.120
Don't bother, Mom.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.230
We just ate on the way here.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:21.300
That won't do.

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.949
The kids rarely get to visit.

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.690
Hu Wenjing might pick them up a bit later.

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.880
Just wait.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.650
let me give you some
taro and lotus seed soup.

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.469
Okay.

00:34:33.489 --> 00:34:35.889
-Thank you, Grandma.
-Thank you, Grandma.

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:38.370
Look at the time.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.719
Is Li Xiaoya coming back to stay or not?

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:41.730
Probably busy.

00:34:43.199 --> 00:34:45.989
When are you two
signing the divorce papers?

00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:48.370
We'll see.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:52.590
This can't be delayed.

00:34:54.889 --> 00:34:55.889
Let me tell you,

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.340
the debt collectors came again today.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.390
I was so scared I hid in my room
and didn't dare make a sound.

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:03.180
They were shouting outside,

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.640
said they'd paint the walls

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:06.500
and write slogans if we don't pay.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:08.260
All the neighbors heard it.

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.870
How am I supposed
to show my face in public?

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:12.280
Mom, the kids are here.

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.900
I don't want a divorce.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.080
I'll pay her debts.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:20.320
Why should you?

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:25.020
You've always been giving her money.

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:26.760
She got herself into these debts.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.920
What does it have to do with you?

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.590
Besides...

00:35:28.590 --> 00:35:29.710
Enough.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.590
I've had a long day.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:31.190
Let me take a nap.

00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:32.650
She shouldn't burden you.

00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.320
Can't you see?

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.010
You're so useless.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.370
Don't litter.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:13.430
Even the basic blood type didn't match.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.480
He sent me the matching report.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.980
I got scammed.

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.820
How much?

00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:26.190
100,000.

00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:31.200
I told you long ago.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.510
The online black market isn't reliable.

00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:33.670
But you wouldn't listen.

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:35.280
If you just wait in line,
you could get a kidney.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.990
You say that every time!

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.110
Wait until when?

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:38.850
This year?

00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:47.940
Don't rush.

00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:49.200
Be patient.

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.090
I just hate seeing Jiajia

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.690
suffer through dialysis every time.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:01.790
Me too.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.460
But does acting recklessly help?

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:05.630
Growing up,

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.250
when has taking a shortcut
ever worked for you?

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.660
You should just wait for the relief fund.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:16.250
Stop eating. Let's go.

00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:21.770
Let's go.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:26.960
I'll figure out the money myself.

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:34.240
Xiaoyu, look at this mosquito.

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.940
-Tao?
-It's kissing someone.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.800
How are things?

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.060
Pretty good recently.

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.520
I'm doing okay.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.270
Actually, I have...

00:37:46.010 --> 00:37:47.900
a favor to ask.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:50.120
I have a niece.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.840
She has some intellectual disabilities.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:54.510
And there's been

00:37:54.510 --> 00:37:56.840
some trouble at home lately.

00:37:57.590 --> 00:37:58.590
I was wondering

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:01.070
if I could send her to your place

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:02.360
to stay for a while.

00:38:03.070 --> 00:38:04.000
If that's okay,

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.480
I'll bring her over tomorrow morning.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.480
What do you think?

00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:10.230
Okay.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:11.400
Thanks.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.400
Thanks.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.510
Thanks, brother.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.090
Okay.

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.440
See you tomorrow.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:49.080
