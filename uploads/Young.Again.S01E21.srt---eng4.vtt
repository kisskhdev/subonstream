00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:58.120
Excuse me, coming through.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.439
Make way, please.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.040
Watch your back.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.560
Watch out for the oil.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.159
Watch out for the oil.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.319
You're just parroting.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.400
You're a salad, what oil is there?

00:02:08.439 --> 00:02:09.400
Salad oil.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.159
Tsk.

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.560
Just like that.

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.400
What are you chatting about?

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.840
Chatting about Auntie Cai's son and daughter-in-law.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.759
And the grandson too.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.639
Uncle Liang, why are you leaving?

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.879
He hates hearing about my son's mess.

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:23.919
If it's as bad as you say,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.960
why doesn't your son ask for a divorce?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.879
Divorce?

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.919
What kind of person gets a divorce?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.919
A coward.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:31.159
As you young people say...

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:31.800
What?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.759
A loser.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.479
I...

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.520
I wasn't talking about you.

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:36.599
Then you must be talking about me.

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.479
Anyway,

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:38.879
a real man

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.280
shouldn't just give up.

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.240
Shouldn't run away.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.379
Should stand tall.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:42.860
Yes.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.159
You mean...

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.479
I don't stand tall?

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.039
No.

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.180
She means

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.560
you're not a real man.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.060
Did I ask you to translate?

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:53.379
When did I say that?

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:54.800
When did I say that?

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.520
I'm talking about my son here.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.439
Why are you interrupting blindly?

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.120
Please continue.

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:01.460
If I interrupt again,

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:02.699
then he's your son.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.860
Divorcing at the drop of a hat.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.060
Isn't that just like the old days,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.960
when men cast off wives at a whim?

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.620
That's called being irresponsible.

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:13.520
Once you marry a wife,

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:15.219
training her is up to you.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.819
If she disobeys, you can...

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:19.060
discipline her.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.139
You...

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:21.400
That counts as domestic violence.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.520
What do you think?

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:25.280
That dead husband of mine back then,

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.319
sure didn't spare the violence.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.379
Oh boy.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.719
One wrong word,

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.180
and he'd come right at my face.

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.240
Where there is oppression,

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.599
there is resistance.

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.180
He came at my face,

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:36.599
and I kicked and punched.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.780
I'd get desperate and scratch.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.199
I'd scratch his face to shreds.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.000
Luckily,

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.639
he croaked.

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:46.759
Croaked.

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:48.039
Passed away.

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:49.560
You mean,

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.780
you...

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.039
scratched him to death?

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.139
Oh my.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.020
With his big build and violent temper,

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.620
every time,

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:01.819
he beat me black and blue.

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:02.659
Black eyes.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:06.080
You tell me,

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:07.879
that unlucky son of mine,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.319
if he had half his dad's temper,

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.740
wouldn't be such a wimp.

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.460
Domestic violence.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.180
Look at that, why bother?

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:22.259
Hit a thousand times, hurt your hand eight hundred.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:23.480
It's not worth it.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:24.139
I...

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.839
I'll slap my own mouth.

00:04:28.079 --> 00:04:28.980
Yes, master.

00:04:32.019 --> 00:04:33.180
Slap your mouth

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.720
Who told you to speak?

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.839
It hurts

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:39.279
I can't take it

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.199
Enough

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.360
I'll ask you one more time

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:45.819
These properties in your mother's hands

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.040
where did they come from?

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.740
My grandma passed them to her

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.180
Why pass them to her?

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.459
She is our family's daughter-in-law

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.920
Am I not?

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:56.959
My mom also gave the Chen family

00:04:56.959 --> 00:04:57.959
me, this

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.980
the only male heir in three generations

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.139
Me

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.879
I also gave your Chen family

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.660
the only son for four generations

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.220
Right, your contribution is greater

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.779
Anyway

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.819
Since your grandpa's wife

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:15.879
could pass this house to your dad's wife

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.399
then your dad's wife

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:18.920
should also pass this house

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.420
to your wife

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.860
Makes sense, right?

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.819
No

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.000
No problem

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.459
It does make sense

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:26.920
But

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.959
But what?

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.579
The light changed, let's go

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.100
Is that your daughter?

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:40.759
Don't talk nonsense

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:42.699
Look who this is

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:46.480
Can't tell, can you?

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:49.220
This is our Ms. Liu

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:51.180
when she was young

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:52.639
Let me see

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.199
Let me have a look

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:55.100
Please

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.060
Just let me see

00:05:58.339 --> 00:05:59.199
You don't say

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.000
The eyes and brows really do look alike

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:02.579
Where did you get this?

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.800
Cut out from an old magazine

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:07.740
What magazine nowadays

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.259
would publish such old stills?

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:10.379
Magazines these days

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:11.759
What's strange about that?

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.399
Is it rare?

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.459
This is a magazine from 1965

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.480
Young Pioneer

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.560
Which issue?

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.360
The September issue

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:22.620
How old were you then?

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.980
I was already nine

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:26.199
Excuse me

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:28.779
When you were only nine

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.220
I was already ten years old

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:46.500
Tell me,

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.000
if your mom doesn't want the apartment,

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.980
and just wants the demolition compensation,

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.600
then takes that huge sum of money

00:06:54.779 --> 00:06:56.120
and marries some little old man,

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.040
wouldn't I end up like...

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.699
a dog biting a pig's bladder,

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.480
happy for nothing?

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.620
Why would you bite that thing?

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.899
That's so gross.

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:06.839
If I bite it...

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:09.220
that makes me the dog!

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:10.860
Seriously.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.720
It's a metaphor, get it?

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.000
Use a better metaphor then.

00:07:15.379 --> 00:07:16.879
Like "drawing water with a bamboo basket,"

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:18.399
or "a monkey fishing for the moon."

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.699
Then I'll be the monkey fishing.

00:07:21.439 --> 00:07:23.040
A monkey isn't much better than a dog.

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.399
Can't you wish me well?

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:26.959
How could I? How would I dare?

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.040
Alright.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:30.100
When we go in later,

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.240
let's play the emotional card first.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.160
Whatever the old lady likes to hear,

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.259
that's what we'll say.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.339
To soften her stubborn heart.

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.939
So what does my mom like to hear?

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.819
She likes to hear...

00:07:43.139 --> 00:07:44.000
How should I know?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.180
She's your mom, not mine.

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:45.839
Why ask me?

00:07:46.019 --> 00:07:47.399
You two don't get along anyway.

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:49.480
My mom probably won't like anything you say.

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:51.839
Fine.

00:07:53.199 --> 00:07:53.779
How about this?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.379
When we go in,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.680
I won't say a word.

00:07:56.779 --> 00:07:58.120
You do all the talking, okay?

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.800
That works. My mom...

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.800
seeing how you usually

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.560
boss me around, she can't stand it.

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:04.740
If I could...

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.019
you know, lecture you,

00:08:06.019 --> 00:08:07.060
scold you,

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:08.079
tell you off...

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:09.500
my mom would definitely be happy to see that.

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.660
Don't get me wrong.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.560
Fine.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.620
However you tell me off in there,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.779
I'll take it.

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:20.420
I'll be totally submissive.

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.519
I won't make a peep.

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:22.319
Will that work?

00:08:22.379 --> 00:08:24.779
Really? Then it'd be best if I...

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.040
start cursing immediately,

00:08:26.079 --> 00:08:27.139
and raise my hand to hit you.

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:28.800
My mom would be even happier to see that.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.199
Okay.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.820
What do you mean "okay"?

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:33.360
Wait a minute.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.940
You actually want to hit me?

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:35.759
You damn Dabao!

00:08:35.879 --> 00:08:37.039
I wouldn't dare! Just kidding.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.340
How could I bear to hit you?

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:41.080
That son of mine is so spineless.

00:08:41.179 --> 00:08:43.179
Every time he goes shopping with his wife,

00:08:44.779 --> 00:08:45.460
he trots along eagerly,

00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:46.600
trotting right behind her,

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.840
carrying bags in both hands.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.759
He probably has one in his mouth too.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:54.000
But that daughter-in-law, that little fox,

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.299
is completely empty-handed.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.200
She's out in front,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:56.700
just...

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:57.860
sashaying,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:58.440
sashaying along.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:08:59.200
Mom.

00:09:03.259 --> 00:09:04.600
Am I seeing things?

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:05.899
Mom.

00:09:07.039 --> 00:09:08.659
Am I hearing things?

00:09:08.919 --> 00:09:09.639
What's wrong, Mom?

00:09:10.179 --> 00:09:12.340
She just called me "Mom."

00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:13.600
Was she calling me?

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.820
Obviously.

00:09:14.879 --> 00:09:16.120
If she doesn't call you Mom,

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.820
what else would she call you?

00:09:19.419 --> 00:09:20.759
Usually she calls me...

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:23.019
Or just "Old Lady."

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.419
She wouldn't dare.

00:09:25.179 --> 00:09:25.960
Hu Xiaoli!

00:09:26.379 --> 00:09:27.559
Why are you just standing there?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.820
Hurry up and take the stuff...

00:09:28.919 --> 00:09:30.440
...into my mom's room.

00:09:33.039 --> 00:09:34.200
Okay!

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.700
Show some awareness.

00:09:36.980 --> 00:09:39.039
See if there are any seasonal clothes in the room...

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.559
...and wash them all for me.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:41.620
Okay!

00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:44.399
Is there something wrong with my brain?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.759
Why are you pinching me?

00:09:47.779 --> 00:09:49.519
I'm checking if I'm dreaming.

00:09:49.759 --> 00:09:51.320
No, then you should pinch yourself.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:51.899
Or you can pinch...

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:52.480
...pinch him.

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:55.460
Dabao.

00:09:55.659 --> 00:09:56.139
Mom.

00:09:56.139 --> 00:09:57.580
Did something happen to our family?

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.139
No.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:58.919
Nothing happened.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.139
Impossible.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.820
Otherwise, why are you acting like this?

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.879
And why is she acting like that?

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:05.539
You mean...

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:07.580
...how she usually gives you attitude?

00:10:07.659 --> 00:10:09.440
And is fierce towards me, right?

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:10.299
Mom.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.100
That's all just on the surface.

00:10:12.159 --> 00:10:13.700
It's an illusion.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:15.639
It's because she...

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:17.440
...is afraid of me.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:18.539
Because she...

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.919
...respects you.

00:10:22.139 --> 00:10:24.440
Usually she pulls a long face,

00:10:24.539 --> 00:10:25.940
speaks nastily,

00:10:26.139 --> 00:10:27.620
and makes indirect accusations.

00:10:27.899 --> 00:10:29.960
So that turns out to be respect for me?

00:10:30.059 --> 00:10:30.940
Exactly.

00:10:31.039 --> 00:10:33.379
She's learning from you.

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.419
Back in the day, you...

00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.759
...didn't you treat my dad exactly like that?

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:37.000
You're talking nonsense!

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:38.259
Back then...

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.480
...if I dared to push my luck like she does,

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:42.399
your dad wouldn't even need to lift a finger.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.960
His grandma would have slapped me long ago.

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.299
Mom.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:47.659
We have to give her...

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:49.700
...a chance to repent.

00:10:49.919 --> 00:10:51.120
After all, this Hu Xiaoli...

00:10:51.259 --> 00:10:52.340
...for our Chen family...

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.000
...gave birth to a big grandson.

00:10:54.059 --> 00:10:56.100
She's done a great service.

00:10:56.639 --> 00:10:57.580
Speaking of the grandson...

00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.080
Where is my grandson?

00:10:59.220 --> 00:10:59.500
No, Mom...

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:00.080
Where is my big grandson?

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:01.919
Don't look, he went to his grandma's house.

00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:03.960
Next time.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:04.600
Mom.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.820
Should I hang these clothes in the backyard?

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.159
Obviously.

00:11:08.379 --> 00:11:10.159
If not in the backyard, where would you hang them?

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:11.700
Don't you have eyes?

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:12.740
Isn't it right there?

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:13.279
I'm just saying...

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.679
Thanks.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:16.980
So...

00:11:17.279 --> 00:11:18.019
How was that?

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.120
Had a nice chat with Mom?

00:11:20.299 --> 00:11:21.200
Nonsense.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.059
If we, mother and daughter, don't chat well,

00:11:23.059 --> 00:11:24.320
who would?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:25.139
Go.

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:26.580
Go do whatever you need to do.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:27.139
No...

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.200
I'm going to tidy up Mom's room some more.

00:11:31.879 --> 00:11:32.559
Hurry up and go.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.039
Something's wrong.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.539
I can't put my finger on what's wrong.

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:38.899
Anyway...

00:11:39.259 --> 00:11:40.019
something is wrong.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.440
Ms. Liu

00:11:50.019 --> 00:11:50.720
Working out?

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.740
President Li

00:11:52.419 --> 00:11:53.299
You should practice too

00:11:57.899 --> 00:11:58.480
This

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.139
Is for you

00:12:02.419 --> 00:12:03.299
Thank you

00:12:05.539 --> 00:12:06.840
What is this?

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:08.559
Open it and see

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:14.799
Do you like it?

00:12:15.759 --> 00:12:17.419
Like me?

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:19.259
I wouldn't go that far

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:20.980
No

00:12:21.299 --> 00:12:22.960
What do you mean by giving me this?

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.419
Believe it or not

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.659
But you have to believe it

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:29.100
This is from when I was ten

00:12:29.139 --> 00:12:31.460
Cut out from *Young Pioneer* magazine

00:12:32.759 --> 00:12:34.179
Since that time

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.159
You have been my idol

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.299
Right up until now

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:38.419
Wait

00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.080
You're saying

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.340
This was when you were ten

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.919
Cut out from a magazine

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:44.700
Yes

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:46.639
Of course

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.840
Later, I touched it up a bit

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.039
Framed it

00:12:50.779 --> 00:12:52.139
Added a backing

00:12:52.139 --> 00:12:53.059
Impossible

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.240
How is it impossible?

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:58.279
Impossible

00:12:58.279 --> 00:13:00.940
When you were ten, he was already this old

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:01.820
How is he old?

00:13:01.820 --> 00:13:02.740
That was you...

00:13:06.019 --> 00:13:06.620
Who is this?

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:08.360
No, who is this?

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.139
You damn old Fan

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:25.299
This female student

00:13:25.379 --> 00:13:27.639
Please do not play around while driving

00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:31.539
That's for being smug

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.120
Bossing me around like that

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.440
You're getting a kick out of it

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:38.759
Isn't this all to make Mom happy?

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:40.679
Your mom, that's *your* mom

00:13:40.759 --> 00:13:41.879
My mom

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.820
If she's happy, then I should be unhappy

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.440
Tell me

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:48.879
How did it go?

00:13:48.899 --> 00:13:50.600
How else? It hurts

00:13:51.879 --> 00:13:52.820
I'm asking

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.179
You and your mom

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:55.620
How was the chat?

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:57.019
The chat was great

00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:58.440
My mom today

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.799
Really had a good talk

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.019
The old lady was so happy

00:14:02.299 --> 00:14:03.240
I'm asking

00:14:03.559 --> 00:14:05.919
About the house matter with your mom

00:14:05.919 --> 00:14:07.000
How did that go?

00:14:07.539 --> 00:14:09.000
We didn't talk about the house

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.500
What did we come here for?

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.679
To give the old lady gifts

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:17.179
To do laundry and clean up

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.399
I brought it up several times

00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:22.259
My mom wouldn't take the bait

00:14:23.399 --> 00:14:24.259
The way I see it

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.379
Let's use Doudou

00:14:25.779 --> 00:14:27.580
My mom's soft spot is Doudou

00:14:28.539 --> 00:14:29.460
Doudou

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.820
He's just a little kid

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:32.980
What does he know?

00:14:33.299 --> 00:14:34.940
It doesn't matter if he doesn't understand

00:14:35.059 --> 00:14:36.980
You can teach him

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:38.360
Teach

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:40.419
What am I supposed to teach him?

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:45.700
That's immoral, you know?

00:14:46.919 --> 00:14:47.559
You're mad

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:48.460
You're mad

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.460
It was just a joke

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.120
No need to make it a moral issue

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.379
Is that how you joke?

00:14:53.799 --> 00:14:55.379
You're harming others with no benefit to yourself

00:14:55.419 --> 00:14:56.659
Harming me doesn't benefit you?

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.980
How do you know

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:00.000
It doesn't benefit me?

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:01.460
Benefit you? Benefit you how?

00:15:02.539 --> 00:15:03.679
I can't tell you now

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.059
Just wait and see

00:15:13.139 --> 00:15:14.000
Hello

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.120
Grandma

00:15:18.759 --> 00:15:19.500
Doudou

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.620
It really is Doudou

00:15:25.299 --> 00:15:26.500
Let Grandma give you a hug

00:15:26.679 --> 00:15:27.340
My baby

00:15:28.139 --> 00:15:29.740
Grandma can barely lift you anymore

00:15:32.019 --> 00:15:33.240
Let Grandma get a good look at you, baby

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:33.600
Come here

00:15:34.139 --> 00:15:34.500
Come

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.539
Let Grandma take a good look at you

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:38.799
You've grown taller

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:41.620
Why are you still so thin, child?

00:15:43.139 --> 00:15:44.940
Grandma missed you so much

00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:46.799
Why haven't you come to see Grandma for so long?

00:15:46.899 --> 00:15:47.919
Did you miss Grandma?

00:15:47.919 --> 00:15:48.600
I did

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:49.659
Where did you miss me?

00:15:50.179 --> 00:15:51.139
My head missed you

00:15:51.419 --> 00:15:52.220
My heart missed you

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.440
My tummy missed you

00:15:53.659 --> 00:15:54.539
My legs missed you

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.379
My whole body missed Grandma

00:15:58.379 --> 00:16:00.360
Baby, my good baby

00:16:01.139 --> 00:16:02.580
What delicious food do you want to eat?

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:03.679
Grandma will go buy it for you

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:04.659
I don't want treats

00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:06.100
I don't want treats

00:16:06.779 --> 00:16:08.179
You've really grown up and become sensible

00:16:08.179 --> 00:16:10.179
You know you can't just ask for food, right?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.299
Then what fun things do you want?

00:16:12.559 --> 00:16:13.460
I don't want toys

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:14.779
I don't want toys either

00:16:15.159 --> 00:16:17.059
Then what do you want?

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:17.759
I want...

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:18.580
You see?

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:20.700
You do want something after all

00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.759
No matter what you want,

00:16:22.759 --> 00:16:24.059
Grandma will buy it for you

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.419
I want Grandma...

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.200
Grandma is right here

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.820
I just want Grandma...

00:16:34.399 --> 00:16:36.559
My grandson is so sweet

00:16:36.639 --> 00:16:40.000
I want Grandma to give the house to Mom

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.840
Okay, Grandma will just...

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320
What?

00:16:43.519 --> 00:16:44.620
You... what house?

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:47.679
It's because they want to demolish our house

00:16:47.679 --> 00:16:49.759
Grandma, you give the house to Mom

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:51.840
Then Mom can make money

00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:54.159
And save it for me to get a wife

00:16:54.279 --> 00:16:55.820
What is all this nonsense?

00:16:57.399 --> 00:16:58.039
Doudou

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.419
These words...

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.159
Your mom told you to say this to me, didn't she?

00:17:01.179 --> 00:17:01.700
No

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:04.859
This "no"...

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.140
Was also something your mom told you to say, right?

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:07.900
Yes

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.960
I knew it

00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:13.500
But why does your mom need so much money?

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:14.660
What is it for?

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:16.920
To save for me to get a wife

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.400
Stop talking about getting a wife

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.660
You're too young to get married

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.259
Your mom...

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:24.200
Didn't she join some...

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.839
Illegal fundraising scheme?

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:27.920
What is a plane organization?

00:17:28.099 --> 00:17:28.839
No

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:29.960
It's just that...

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:31.619
It's illegal, it's that...

00:17:31.619 --> 00:17:33.019
It's...

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:34.119
The kind that breaks the law

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.579
The kind of organization that scams people

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.059
It has nothing to do with planes

00:17:38.579 --> 00:17:39.960
I can't explain it to a child like you

00:17:40.619 --> 00:17:41.200
Anyway...

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.240
Where did your mom and dad die off to?

00:17:43.339 --> 00:17:45.140
My mom and dad didn't die

00:17:45.279 --> 00:17:46.240
I'm sorry

00:17:46.339 --> 00:17:47.980
Grandma got anxious and misspoke

00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.759
Where did your mom and dad go?

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.059
How can you call this cheating?

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.160
That sounds way too harsh.

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:09.420
Let's put it another way.

00:18:10.819 --> 00:18:11.539
Swindling.

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.279
That's even worse than cheating.

00:18:13.299 --> 00:18:14.299
Fraud.

00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:15.299
Swindling comes first.

00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:16.259
Hoaxing.

00:18:17.339 --> 00:18:18.059
Hoodwinking.

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:20.019
Luring.

00:18:21.299 --> 00:18:23.200
Isn't there a nicer word for it?

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:24.640
Something nicer.

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:26.900
"Coaxing" sounds a bit better.

00:18:28.039 --> 00:18:28.480
Right.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:29.599
Coaxing.

00:18:30.539 --> 00:18:32.420
We'll just coax your mom...

00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:35.240
into transferring the house to my name.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:37.619
I feel like...

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.319
there's no need to rush.

00:18:43.259 --> 00:18:44.619
My dear sir, look at the situation.

00:18:44.619 --> 00:18:46.279
And you're still not in a rush?

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.900
Didn't you see the huge "Demolish" sign on the wall?

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:51.920
You're talking about across the street.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:53.740
There's no talk of Relocation on our side.

00:18:54.819 --> 00:18:56.079
Call you stupid,

00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:57.460
and you act the fool instantly.

00:18:57.619 --> 00:18:58.240
Call you dumb,

00:18:58.240 --> 00:18:59.339
and you start drooling on the spot.

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.319
For something like this,

00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.839
don't you have to act early?

00:19:02.839 --> 00:19:04.319
And plan ahead?

00:19:04.579 --> 00:19:06.059
Actually,

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:08.279
whether we transfer the title or not,

00:19:08.619 --> 00:19:11.019
no matter whose name is on the old lady's house,

00:19:11.539 --> 00:19:12.680
in the very end,

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.640
won't it go to our Doudou anyway?

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.519
Don't talk nonsense.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:17.660
Her giving it,

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.640
and me giving it,

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.819
is that the same?

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:25.400
That's awesome

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:27.599
Your Grandpa Liang here

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:28.980
Is as good as ever

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.079
Still has the style

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:31.500
Is still going strong

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:33.920
Your turn

00:19:36.119 --> 00:19:36.539
Go

00:19:39.079 --> 00:19:40.059
That's no good

00:19:40.059 --> 00:19:41.700
That's called a 'shove'

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:44.539
You're using your arm strength

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.079
Back in our day

00:19:46.079 --> 00:19:47.599
In the street battles

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.500
People would laugh at you for that

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.819
My turn

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:56.160
That's even worse

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:57.500
That's called a 'squeeze'

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.799
I didn't use my arm strength

00:19:59.859 --> 00:20:01.140
That's still no good

00:20:01.359 --> 00:20:02.740
You squeezed it out

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.140
You didn't flick it

00:20:04.799 --> 00:20:06.940
Our profound national sport

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:07.940
What do you know about it

00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:10.519
Tell me, when people get old

00:20:10.579 --> 00:20:11.720
What do they fear most

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.740
I know this

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:13.880
Daughters-in-law

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:15.140
Get out of here

00:20:16.519 --> 00:20:18.900
Old people fear loneliness the most

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.579
Don't worry about that

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:22.279
When you get old

00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:24.799
Even if I become a ghost

00:20:24.859 --> 00:20:26.640
I'll stay right by your side

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.299
Get lost

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:28.819
You're haunting me already

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.819
I am...

00:20:32.059 --> 00:20:32.880
Hello there. You're here

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.940
Hello

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:38.480
I'm talking about your mom

00:20:39.059 --> 00:20:40.819
Why do you think she moved into the nursing home

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.079
She said there are many peers to hang out with

00:20:43.319 --> 00:20:44.240
Exactly

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:46.720
But what if, while hanging out

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:47.940
She finds true love

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:48.720
What then

00:20:48.799 --> 00:20:49.339
She wouldn't dare

00:20:49.339 --> 00:20:50.880
I'd like to see who dares to seduce my mom

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.779
Tch, listen to you

00:20:52.839 --> 00:20:54.220
Maybe your mom is the one seducing them

00:20:58.180 --> 00:20:59.559
Hello? Honey

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:04.299
For real

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:05.660
No

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:07.740
Then I did all this for nothing

00:21:11.359 --> 00:21:11.900
Alright

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:12.779
I know, I know

00:21:12.819 --> 00:21:13.319
Hanging up

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:17.900
You really jinxed it

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:19.579
Look at my big mouth

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.400
Who's a jinx

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:22.740
What did I say

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:24.640
Our block

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.779
Isn't relocating

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.660
Where does it not hurt? Where

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:28.859
Relocation

00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:30.839
Speak clearly

00:21:31.259 --> 00:21:31.880
Hu

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:32.740
Hu

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:34.640
Here to see your mom

00:21:56.619 --> 00:21:57.720
President Li, you're here.

00:21:58.299 --> 00:21:59.420
How is it? Take a look.

00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:00.259
This...

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.079
This is nice.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:03.819
Isn't it?

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:04.579
Where did it come from?

00:22:05.119 --> 00:22:06.240
Professor Fan gave it to me.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.660
When he was nine years old,

00:22:08.859 --> 00:22:10.700
he cut it out of a magazine.

00:22:11.079 --> 00:22:12.640
He's kept it all this time.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.519
How wonderful. How rare.

00:22:15.319 --> 00:22:16.880
The year he was nine?

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.440
Right.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:18.880
This... is my...

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:20.940
Ms. Liu,

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:22.559
you don't know that nowadays there are

00:22:22.559 --> 00:22:24.740
shops that specialize in old newspapers and magazines.

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.599
They have ones from every year, month, and day.

00:22:28.059 --> 00:22:29.339
Haven't you heard of this?

00:22:30.299 --> 00:22:31.000
President Li,

00:22:31.759 --> 00:22:33.460
speculating about others like this...

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.640
I don't think it's very nice.

00:22:36.099 --> 00:22:37.200
What speculation?

00:22:37.299 --> 00:22:38.500
What others?

00:22:38.539 --> 00:22:39.759
That's just who I am.

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:41.559
It's not me, it's him...

00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:42.500
No...

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.819
What are you trying to say?

00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:45.859
I'm so angry!

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.019
You're angry?

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.420
Why are you angry?

00:22:53.019 --> 00:22:53.579
Dabao!

00:22:53.579 --> 00:22:54.039
Doudou!

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.660
Let's go.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:58.920
Mom.

00:23:00.319 --> 00:23:01.079
Bye, Mom.

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:02.319
No...

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.539
Why are you leaving?

00:23:03.839 --> 00:23:04.680
No...

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.480
What on earth is going on?

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.259
No, you...

00:23:07.259 --> 00:23:09.240
At least leave the stuff here!

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:13.900
Uncle Li...

00:23:14.059 --> 00:23:14.599
You...

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:17.119
What's happening?

00:23:17.579 --> 00:23:18.819
That son of mine, let me tell you...

00:23:18.819 --> 00:23:19.319
Old Li,

00:23:22.839 --> 00:23:23.859
I didn't provoke him!

00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:30.960
This...

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.180
Who is this directed at?

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:33.559
I've just about had it with you.

00:23:33.779 --> 00:23:34.859
Look what you've done.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.480
I won't go!

00:23:49.559 --> 00:23:50.039
I...

00:23:50.579 --> 00:23:51.779
I want to find Grandma!

00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:53.920
I want to find Grandpa Liang to play marbles!

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.680
Shut your mouth.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.099
Forget about Grandma.

00:23:57.339 --> 00:23:58.700
You're never allowed to see her again.

00:23:58.799 --> 00:23:59.480
Why?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:02.440
I told Grandma everything you taught me to say.

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:04.420
It's useless to say anything now.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:06.680
Our area isn't being relocated anymore.

00:24:10.099 --> 00:24:10.619
Hello?

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:11.700
It's me.

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:15.660
I want to go back!

00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:16.299
Shh!

00:24:16.579 --> 00:24:17.660
Don't make a sound.

00:24:17.779 --> 00:24:18.859
If you upset your mom,

00:24:18.859 --> 00:24:20.099
I'll get in trouble too.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.119
For real?

00:24:25.279 --> 00:24:27.099
Is there a confirmation?

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.140
You can't jerk people around like this.

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:31.619
Okay.

00:24:31.619 --> 00:24:32.519
Got it.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:37.579
Stop the car.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.519
Turn around. Back to the nursing home.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:40.980
What are you doing?

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.440
Hurry, take this stuff...

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.539
and Doudou...

00:24:44.579 --> 00:24:45.819
and send them back to your mom.

00:24:47.259 --> 00:24:49.420
Why do you change your mind every second?

00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.880
What is this nonsense?

00:24:51.619 --> 00:24:53.019
Can you blame me?

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:55.339
My best friend just called again.

00:24:56.059 --> 00:24:57.400
Confirmed news.

00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:58.680
Our neighborhood...

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.619
is being relocated again.

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:01.920
Really?
