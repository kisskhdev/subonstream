00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:19.575
My daughter...

00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:23.345
Please save my daughter, Min Seo.

00:01:30.415 --> 00:01:31.455
I...

00:01:35.325 --> 00:01:36.425
I'm begging you.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.465
Hey, what are you doing, Counselor?

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.775
I'll save her, Counselor.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:56.945
But I need a favor in return.

00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:00.645
What? Professor Han?

00:02:01.245 --> 00:02:02.255
Yes.

00:02:03.685 --> 00:02:06.625
He's either dead or being held captive.
It has to be one or the other.

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:09.455
I was supposed to meet him
at two o'clock today,

00:02:10.525 --> 00:02:11.525
but he never showed up.

00:02:12.395 --> 00:02:13.395
Why?

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:15.795
Professor Han said he would help me.

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:18.195
To get me out of here.

00:02:20.865 --> 00:02:21.935
Get out of here?

00:02:25.135 --> 00:02:26.845
We have three minutes left.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.075
From now on, you do exactly as I say.

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:34.585
I promise you,
I will make sure Min Seo gets treated.

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:38.415
In Professor Han's place,

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:41.055
you're going to help me get out of here.

00:02:42.325 --> 00:02:46.225
I need you to trust me again,
just like you did at the trial.

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:58.235
Min Gyeong, let's get some chicken.

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:02.005
- Reporter Jo, come look at this.
- If it's not urgent, let's eat first.

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:03.515
I'm telling you. Get over here now!

00:03:03.815 --> 00:03:06.815
I spent all day looking for people
who knew Lee Gyu Hyeong...

00:03:06.885 --> 00:03:09.185
and went straight to the Guam police.
I haven't eaten anything.

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.885
What? What's this? Chaeum?

00:03:14.585 --> 00:03:16.825
- Say something.
- Be quiet for a second.

00:03:17.295 --> 00:03:19.965
- Why?
- I've got it. That feeling.

00:03:21.565 --> 00:03:23.765
I can smell an exclusive.

00:03:25.235 --> 00:03:28.975
Check if any political funds were funneled
from Chaeum to Assemblyman Baek.

00:03:29.905 --> 00:03:34.245
I'm going after Chairman Chae Jeong Su,
son of Professor Chae Jeong Hun.

00:03:35.175 --> 00:03:36.815
It's time to put him under the microscope.

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:43.455
You've got some nerve.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:47.855
What were you doing
meeting with Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:03:48.785 --> 00:03:49.795
Let Woo Gyeom go.

00:03:51.225 --> 00:03:52.765
You must have seen it in the notes.

00:03:53.495 --> 00:03:55.265
If we want to develop the cure,

00:03:55.665 --> 00:03:57.765
we have to stop his treatments
immediately.

00:03:58.935 --> 00:04:01.265
If you keep recklessly
using him like this,

00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:05.235
all the research your father and I did
could go down the drain.

00:04:06.075 --> 00:04:07.445
How much more can he take?

00:04:08.275 --> 00:04:09.545
His body, I mean.

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.045
According to his own calculations,

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.785
ten people.

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:15.815
No. Even ten would be pushing it.

00:04:16.615 --> 00:04:18.315
I don't know the exact details,

00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:22.795
but the more blood they draw,
the more his body changes, Chairman Chae!

00:04:23.925 --> 00:04:25.795
We have to pull him out of circulation
immediately.

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:29.695
We may never find another test subject
like him in our lifetime,

00:04:29.795 --> 00:04:31.195
and it's unlikely another one
will ever appear.

00:04:31.795 --> 00:04:34.735
I'll help you.
To mass produce the cure you want so much.

00:04:37.935 --> 00:04:42.205
Why don't we just drain all of his blood
before his condition changes?

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:45.545
What? If we do that...

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:48.385
Don't tell me you're actually worried
about Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:04:48.885 --> 00:04:49.915
No. That's not it.

00:04:50.515 --> 00:04:54.225
Is it your obsession with
your life's work, then?

00:04:57.325 --> 00:04:58.325
Whatever the case,

00:04:59.195 --> 00:05:02.595
you're quite something, Professor.

00:05:03.935 --> 00:05:08.035
Your years of hard work
and dedication to Chaeum...

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.475
I will never forget them.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:14.075
Give my father my regards.

00:05:28.025 --> 00:05:29.025
Director Ahn.

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.695
Since it's come to this,
stage the scene well.

00:05:33.025 --> 00:05:35.565
It's business as usual for you, isn't it?

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:38.635
Yes, Chairman.
I'll take care of it quietly.

00:05:39.335 --> 00:05:40.335
Good.

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:47.405
Hey, get this out of here. Now.

00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:03.355
Welcome, Your Excellency.

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:05.095
"Your Excellency?" Give me a break.

00:06:05.695 --> 00:06:06.695
Have a seat.

00:06:11.065 --> 00:06:14.735
An aide in the Republic of Korea
must be paid quite well.

00:06:14.935 --> 00:06:16.135
Decent? Hardly.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:19.975
With my son starting middle school,
things are getting tight.

00:06:20.045 --> 00:06:23.145
For someone with tight finances,
this is a lavish spread, don't you think?

00:06:23.845 --> 00:06:25.375
Did Assemblyman Baek arrange this?

00:06:27.015 --> 00:06:28.415
Or is this a case of...

00:06:28.415 --> 00:06:32.315
"When the cat's away, the mice will play?"

00:06:34.285 --> 00:06:36.895
So blunt and righteous.
You really haven't changed a bit.

00:06:37.695 --> 00:06:38.925
This is all wild-caught.

00:06:39.325 --> 00:06:44.165
- Please, enjoy the food and have a drink.
- Let's skip the empty pleasantries.

00:06:44.535 --> 00:06:45.735
Just get to the point.

00:06:49.875 --> 00:06:50.875
Very well.

00:06:53.005 --> 00:06:55.475
Prosecutor, why are you so obsessed
with the Lee Woo Gyeom case?

00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:00.645
I should be asking you the same thing,
Chief Pyo.

00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:04.155
Why are you so obsessed with my case?

00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:10.225
The trial's already over,
so it's not your case anymore, is it?

00:07:11.555 --> 00:07:12.925
Let's stop playing word games.

00:07:14.025 --> 00:07:15.695
And let's be honest with each other.

00:07:17.265 --> 00:07:19.435
The other day,
when you came to my office...

00:07:20.065 --> 00:07:21.635
Why did you leak that information about...

00:07:21.635 --> 00:07:23.635
Professor Han experimenting
on Lee Woo Gyeom?

00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:26.645
While Lee Woo Gyeom was in a coma...

00:07:26.805 --> 00:07:31.545
Did you know Professor Han used him
as a research subject?

00:07:31.815 --> 00:07:33.045
Where did you get that information?

00:07:33.315 --> 00:07:37.255
Where it came from isn't important.
What matters is that before you knew,

00:07:37.585 --> 00:07:42.795
someone had already taken care of things
regarding Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:07:48.825 --> 00:07:49.895
It's no big deal, really.

00:07:51.195 --> 00:07:52.605
A man has got to make a living.

00:07:53.705 --> 00:07:55.435
When the cat's away, the mice should play,
don't you think?

00:08:02.515 --> 00:08:03.775
So, you're saying...

00:08:04.545 --> 00:08:07.615
you want to take down Assemblyman Baek,
and you're going to use me to do it?

00:08:08.485 --> 00:08:09.685
"Use you?"

00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:13.185
I distinctly told you not to dig too deep.

00:08:13.755 --> 00:08:16.495
- You're the one who wouldn't stop.
- Assemblyman Baek...

00:08:17.195 --> 00:08:19.895
How involved is he in Professor Han's
illegal medical practices?

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:21.365
Before we get to that,

00:08:21.795 --> 00:08:24.565
shouldn't your promise to ensure my safety
come first?

00:08:39.945 --> 00:08:40.945
Fine, whatever...

00:08:41.445 --> 00:08:42.855
I might as well hear...

00:08:43.415 --> 00:08:44.485
how you intend to use me.

00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:48.785
It's a very long story.

00:08:49.225 --> 00:08:51.625
You've been looking at this the wrong way
from the very beginning, Prosecutor.

00:08:52.025 --> 00:08:53.025
What do you mean?

00:08:53.725 --> 00:08:56.095
This whole thing didn't start
with Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:08:57.565 --> 00:08:58.565
What?

00:08:59.065 --> 00:09:01.665
Chairman Chae Jeong Su's father,
Professor Chae Jeong Hun.

00:09:02.465 --> 00:09:04.475
You have to trace it all the way back
to Professor Chae Jeong Hun.

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:41.305
It's a pleasure.

00:10:42.405 --> 00:10:43.875
Chairman Chae Jeong Su.

00:10:47.705 --> 00:10:49.615
What did you want to see me about?

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.785
I wanted to thank you.

00:10:53.345 --> 00:10:54.785
Thanks to your support,

00:10:55.385 --> 00:10:56.985
I'm able to treat patients...

00:10:58.385 --> 00:10:59.885
in this wonderful environment.

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:05.295
"Wonderful environment?"

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:08.225
You're a real piece of work,
Mr. Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:14.905
You're back to being monitored
twenty-four seven,

00:11:15.165 --> 00:11:16.675
just another test subject.

00:11:18.075 --> 00:11:19.075
Are you really okay with that?

00:11:22.045 --> 00:11:23.245
That's a bit harsh.

00:11:24.715 --> 00:11:28.585
Calling a living person
a "test subject" to their face.

00:11:31.555 --> 00:11:33.625
A while ago, you took my notes...

00:11:34.625 --> 00:11:35.755
from Professor Han, didn't you?

00:11:39.225 --> 00:11:43.035
Don't tell me you wasted your time
trying to understand them.

00:11:48.135 --> 00:11:52.235
Did you really think you could
achieve something...

00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:55.605
that medical professionals
worldwide couldn't?

00:11:58.215 --> 00:12:00.915
You're awfully generous with yourself.

00:12:06.085 --> 00:12:07.085
Mr. Chairman.

00:12:08.355 --> 00:12:11.625
You can't mass-produce the cure
without me.

00:12:15.795 --> 00:12:18.295
I've already seen the notes, so I'm aware.

00:12:19.435 --> 00:12:23.075
- That's why we brought you to Chaeum...
- I have a question.

00:12:24.705 --> 00:12:25.935
I still have my blood, don't I?

00:12:27.505 --> 00:12:30.015
Can my blood be used to cure
incurable diseases forever?

00:12:31.245 --> 00:12:32.445
What do you mean?

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:37.115
Every time I give blood for patients,
my body generates new blood.

00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:42.185
The new blood my body generates...
Will it contain the cure or not?

00:12:44.495 --> 00:12:45.655
Go ahead, tell me.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:48.025
This is your only chance for an answer.

00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:52.965
It must.

00:12:53.835 --> 00:12:56.235
How else could you have treated
so many patients until now?

00:12:58.235 --> 00:12:59.545
Here's a more interesting question.

00:13:02.005 --> 00:13:04.945
What percentage of the cure
is in my blood right now?

00:13:05.145 --> 00:13:08.385
And I'll be drawing blood
for the rest of my life.

00:13:08.645 --> 00:13:11.155
Will the potency of the cure
diminish each time?

00:13:11.455 --> 00:13:14.555
Will it remain stable? Or...

00:13:16.155 --> 00:13:17.325
will it disappear completely?

00:13:23.565 --> 00:13:24.565
Chairman Chae.

00:13:25.395 --> 00:13:27.165
Do you still see me
as just a test subject?

00:13:29.935 --> 00:13:32.205
I'm the one running the experiment here.

00:13:32.875 --> 00:13:35.705
Everyone who wanted a piece of me,
including you...

00:13:35.875 --> 00:13:39.345
are all just test subjects
in my research. All 17 of them.

00:13:40.115 --> 00:13:42.345
My test subjects who failed
to serve their purpose.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:44.385
You remember how they died, don't you?

00:13:52.055 --> 00:13:53.395
So, Chairman...

00:13:54.725 --> 00:13:57.335
You and I need to play nice.

00:13:58.495 --> 00:14:01.135
If I were to fail this treatment
with the whole world watching,

00:14:04.035 --> 00:14:05.275
what would happen to Chaeum?

00:14:06.245 --> 00:14:07.345
You know full well what would.

00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:19.055
I'm reporting live in front of
Hana Hospital where Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:14:19.155 --> 00:14:22.655
is set to begin his 3rd treatment
for his 1st outpatient session.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:28.025
The patient, Jeon Seung Hun,
has both Crohn's disease and hemophilia,

00:14:28.125 --> 00:14:30.465
making his case extremely rare.

00:14:30.895 --> 00:14:33.335
As a result, a massive crowd of reporters
has gathered here today,

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:35.405
creating a complete media circus.

00:14:38.975 --> 00:14:43.175
- Mom.
- Citizens who trust Lee Woo Gyeom...

00:14:43.345 --> 00:14:47.815
and citizens praying for the patient,
have begun to gather.

00:14:48.315 --> 00:14:51.155
At this moment, a mix of anxiety and hope

00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:08.885
I need the two of you to start
by going over the Chaeum audit reports.

of the Chaeum Research Institute...

Do you remember what kind of treatments
the patients received back then?

00:17:17.295 --> 00:17:20.305
I remember that most patients
were hospitalized long-term.

These treatments weren't approved,
were they?

00:17:24.205 --> 00:17:25.205
- No.
- No.

- You mean Dr. Song Min Su?
- He was a young and very capable doctor.

Do you know what kind of research
the two of them were conducting?

00:17:33.115 --> 00:17:37.355
As I recall, even within Chaeum,
Professor Han's project was kept secret.

Kept secret?

Though their identity was never revealed,

00:17:41.655 --> 00:17:45.555
it began with a tip from a whistleblower
at the Chaeum Research Institute.

00:17:46.095 --> 00:17:49.325
Chaeum forged surgical consent forms
for patients with no next of kin.

00:17:49.395 --> 00:17:51.865
When a patient died during surgery,
the prosecution filed charges,

00:17:51.935 --> 00:17:53.635
and after the trial,
it even led to a national audit.

The prosecutor on the case at the time
was Oh Hyeon Deuk.

The district attorney who approved it
was the current Assemblyman Baek Sang Hwa.

00:18:00.405 --> 00:18:04.045
And the person who performed the surgery
and testified at the National Assembly...

00:18:04.375 --> 00:18:06.415
was the late Dr. Song Min Su.

00:32:30.345 --> 00:32:31.975
I'm going to do some digging
on Chairman Chae.

00:32:33.715 --> 00:32:37.115
Right. Okay, got it.

00:32:49.195 --> 00:32:50.295
What's going on?

00:32:50.365 --> 00:32:51.935
That's the guy I saw
outside Professor Han's house.

00:33:30.565 --> 00:33:32.035
So, where are we heading now?

00:33:33.975 --> 00:33:34.975
For now...

00:33:44.855 --> 00:33:46.755
We will now begin the emergency briefing.

00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:49.225
Today at approximately 12:03 p.m.,

00:33:49.685 --> 00:33:51.455
Lee Woo Gyeom, who was being held
at the correctional center,

00:33:51.755 --> 00:33:55.595
escaped during an off-site medical visit,
breaching security.

00:33:56.395 --> 00:34:00.365
Serial killer Lee Woo Gyeom, once a medic
at the Chaeum Correctional Center,

00:34:00.665 --> 00:34:03.605
has escaped during
an off-site medical appointment.

00:34:03.965 --> 00:34:06.635
The police are currently tracking
Lee Woo Gyeom's whereabouts.

00:34:11.975 --> 00:34:12.975
Are you okay?

00:34:42.945 --> 00:34:43.945
Hey, look at me.

00:34:47.945 --> 00:34:48.945
Are you all right?

00:34:51.155 --> 00:34:52.755
This wasn't part of the plan.

00:34:57.185 --> 00:34:59.295
They're probably people from Chaeum.

00:35:00.825 --> 00:35:03.125
They can't lay a hand on me anyway, so...

00:35:14.875 --> 00:35:17.715
Woo Gyeom. Stay put.

00:35:18.875 --> 00:35:19.875
Counselor.

00:35:24.355 --> 00:35:25.355
Hold on.

00:35:25.985 --> 00:35:26.985
Wait a minute.

00:35:29.525 --> 00:35:30.525
You people...

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:33.895
Do you have any idea
what you've just done?

00:35:34.865 --> 00:35:36.025
Step aside, Counselor.

00:35:36.665 --> 00:35:38.035
We're just here for Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:35:38.995 --> 00:35:39.995
You people.

00:35:40.495 --> 00:35:43.205
Why on earth are you doing this?

00:35:43.735 --> 00:35:46.935
- Do we need a reason to save a life?
- What?

00:35:52.415 --> 00:35:54.075
- Counselor!
- Reporter Jo.

00:35:59.115 --> 00:36:03.255
Are you all right?
Gosh, hold on. Wait, wait a minute.

00:36:03.885 --> 00:36:04.895
Hold on.

00:36:05.655 --> 00:36:07.525
Woo Gyeom is hurt.
We need to move him, fast.

00:36:07.595 --> 00:36:10.425
I'll do my best to hold them off.
Take my car and get him out of here.

00:36:10.495 --> 00:36:11.495
Okay.

00:36:13.765 --> 00:36:14.765
Woo Gyeom, let's go.

00:36:15.805 --> 00:36:17.975
Hey, hold on. You can deal with me.

00:36:18.235 --> 00:36:21.275
- Why are you folks acting like this?
- Get him.

00:36:23.605 --> 00:36:26.775
- Hurry, get in.
- Come on.

00:36:27.715 --> 00:36:29.415
Gosh, it's been a while.

00:36:29.515 --> 00:36:31.555
I guess I'm about to punch some people
instead of typing with my keyboard.

00:36:59.075 --> 00:37:01.915
Gosh, you're good.

00:37:02.915 --> 00:37:04.555
Are you still having fun?

00:37:21.735 --> 00:37:23.765
Woo Gyeom. Hey, Woo Gyeom!

00:37:26.135 --> 00:37:27.435
We're almost there. Stay with me.

00:37:36.615 --> 00:37:37.955
Hey, Woo Gyeom.

00:37:39.055 --> 00:37:40.055
Come on, snap out of it. Let's get out.

00:37:40.755 --> 00:37:41.755
Let's go.

00:37:57.835 --> 00:37:59.435
Hey, hey. Get up.

00:38:00.005 --> 00:38:01.645
Stay with me. Are you okay?

00:38:02.745 --> 00:38:03.745
Come on.

00:38:15.185 --> 00:38:16.185
Honey.

00:38:29.905 --> 00:38:31.505
What took you so long?

00:38:33.635 --> 00:38:35.405
He got hurt. Can you check his wound?

00:38:36.245 --> 00:38:37.245
Oh, my.

00:38:49.855 --> 00:38:50.955
You must be Min Seo.

00:38:58.595 --> 00:39:02.505
Hey... Let's treat your wounds first.

00:39:02.905 --> 00:39:04.435
Yes. Let's stop the bleeding first.

00:39:05.205 --> 00:39:06.205
Min Seo...

00:39:07.705 --> 00:39:09.305
I need to treat Min Seo first.

00:40:42.135 --> 00:40:43.135
Min Seo.

00:40:58.155 --> 00:40:59.615
(Prosecutor Cha Yi Yeon)

00:41:10.395 --> 00:41:11.495
Hey. Lee Woo Gyeom.

00:41:11.795 --> 00:41:14.095
- Lee Woo Gyeom!
- No!

00:41:22.045 --> 00:41:25.045
You were so confident.
What are you going to do now?

00:41:26.845 --> 00:41:30.785
The stock won't just be halved.
It'll be completely worthless.

00:41:32.015 --> 00:41:33.755
And forget about developing a cure.

00:41:35.025 --> 00:41:36.225
Lee Woo Gyeom escaped.

00:41:38.025 --> 00:41:40.555
Why did Prosecutor Cha raid Chaeum?

00:41:43.425 --> 00:41:46.465
Chairman Chae Jeong Su.
Well? What's your excuse?

00:41:47.235 --> 00:41:50.665
The son of a gun you were protecting
got hauled off by Prosecutor Cha.

00:41:51.835 --> 00:41:54.875
Did you forget that if you go down,
we go down with you?

00:41:55.445 --> 00:41:58.015
If you're holding something back,
spit it out now.

00:41:59.215 --> 00:42:01.645
I knew this would happen.

00:42:02.645 --> 00:42:05.655
A man who keeps a mere congressman
on a leash,

00:42:05.755 --> 00:42:08.485
and the dog itself. What's the difference?

00:42:09.485 --> 00:42:10.955
So undignified.

00:42:16.925 --> 00:42:17.935
Chairman Chae.

00:42:19.465 --> 00:42:20.595
What are you going to do?

00:42:27.605 --> 00:42:29.345
Just give me until the end of the day.

00:42:30.145 --> 00:42:31.675
Once I get Lee Woo Gyeom back,

00:42:32.545 --> 00:42:34.015
everything will go back to normal.

00:42:35.415 --> 00:42:38.455
But is developing the cure even possible?

00:42:40.585 --> 00:42:41.955
Come on.

00:42:42.725 --> 00:42:44.625
You should've handled things properly
from the get-go.

00:42:45.295 --> 00:42:46.295
Mister.

00:42:50.325 --> 00:42:51.865
It's not like this costs us pocket change.

00:42:52.435 --> 00:42:54.835
In a situation like this,
do you really expect me to be polite?

00:42:58.475 --> 00:43:01.945
She asked if the cure's development
is a sure thing.

00:43:11.685 --> 00:43:12.715
You'll see when I get back.

00:43:13.685 --> 00:43:15.285
I'll prove it right before your eyes.

00:43:20.655 --> 00:43:21.665
My goodness.

00:43:23.795 --> 00:43:25.735
What should we do
about Chairman Chae, sir?

00:43:27.195 --> 00:43:29.265
If you feel conflicted
because of your daughter,

00:43:29.535 --> 00:43:30.965
I can deal with Chairman Chae myself.

00:43:31.265 --> 00:43:32.275
Don't you worry about it.

00:43:34.745 --> 00:43:36.145
I'll handle this myself.

00:43:51.595 --> 00:43:53.595
