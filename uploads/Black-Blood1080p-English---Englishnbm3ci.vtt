01:07.541 --> 01:10.041
- I'll take this one inside.
- Thank you.

01:12.916 --> 01:14.500
Help out, will you?

01:20.125 --> 01:20.958
Excuse me.

01:21.041 --> 01:22.250
Yes, hello.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.666
- Can I have one?
- You'll get one later.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.916
- Sir.
- Yes.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.333
- All set?
- Yes, I'll add some more.

01:33.416 --> 01:36.333
- Send those coffees outside.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:36.416 --> 01:39.750
- Is everything ready?
- In a moment, ma'am.

01:42.250 --> 01:45.666
- Are these cakes enough?
- It'll last until this evening, ma'am.

01:45.750 --> 01:46.916
Thank you.

01:50.541 --> 01:53.041
Ladies, do you have enough vegetables?

01:53.125 --> 01:54.666
Yes, we do, ma'am.

01:54.750 --> 01:55.583
Thank you.

01:55.666 --> 01:57.250
It needs to be cool.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.125
Yes. Add more rose petals.

01:59.208 --> 02:01.291
So it feels more bridal.

02:02.375 --> 02:05.125
Please handle everything nicely.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.916
Yes, of course.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.041
Thank you.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.625
Yes.

02:16.916 --> 02:18.875
You look beautiful.

02:18.958 --> 02:21.000
Mom.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.750
We're done, miss.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.541
Thank you very much.

02:30.583 --> 02:35.041
Your late father must be proud of you now.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.250
I know, Mom.

02:37.333 --> 02:40.541
Dad must be proud of you too.

02:40.625 --> 02:43.000
You raised me on your own

02:43.083 --> 02:45.125
and now I'm all grown up.

02:48.541 --> 02:50.208
Rina.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.583
After you get married,

02:52.666 --> 02:54.708
I can't take care of you anymore.

02:56.083 --> 02:58.166
Marriage

02:58.250 --> 03:01.083
is not just wedding vows and parties.

03:01.166 --> 03:04.208
It's a long journey.

03:04.291 --> 03:06.166
You have to make sure

03:06.250 --> 03:08.333
nothing from the past
is still haunting you.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.625
If you have unfinished business,

03:12.708 --> 03:15.541
maybe someone from the past,

03:15.625 --> 03:18.458
from your side or Pram's,

03:18.541 --> 03:20.500
you need to end things.

03:22.041 --> 03:25.000
I'm sure there's nothing wrong, Mom.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.125
Thank God then.

03:29.916 --> 03:33.958
I just want you to be truly happy.

03:35.708 --> 03:38.208
Thank you so much, Mom.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.125
All right then.

03:41.208 --> 03:42.958
The event is about to start.

04:31.541 --> 04:33.125
Did the power go out?

04:33.208 --> 04:34.958
I think so.

04:37.875 --> 04:40.625
Please check. We're about to start.

04:40.708 --> 04:42.416
Yes, ma'am.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.000
Mom, what's going on?

04:44.083 --> 04:47.000
Looks like a short circuit.
Mr. Pono is checking.

04:47.083 --> 04:48.708
Just stay in your room.

04:48.791 --> 04:49.750
Okay.

05:47.583 --> 05:49.125
Who is there?

06:05.750 --> 06:07.125
Is something wrong, miss?

06:07.208 --> 06:08.375
No, nothing.

07:22.583 --> 07:23.583
My gosh.

07:23.666 --> 07:24.875
Mom!

07:24.958 --> 07:26.125
- Look!
- What is it?

07:26.208 --> 07:27.833
What is it, Rina?

07:27.916 --> 07:30.083
- My God.
- My God.

07:30.708 --> 07:32.375
- Why is there a mouse?
- What is it?

07:32.458 --> 07:35.583
Sir, why is the water black?

07:49.708 --> 07:51.500
It looks like blood.

07:51.583 --> 07:52.791
What blood?

07:52.875 --> 07:54.875
Why is it black?

07:55.625 --> 07:57.416
I don't understand.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.166
This is a bad omen.

08:18.583 --> 08:23.375
<i>How does it feel</i>
<i>to be back in Wonosobo, Ms. Manager?</i>

08:23.458 --> 08:25.666
Honestly, I don't remember anymore.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.541
But it feels the same.

08:27.625 --> 08:30.458
Cool. Clean.

08:31.083 --> 08:35.458
But I'm not a manager anymore.
I'm the manager's wife.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.958
Well, still a manager then.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.333
- Rin.
- Yes?

08:44.416 --> 08:45.750
Thank you.

08:45.833 --> 08:49.791
You sacrificed for us.

08:49.875 --> 08:51.875
You left your job.

08:51.958 --> 08:55.833
I got tired
of getting transferred here and there.

08:56.750 --> 09:00.208
Thank God you got promoted

09:00.291 --> 09:02.791
and moved to the Wonosobo office.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.750
They provided a house too.

09:04.833 --> 09:07.833
Yes, thank God, Rin.

09:16.708 --> 09:17.541
Rin.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.333
What is it?

09:22.250 --> 09:25.625
I was thinking about what happened
before the ceremony.

09:25.708 --> 09:30.333
Rin, we've talked about that a lot.

09:30.416 --> 09:33.708
There are no such things as ghosts.

09:34.666 --> 09:37.791
But the people at home
are thinking the same thing.

09:37.875 --> 09:40.166
The mirror cracked

09:40.250 --> 09:42.833
because it was poorly made.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.375
The power went out
due to a short circuit or overload.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.500
And the photo fell
because it just wasn't hung properly.

09:51.375 --> 09:54.875
What about the mud? The mouse?

09:54.958 --> 09:57.250
The water that turned black?

09:57.333 --> 09:59.625
Your mother said that

09:59.708 --> 10:02.375
she had an argument
with the neighbor next door.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.958
She thinks they did it.
They aren't nice people anyway.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.125
Besides, Rin,

10:10.208 --> 10:14.083
to this day, everything has been fine.

10:14.166 --> 10:15.791
Nobody got hurt, right?

10:19.250 --> 10:20.458
Rin.

10:21.208 --> 10:23.916
There are many other important things

10:24.000 --> 10:27.041
that we need to think about.

10:27.125 --> 10:29.041
Our new life.

10:30.833 --> 10:33.541
I can't wait to have children with you.

10:33.625 --> 10:35.666
Me too.

10:35.750 --> 10:37.541
- Two.
- Two?

10:37.625 --> 10:39.708
I want 11.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.375
Dear!

10:59.458 --> 11:01.166
They're here!

11:01.250 --> 11:03.250
It's Mr. Pram!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.416
My hands are dirty.

11:09.500 --> 11:10.791
- Sir.
- Mr. Pram.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.166
How are you?

11:12.250 --> 11:13.708
We're doing well, sir.

11:13.791 --> 11:15.875
- Thank God.
- How was the trip?

11:15.958 --> 11:18.250
Thank God it went smoothly.

11:18.333 --> 11:19.500
- Thank God.
- Now.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.250
Meet my wife, Rina.

11:21.333 --> 11:24.791
Rin, Mr. Muri and Mrs. Dar
were hired by the office

11:24.875 --> 11:27.750
to help clean the house once a week.

11:27.833 --> 11:28.916
They live nearby.

11:29.000 --> 11:29.875
Over there.

11:29.958 --> 11:31.375
Please come in.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.208
The house is ready and cleaned.
Shining like a diamond!

11:34.291 --> 11:35.166
Come in.

11:35.250 --> 11:38.041
- Peace be upon you.
- And upon you too.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.625
The lights have been replaced
with new ones.

11:42.708 --> 11:44.166
Right.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.125
- The room is ready too.
- Right.

11:46.208 --> 11:47.583
Yes.

11:55.958 --> 11:57.500
- Ma'am.
- Yes, sir.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.375
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.333
What is this?

12:10.541 --> 12:11.666
- Dear.
- Yes?

12:11.750 --> 12:13.958
- Dear!
- Yes, dear?

12:14.583 --> 12:17.041
- What is it?
- Why is there mud here?

12:17.125 --> 12:19.291
I already mopped this room.
It should be clean.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.125
Then what is this?

12:21.208 --> 12:23.166
It's all right.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.000
Please just clean it.

12:25.083 --> 12:27.000
- Yes, of course.
- Yes, sir.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.833
- I'm going to check the bedroom.
- Okay.

13:03.458 --> 13:05.625
It's so hot.

13:05.708 --> 13:08.791
Don't we have a fan?

13:08.875 --> 13:10.708
We don't.

13:12.833 --> 13:15.000
I'll ask the office tomorrow.

13:27.041 --> 13:28.541
Excuse me, Mrs. Rina.

13:28.625 --> 13:31.375
Mrs. Dar, what is it?

13:31.458 --> 13:35.875
Are you going to hold a housewarming?

13:35.958 --> 13:38.083
If so, Mr. Muri and I,

13:38.166 --> 13:39.958
along with the neighbors,
are ready to help.

13:41.375 --> 13:42.583
Yes, we're doing it.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.041
Thank you so much.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.333
Of course. You're welcome.

13:47.375 --> 13:48.666
Well…

13:49.583 --> 13:51.833
You got a fan?

13:51.916 --> 13:54.000
From Pram's office.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.041
It was hot last night.

13:56.916 --> 14:00.083
What? That's strange.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.791
People rarely say

14:02.875 --> 14:04.875
that it's hot here.

14:04.958 --> 14:06.791
It's always chilly here.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.541
Please come in.

14:17.625 --> 14:20.250
Just put it there.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.541
Mrs. Dar, the fritters are done.

14:22.625 --> 14:24.833
Right. Please fill the glasses
with coffee.

14:24.916 --> 14:26.083
All right.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.041
Hello?

14:32.125 --> 14:34.625
<i>Rin, I'm coming home late.</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:37.125
I need to get
some work done at the office.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.958
When the ustad comes later,

14:39.041 --> 14:41.708
please make him some ginger tea.

14:41.791 --> 14:43.083
It's his favorite.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.541
All right.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.250
- There she is.
- Hello.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.333
Peace be upon you, sir.

15:22.250 --> 15:23.458
Come with me.

15:38.125 --> 15:40.500
Please have a seat.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.791
My husband will be late.

15:56.875 --> 16:00.125
Would you like some ginger tea?

16:01.291 --> 16:03.833
Or just plain tea?

16:04.833 --> 16:08.375
All right then. I'll be right back.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.833
- Mr. Muri.
- Yes.

16:48.916 --> 16:50.500
Where is the ustad?

16:50.583 --> 16:51.875
Ustad?

16:51.958 --> 16:55.125
Yes, he was waiting inside.

16:57.666 --> 17:00.083
I'm not sure.

17:00.166 --> 17:02.791
He was wearing all black.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.583
He doesn't usually wear black.

17:05.666 --> 17:07.791
He usually wears white.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.666
- Hold this.
- Okay.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.208
Pram.

17:25.291 --> 17:26.250
Rin.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.708
This is the ustad.

17:29.791 --> 17:33.375
I happened to meet him on the way here,
so I gave him a ride.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.458
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

17:38.083 --> 17:39.458
- Let's go, Rin.
- Sir.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.208
- Pram.
- Yes.

17:41.875 --> 17:44.666
There was an old man.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.541
I thought he was the ustad.

17:46.625 --> 17:47.708
He waited inside.

17:49.791 --> 17:51.625
Maybe it's just a neighbor.

17:52.791 --> 17:55.750
Let's go inside. It's time to start.

17:56.541 --> 17:58.375
Mr. Muri, please move the car.

17:58.458 --> 18:01.500
Let's start our prayer

18:01.583 --> 18:04.541
- by reciting Al-Fatihah.
- Yes.

18:04.625 --> 18:08.750
Hopefully, Mr. Pram and Mrs. Rina

18:08.833 --> 18:13.208
- will always be blessed in this house.
- Yes.

18:13.291 --> 18:16.333
- Amen.
- Amen.

18:16.416 --> 18:18.166
Al-Fatihah.

18:18.250 --> 18:22.541
I seek refuge in Allah from shaitan,
the accursed one.

18:22.625 --> 18:26.375
In the name of Allah, the Most
Compassionate, the Most Merciful.

18:26.458 --> 18:30.875
All praise is for Allah,
Lord of all worlds,

18:30.958 --> 18:34.125
the Most Compassionate, Most Merciful,

18:34.208 --> 18:37.125
Master of the Day of Judgment.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.208
You alone we worship
and You alone we ask for help…

19:05.083 --> 19:08.416
Pram, over there! The old man!

19:08.500 --> 19:09.708
What?

19:14.833 --> 19:15.916
Excuse me for a moment.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.541
Excuse me.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.291
What's wrong, Rin?

19:40.375 --> 19:42.416
Someone was standing there.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.083
There's nothing here.

20:04.416 --> 20:05.583
Pram.

20:05.666 --> 20:08.375
I'm still thinking
about the old man from last night.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.083
Why was I the only one who could see him?

20:12.166 --> 20:13.416
Rin.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.958
Mr. Muri and the neighbors
are still trying to find the old man

20:16.041 --> 20:18.500
who fits the characteristics
you described.

20:18.583 --> 20:20.750
But they're pretty sure

20:20.833 --> 20:24.041
that there's no one here
who looks like that.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.375
Then who is he?

20:27.458 --> 20:29.625
Why did he point at me?

20:30.375 --> 20:34.291
Maybe he got lost

20:34.375 --> 20:36.000
or he was just messing around.

20:37.916 --> 20:39.000
Listen.

20:40.291 --> 20:43.208
Don't worry about it.

20:46.708 --> 20:48.875
From now on,

20:48.958 --> 20:51.416
just close all the doors and windows.

20:52.166 --> 20:54.166
Lock up if necessary.

20:54.250 --> 20:57.541
God willing, we will be safe, Rin.

21:00.416 --> 21:02.416
I have to go, okay?

21:02.500 --> 21:04.958
- Be careful.
- I will.

23:48.375 --> 23:50.666
I want you!

24:02.125 --> 24:03.875
Rin.

24:05.250 --> 24:06.958
Rin, what's wrong?

24:07.041 --> 24:09.166
The old man.

24:09.250 --> 24:11.166
The old man is here.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.791
What? What old man, Rin?

24:13.875 --> 24:16.416
There is no old man.

24:16.500 --> 24:19.333
- I'm scared.
- It was just a dream.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.708
Calm down, Rin.

24:21.791 --> 24:23.791
All right, Rin.

24:23.875 --> 24:28.416
I will talk
to Mr. Muri and Mrs. Dar tomorrow.

24:29.625 --> 24:33.083
I'll tell them to stay here

24:33.833 --> 24:35.708
to keep you company.

24:36.625 --> 24:37.708
Okay?

24:43.875 --> 24:48.541
7 WEEKS LATER

24:50.208 --> 24:52.166
Please try it, Mrs. Rina.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.375
Mrs. Dar.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.875
Add a little nutmeg and sugar.

25:03.958 --> 25:07.041
Yes, it'll make it more delicious.

25:16.666 --> 25:17.750
What's wrong, Mrs. Rina?

25:21.333 --> 25:23.375
Later, would you please

25:23.458 --> 25:26.166
check the harvest data

25:26.250 --> 25:28.041
- from last month?
- Yes.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.791
- Then coordinate with the factory.
- Yes, sir.

25:30.875 --> 25:33.291
- Mr. Pram.
- Yes?

25:34.083 --> 25:37.208
I'm sorry. You've got a phone call.

25:37.291 --> 25:38.666
Yes, thank you.

25:43.666 --> 25:44.666
Hello?

25:44.750 --> 25:47.875
<i>Hello, Mr. Pram. Sorry to bother you.</i>

25:47.958 --> 25:50.083
But it seems like Mrs. Rina is sick.

25:50.166 --> 25:51.958
She's been vomiting.

25:52.041 --> 25:53.416
She feels feverish.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.916
What's wrong with my wife, doctor?

26:07.000 --> 26:09.041
Mrs. Rina is not sick,

26:09.125 --> 26:10.166
but pregnant.

26:14.125 --> 26:16.708
- Thank God.
- Congratulations, sir.

26:16.791 --> 26:18.375
Congratulations, ma'am.

26:19.041 --> 26:22.166
Based on the first day
of your last period,

26:22.250 --> 26:26.000
your pregnancy is seven weeks old.

26:31.833 --> 26:35.250
When do you think

26:35.333 --> 26:37.958
we'll start to feel the baby move?

26:38.583 --> 26:41.000
The doctor said 20 weeks.

26:41.625 --> 26:45.333
But surely from now on,
he or she will be able to hear us.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.416
Sweetheart.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.458
Stay healthy, okay?

26:51.541 --> 26:56.958
Mom and Dad love you.

27:13.875 --> 27:14.875
Hello.

27:14.958 --> 27:18.000
Rin, I still have to work overtime
at the office.

27:18.083 --> 27:19.958
Go ahead and eat.

27:20.041 --> 27:23.375
Then just go to bed.
No need to wait for me.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.375
Okay then.

27:26.458 --> 27:28.375
Good luck with your work.

27:28.458 --> 27:29.916
And take care.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.250
Okay.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.083
Rin.

27:35.416 --> 27:37.333
I…

27:37.416 --> 27:39.500
I love you.

27:41.708 --> 27:44.875
I love you too, so much.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Ma'am.

27:56.083 --> 27:58.166
- Yes.
- Clean it up, please.

27:58.250 --> 27:59.375
I'm not hungry.

27:59.458 --> 28:01.125
Yes, of course.

28:08.166 --> 28:09.541
Mrs. Dar, Mr. Muri.

28:09.625 --> 28:10.750
- Yes.
- Yes.

28:10.833 --> 28:12.833
Did someone come in?

28:14.000 --> 28:15.250
What is it?

28:15.333 --> 28:17.166
I'm not sure.

28:17.250 --> 28:19.166
I didn't see anybody.

28:19.250 --> 28:20.416
Was it you?

28:20.500 --> 28:23.208
It wasn't me.

28:23.291 --> 28:25.166
Maybe it was a cat.

28:25.250 --> 28:29.708
What do you mean, a cat?
It's clearly your footprints.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.458
My feet are clean.

28:31.541 --> 28:33.833
- I swear.
- Okay.

28:33.916 --> 28:35.833
Please just clean it.

28:35.916 --> 28:37.500
- Yes.
- Yes, Mrs. Rina.

29:20.041 --> 29:21.750
Mr. Muri.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.000
Mrs. Dar.

30:43.291 --> 30:44.833
Mrs. Dar!

30:47.000 --> 30:48.708
Mr. Muri!

31:45.958 --> 31:47.291
What is it, Rin?

31:47.375 --> 31:49.666
Rina, what is it?

31:49.750 --> 31:50.875
The old man.

31:50.958 --> 31:53.625
My God.

31:53.708 --> 31:55.625
It's just a dream.

31:55.708 --> 31:57.083
Calm down.

31:57.166 --> 31:59.666
You're okay. Calm down.

32:01.708 --> 32:02.541
Rin.

32:03.541 --> 32:04.666
Rina.

32:05.625 --> 32:06.958
What's wrong?

32:07.916 --> 32:08.916
Rin.

32:15.875 --> 32:17.166
Rin.

32:17.250 --> 32:19.041
Let's go to the doctor now.

32:21.708 --> 32:23.250
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Rina.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.625
We couldn't save the baby.

32:25.708 --> 32:27.458
Please excuse me.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.208
Stay strong, Rin.

32:37.791 --> 32:40.041
The doctor said that

32:40.125 --> 32:42.916
you can still get pregnant again.

32:44.041 --> 32:46.666
But the most important thing now

32:46.750 --> 32:48.958
is to recover first.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.666
Rin.

32:55.291 --> 32:57.125
Something's wrong.

32:59.666 --> 33:02.375
I've taken care of it as best as I could.

33:02.458 --> 33:05.125
I was never too tired.

33:06.750 --> 33:09.416
I watched what I ate.

33:10.958 --> 33:14.208
How could this happen?

33:17.708 --> 33:22.250
Maybe God just hasn't given us
His blessing yet, Rin.

33:23.125 --> 33:25.916
This is all beyond our control.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.500
The old man.

33:32.583 --> 33:34.458
The old man, Pram.

33:35.375 --> 33:37.583
The old man ate our baby.

33:38.583 --> 33:39.541
Rin.

33:40.166 --> 33:42.500
Don't think about things that aren't real.

33:44.708 --> 33:48.000
We just haven't been blessed
to have children, Rin.

33:48.083 --> 33:51.500
All of this must be connected.

33:53.958 --> 33:55.625
This is the proof.

33:58.625 --> 33:59.583
Rin.

34:00.416 --> 34:02.083
You got that scar

34:02.166 --> 34:05.166
from gripping your stomach too tightly.

34:05.250 --> 34:08.000
You did that with your own nails.

34:08.083 --> 34:09.041
No.

34:10.291 --> 34:13.041
It is all related.

34:21.541 --> 34:22.458
Rin.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.041
I have to go, okay?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.500
Get some rest.

34:32.791 --> 34:34.208
Take care, Pram.

34:35.458 --> 34:36.666
I will.

34:59.958 --> 35:00.958
Mr. Muri.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.416
Yes, Mrs. Rina.

35:03.500 --> 35:05.333
Do you know anyone who is psychic?

35:09.458 --> 35:10.416
I do.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.333
Does he do home visits?

35:12.916 --> 35:14.000
Yes.

35:15.958 --> 35:17.625
<i>Please call him over.</i>

35:17.708 --> 35:19.583
<i>But don't let Pram know.</i>

35:19.666 --> 35:21.041
<i>Yes, Mrs. Rina.</i>

35:29.208 --> 35:31.041
Mrs. Rina.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.333
Mr. Narto has arrived.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.583
- Please, sir.
- Yes.

35:37.333 --> 35:40.375
Mrs. Rina, this is Mr. Narto.

35:41.166 --> 35:44.083
Sir, thank you for coming.

35:44.166 --> 35:45.583
You're welcome.

35:45.666 --> 35:47.833
- Please.
- Yes, thank you.

35:48.791 --> 35:50.708
- The drinks.
- Yes.

36:10.375 --> 36:12.208
Please excuse me.

36:12.291 --> 36:15.208
I have to see with my third eye.

36:18.791 --> 36:22.875
I come in peace, with respect.

36:22.958 --> 36:24.500
Forgive my intrusion.

36:25.583 --> 36:29.541
I ask you to please show me

36:29.625 --> 36:31.916
what is in this woman's body

36:32.000 --> 36:35.041
and what's in this house.

36:37.250 --> 36:38.291
Yes.

36:40.791 --> 36:42.291
Yes, thank you.

36:47.125 --> 36:49.291
You were right, Mrs. Rina.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.041
There is indeed something wrong.

36:54.250 --> 36:55.291
Witchcraft.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.625
For now, I can't be sure

36:59.708 --> 37:02.375
what kind of black magic this is.

37:03.291 --> 37:05.541
So I can't remove it yet.

37:07.500 --> 37:11.083
I can only assure you that
this curse was indeed sent to you.

37:12.166 --> 37:15.625
And the miscarriage you had
was because of this curse.

37:17.375 --> 37:20.500
For now, all I can do for you

37:21.541 --> 37:23.458
is to give you protection.

37:28.291 --> 37:33.458
<i>Mrs. Rina, put these</i>
<i>around the corners of the house.</i>

37:34.750 --> 37:39.041
<i>It's to protect you from black magic.</i>

37:40.750 --> 37:43.083
<i>And most importantly,</i>

37:43.875 --> 37:46.666
<i>don't forget to pray.</i>

37:48.000 --> 37:50.875
<i>Ask Allah for protection.</i>

37:58.750 --> 38:00.500
A FEW MONTHS LATER…

38:00.583 --> 38:02.125
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Pram.</i>

38:02.208 --> 38:05.208
Yes, of course.

38:05.291 --> 38:08.416
Let's go!

38:09.833 --> 38:12.250
Where are you taking that?

38:12.333 --> 38:13.583
I'm changing it.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.541
This one has caterpillars.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.791
I see.

38:26.583 --> 38:28.416
- Mr. Muri.
- Yes.

38:29.250 --> 38:30.500
What's wrong?

38:30.583 --> 38:31.875
What is this?

38:33.541 --> 38:36.625
I'm not sure.

38:36.708 --> 38:38.416
I don't know.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.250
You.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.875
You secretly brought a shaman
into our home.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.666
I was trying to protect us, Pram.

39:05.500 --> 39:10.250
And the old man has never appeared
in my dreams again.

39:10.333 --> 39:13.583
- There's no harm in trying, right?
- Rin.

39:13.666 --> 39:16.708
How many times do I have to tell you?

39:18.000 --> 39:21.750
There are no such things as ghosts!

39:29.250 --> 39:30.875
Pram!

39:32.208 --> 39:33.375
I don't want to see

39:33.458 --> 39:36.791
things like this in our house.

42:31.125 --> 42:34.208
I want you.

42:45.166 --> 42:46.500
Dear.

42:46.583 --> 42:48.375
What's that sound, dear?

42:49.125 --> 42:50.625
- What is that?
- I don't know.

42:50.708 --> 42:52.291
Pram!

42:52.375 --> 42:54.041
Pram, it's the old man!

42:54.125 --> 42:55.541
- Pram!
- What is it, Rin?

42:55.625 --> 42:57.791
- The old man.
- What old man?

43:00.791 --> 43:02.083
What old man?

43:05.750 --> 43:07.166
What is it, Rin?

43:14.625 --> 43:15.708
What?

43:17.208 --> 43:18.791
Over there!

43:38.291 --> 43:41.250
- What's wrong, Mrs. Rina?
- Mr. Muri, please accompany Pram.

43:41.333 --> 43:42.291
- Yes.
- Quickly, dear.

43:52.708 --> 43:55.875
- Mr. Muri, please get me a ladder!
- Right.

44:17.416 --> 44:18.791
What's wrong?

44:25.208 --> 44:26.333
Mr. Pram.

44:26.416 --> 44:27.750
What's that?

44:28.666 --> 44:30.375
I don't know.

44:35.708 --> 44:37.208
What is that, Pram?

44:37.291 --> 44:38.500
I don't know.

44:44.041 --> 44:46.541
There is no one up there. Only this.

44:48.333 --> 44:50.583
My God.

44:51.166 --> 44:52.833
My God.

44:52.916 --> 44:54.625
This is dangerous.

44:54.708 --> 44:56.333
It looks like witchcraft.

45:05.750 --> 45:07.708
This is soil from a grave.

45:09.333 --> 45:12.166
Black blood from a rat.

45:12.958 --> 45:15.625
This is not just any witchcraft.

45:17.000 --> 45:18.500
It's the black blood curse.

45:22.291 --> 45:25.416
This curse targets
your blood and descendants.

45:26.333 --> 45:29.125
So if you get pregnant,

45:29.208 --> 45:32.458
you will definitely miscarry
and it will keep happening.

45:33.583 --> 45:35.083
Does that mean

45:35.166 --> 45:38.541
we will never be able to have children?

45:39.916 --> 45:41.750
I'm afraid so.

45:47.500 --> 45:48.833
Who…

45:51.250 --> 45:53.041
Who did it?

45:53.875 --> 45:56.125
I don't know who sent it yet.

45:56.208 --> 46:01.166
I do know that this curse was sent
by someone who was truly hurt

46:01.250 --> 46:02.125
to get revenge.

46:04.083 --> 46:05.083
Sir.

46:05.166 --> 46:07.083
Can it be removed?

46:09.958 --> 46:11.375
It's not that easy.

46:12.250 --> 46:13.833
The only way

46:13.916 --> 46:17.625
is by finding the object that is
the center of the power of this curse.

46:18.500 --> 46:21.250
Only then can the removal ritual
be performed.

46:22.333 --> 46:23.833
An object?

46:23.916 --> 46:26.500
Yes, an object.

46:27.208 --> 46:29.041
Like this clay jar.

46:30.541 --> 46:34.083
It is usually planted in the house
of the person who sent the curse.

46:37.875 --> 46:39.791
Mrs. Rina.

46:39.875 --> 46:41.125
Do you think

46:42.791 --> 46:47.541
there is someone who doesn't like you
and holds a grudge against you?

46:57.333 --> 46:58.375
Rin.

47:14.375 --> 47:15.416
Rin.

47:17.041 --> 47:19.375
Can you think of anyone?

47:24.666 --> 47:27.541
I was thinking about what Mom said

47:27.625 --> 47:31.083
regarding unresolved problems
in the past, Pram.

47:36.250 --> 47:39.125
Before I dated you,

47:39.208 --> 47:41.166
I once dated someone.

47:42.333 --> 47:44.083
His name is Yudi.

47:46.208 --> 47:49.041
I never told you

47:49.125 --> 47:51.708
because I don't want to remember him.

47:53.000 --> 47:55.000
He was obsessed with me.

47:57.916 --> 48:00.291
Do you know where he is now?

48:01.958 --> 48:04.375
I dated him for six months

48:04.458 --> 48:06.916
when I was placed in Semarang.

48:09.666 --> 48:12.833
When we finally decided to part ways,

48:12.916 --> 48:14.625
he couldn't accept it.

48:16.041 --> 48:17.791
He followed me,

48:17.875 --> 48:19.583
stalked me,

48:20.375 --> 48:23.958
and everything stopped
when I moved to Solo and met you.

48:26.083 --> 48:29.208
I haven't heard from him again until now.

48:31.666 --> 48:34.458
But he once told me

48:35.625 --> 48:39.458
that he wouldn't stay silent
if I married someone else.

48:41.666 --> 48:44.250
This must be his doing.

48:50.125 --> 48:52.500
We have to find him

48:56.166 --> 48:57.833
and make sure

48:58.500 --> 49:00.958
to remove this curse.

49:01.875 --> 49:03.416
- Hello, Sinta.
<i>- Yes.</i>

49:03.500 --> 49:05.625
- This is Rina.
<i>- Hi, Rina. What's going on?</i>

49:05.708 --> 49:08.916
Do you know how Yudi is doing now?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.541
<i>Yudi? I'm not sure.</i>

49:12.416 --> 49:14.875
Akbar, you still remember Yudi, right?

49:14.958 --> 49:16.875
<i>Yudi? Who do you mean?</i>

49:16.958 --> 49:19.500
We were coworkers back then in Semarang.

49:19.583 --> 49:22.333
Don, if you meet Yudi, let me know, okay?

49:22.416 --> 49:25.625
<i>- Okay. Where should I reach you?</i>
- Call this number.

49:25.708 --> 49:29.625
<i>Rina, have you heard about Yudi?</i>
<i>He was arrested by the police.</i>

49:29.708 --> 49:31.041
Arrested by the police?

49:31.125 --> 49:33.916
<i>Yeah. He was arrested in Jakarta.</i>

49:34.000 --> 49:35.833
All right, thanks.

49:38.916 --> 49:40.333
Who was that?

49:41.083 --> 49:43.458
Yudi was once arrested in Jakarta.

49:43.541 --> 49:45.250
I don't know why.

49:45.958 --> 49:49.208
After he was released,
no one knew where he was.

49:51.541 --> 49:55.625
How about we ask the police for help?

49:59.416 --> 50:02.791
1981, RINA'S 7 MONTHS OF PREGNANCY

50:10.541 --> 50:12.916
Allah is the Greatest.

50:14.541 --> 50:16.125
<i>Sweetheart.</i>

50:16.208 --> 50:17.916
Stay healthy, okay?

50:18.000 --> 50:22.166
You have made Mom and Dad very happy.

50:22.250 --> 50:26.583
When you grow up,

50:26.666 --> 50:29.458
be someone who's helpful.

50:29.541 --> 50:31.250
Do good to others.

50:31.916 --> 50:34.000
Amen.

50:36.875 --> 50:38.208
Pram.

50:38.750 --> 50:41.250
Have you heard from the police?

50:43.541 --> 50:44.625
Not yet.

50:53.125 --> 50:54.125
Hello?

50:54.208 --> 50:57.666
<i>Hi, Rina. This is Sinta.</i>

50:57.750 --> 51:00.083
Sinta? So?

51:00.166 --> 51:03.625
<i>It's about Yudi.</i>
<i>He's at his sister's house in Slawi.</i>

51:04.333 --> 51:05.833
Thank you, Sin.

51:08.625 --> 51:11.000
- Any updates, Rin?
- It's Yudi.

51:11.083 --> 51:13.791
He's in Slawi, at his sister's house.

51:20.250 --> 51:22.375
<i>Mr. Narto and I will go there.</i>

51:23.708 --> 51:26.833
<i>Stay at home and ask your mom</i>
<i>to come over.</i>

51:49.541 --> 51:50.833
What do you see?

51:51.750 --> 51:55.833
I can't feel
the presence of the object here.

51:56.583 --> 51:57.791
Excuse me.

51:58.708 --> 52:00.416
Excuse us, miss.

52:00.958 --> 52:02.958
Is Yudi there?

52:04.500 --> 52:06.583
I am Yudi's friend.

52:06.666 --> 52:08.666
I have business with him.

52:10.416 --> 52:11.958
Yudi is no longer with us.

52:12.041 --> 52:13.333
What do you mean?

52:13.416 --> 52:14.750
Six months ago,

52:15.375 --> 52:17.458
Yudi had an accident.

52:17.541 --> 52:21.208
The limestone quarry here collapsed.

52:23.875 --> 52:25.125
He died?

52:25.208 --> 52:26.458
<i>Yes, Rin.</i>

52:26.541 --> 52:28.375
Mr. Narto also said that

52:28.458 --> 52:31.291
if the person who sent the curse has died,

52:31.375 --> 52:32.958
the curse should go away.

52:33.666 --> 52:35.875
<i>But it's still there.</i>

52:35.958 --> 52:38.041
So yeah,

52:38.125 --> 52:39.416
Yudi is definitely not the one.

52:42.708 --> 52:44.250
Rin.

52:44.333 --> 52:46.833
Are you suspicious of other people?

52:47.875 --> 52:50.666
I still haven't thought about it.

52:51.291 --> 52:53.416
Maybe your mom knows.

52:53.500 --> 52:56.166
Maybe there's someone
who doesn't like her.

52:56.250 --> 52:57.916
But it got sent to you.

52:58.666 --> 53:00.333
My mom?

53:00.416 --> 53:04.875
I can ask,
but I don't think there is anyone.

53:05.416 --> 53:06.541
<i>All right then.</i>

53:06.625 --> 53:09.958
Mr. Narto and I are still
at the village chief's house.

53:10.041 --> 53:12.208
We're trying to find new information.

53:12.291 --> 53:15.250
If you have other people in mind,
let me know, okay?

53:15.875 --> 53:17.916
Yes, take care, Pram.

53:18.000 --> 53:19.000
I will.

53:25.916 --> 53:28.916
Rin, it might take a while.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.916
You should get some rest.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.291
When Pram and Mr. Narto come home,

53:33.375 --> 53:35.375
I'll talk to them.

53:35.458 --> 53:36.916
Okay, Mom.

53:39.625 --> 53:41.291
What's wrong?

53:41.375 --> 53:42.958
I have cramps.

53:43.041 --> 53:44.750
Can you get Mrs. Dar?

53:44.833 --> 53:47.166
I'll go get some hot water

53:47.250 --> 53:49.208
to soak your feet.

53:49.291 --> 53:50.750
Okay then.

54:11.750 --> 54:12.666
Mom.

54:13.958 --> 54:15.625
Mom.

54:15.708 --> 54:16.708
- Mom?
- Rin!

54:16.791 --> 54:17.791
Mom!

54:18.458 --> 54:19.416
Mom!

54:21.541 --> 54:22.833
- Mom.
- Mrs. Rina.

54:22.916 --> 54:23.833
My God!

54:23.916 --> 54:26.916
Rin! I'm locked inside!

54:27.000 --> 54:28.208
Mrs. Rina?

54:28.791 --> 54:30.166
I can't open it.

54:30.250 --> 54:31.291
Mrs. Rina!

54:31.375 --> 54:32.583
Mom!

54:32.666 --> 54:33.791
Rin!

54:38.583 --> 54:39.666
Mrs. Rina.

54:39.750 --> 54:41.375
- Mrs. Rina.
- Mrs. Rina!

54:43.416 --> 54:44.333
Help her!

54:44.416 --> 54:45.958
- But how?
- Mrs. Rina.

54:46.041 --> 54:47.541
Mrs. Rina!

54:47.625 --> 54:49.375
- Mrs. Rina!
- Mrs. Rina!

54:51.500 --> 54:52.708
Mrs. Rina!

54:52.791 --> 54:54.166
Mrs. Rina!

55:12.333 --> 55:16.125
This child will not be born alive.

55:19.291 --> 55:21.125
Mrs. Rina!

55:21.208 --> 55:22.208
Mr. Pram!

55:22.291 --> 55:23.583
- Mr. Pram!
- Yes.

55:23.666 --> 55:25.958
- Come quickly!
- Okay.

55:40.458 --> 55:41.291
Pram…

55:41.375 --> 55:42.750
Hey!

55:42.833 --> 55:44.500
You creature!

55:44.583 --> 55:48.083
I order you to leave this place.

55:48.166 --> 55:49.833
Leave!

55:51.208 --> 55:52.958
- Leave at once!
- Rin.

55:53.041 --> 55:54.541
- Leave!
- The baby's coming!

55:54.625 --> 55:55.666
Sit down, Rin.

55:56.750 --> 55:59.541
God, forgive us. Please be strong, Rin.

55:59.625 --> 56:01.458
- Please help her.
- Yes.

56:02.791 --> 56:03.750
Help her.

56:03.833 --> 56:05.958
Be strong.
Get a blanket and some hot water!

56:07.583 --> 56:09.000
Leave!

56:11.250 --> 56:12.250
Come on, hurry up!

56:13.416 --> 56:14.500
Here.

56:16.458 --> 56:18.625
Leave. Go!

56:18.708 --> 56:23.333
- You can do it, Rin.
- Yes, Mrs. Rina.

56:24.250 --> 56:27.791
- You can do it, Rin.
- Yes, Mrs. Rina.

56:27.875 --> 56:30.750
- You can do it, Rin.
- Push, Mrs. Rin!

56:36.541 --> 56:38.708
Praise be to God.

56:38.791 --> 56:40.208
You did it, Rin.

56:42.333 --> 56:44.791
With the permission of God Almighty.

56:44.875 --> 56:46.125
Get out of here!

56:47.125 --> 56:48.833
Don't bother us here again!

56:48.916 --> 56:50.500
Go back to where you came from!

57:02.791 --> 57:03.791
Rin.

57:15.125 --> 57:16.666
Rina.

57:16.750 --> 57:21.250
Allah is the Greatest.

57:28.666 --> 57:30.041
The doctor said

57:30.125 --> 57:32.583
her lungs are not fully developed.

57:33.208 --> 57:36.375
She still has to be treated longer
in the hospital.

57:43.458 --> 57:44.625
Mr. Narto.

57:45.666 --> 57:47.875
If the baby is born safely,

57:47.958 --> 57:50.000
then the curse must be gone, right?

57:52.291 --> 57:54.375
I hope so, Mrs. Rina.

57:55.791 --> 57:58.583
But the curse can't possibly disappear

57:58.666 --> 58:01.083
because it has entered your child's blood.

58:03.458 --> 58:06.000
And your child

58:06.083 --> 58:09.416
won't grow like other children.

58:10.541 --> 58:14.333
Everything can go back to normal
only when the curse is removed.

58:17.041 --> 58:18.833
And that old man

58:20.166 --> 58:22.791
will definitely come back again
to take your child

58:22.875 --> 58:24.541
at the time he has set.

58:27.041 --> 58:28.125
When is that?

58:34.291 --> 58:36.083
Seven weeks,

58:36.166 --> 58:37.583
seven months,

58:37.666 --> 58:38.750
seven years.

58:41.791 --> 58:43.500
Your first child

58:43.583 --> 58:47.166
was taken when you were
seven weeks pregnant.

58:47.250 --> 58:49.791
Last night, he came

58:49.875 --> 58:53.458
when you were seven months pregnant.

58:55.375 --> 58:59.125
He will come back again
when your child is seven years old.

59:03.958 --> 59:07.291
1988, 7 YEARS LATER

59:20.666 --> 59:22.166
My God.

59:22.958 --> 59:24.958
- Mrs. Dar.
- Yes, Mrs. Rina.

59:25.041 --> 59:25.916
Where's Dwi?

59:26.000 --> 59:28.333
She's with your mother.

59:28.416 --> 59:29.375
Mom!

59:31.625 --> 59:33.166
Where is Dwi?

59:33.250 --> 59:34.958
What? Dwi?

59:36.833 --> 59:38.416
- Sweetie?
- Dwi!

59:38.500 --> 59:39.666
- Gosh.
- Dwi!

59:39.750 --> 59:40.833
Sweetie?

59:40.916 --> 59:42.750
- Mrs. Dar, go there.
- Of course.

59:43.541 --> 59:44.666
Sweetie!

59:44.750 --> 59:46.166
Dwi!

59:46.250 --> 59:47.708
Sweetie!

59:48.416 --> 59:49.833
Dwi!

59:49.916 --> 59:51.208
Sweetie!

59:51.291 --> 59:52.375
Dwi!

59:55.291 --> 59:56.375
Dwi!

59:58.791 --> 59:59.875
Dwi!

01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:02.875
Dwi!

01:00:06.041 --> 01:00:07.041
Dwi!

01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:12.708
Dwi?

01:00:18.458 --> 01:00:19.416
Dwi?

01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:31.291
Dwi.

01:00:32.375 --> 01:00:34.041
Please give me the knife.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.625
Just dig the ground with a shovel.
I'll get it later.

01:00:39.708 --> 01:00:41.708
But bring the knife here first, okay?

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:52.541
Dwi!

01:00:58.666 --> 01:00:59.916
Mom.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:00.916
Mom!

01:01:01.625 --> 01:01:03.583
Mom! Are you okay?

01:01:03.666 --> 01:01:04.958
I'm okay.

01:01:05.041 --> 01:01:07.041
Dwi. Dwi is in the room!

01:01:07.125 --> 01:01:08.250
Gosh.

01:01:15.791 --> 01:01:16.916
Dwi.

01:01:19.541 --> 01:01:20.625
Dwi.

01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:29.166
Dwi?

01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:36.875
Dwi.

01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:42.041
Dwi.

01:01:47.208 --> 01:01:48.208
Dwi…

01:02:40.916 --> 01:02:45.833
I can't stand
seeing her like this every day.

01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:50.208
I want her to be like other children.

01:02:50.291 --> 01:02:54.000
You know that I will do anything for her.

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:56.500
So will I, Rin.

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:02.125
Even now,
Mr. Narto and I are still looking

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:05.375
- for the person who--
- Will we ever find that person?

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:07.625
We've checked everyone, Pram.

01:03:08.291 --> 01:03:09.875
My friends.

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:14.916
Mom's friends. My family.
Your coworkers, and yet?

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.583
Nobody did it.

01:03:16.666 --> 01:03:19.666
Until now, we haven't found who did it.

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:25.666
Tomorrow is Dwi's seventh birthday, Pram.

01:03:27.375 --> 01:03:29.833
And according to Mr. Narto,

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:34.041
the old man will come again.

01:03:34.125 --> 01:03:36.666
Rin, I know.

01:03:37.416 --> 01:03:39.416
I know that.

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.333
That's why this afternoon,

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:44.000
Mr. Narto will come with a friend.

01:03:45.416 --> 01:03:48.083
Someone who has stronger powers.

01:03:48.166 --> 01:03:51.583
A father and son from Banyuwangi.

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.125
They will protect our house

01:03:54.208 --> 01:03:59.041
and make sure the old man can't get in,
so that Dwi can't be taken.

01:04:04.250 --> 01:04:05.416
Mr. Yai.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500
Mr. Narto.

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:08.750
Thank you for coming to our house.

01:04:08.833 --> 01:04:10.083
Aryo.

01:04:10.166 --> 01:04:12.583
- We should start soon.
- Yes, please.

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:17.333
Are you ready, Mr. Yai?

01:04:18.750 --> 01:04:21.166
Be careful, remember, and be alert.

01:04:21.250 --> 01:04:22.583
- Yes, Mr. Yai.
- Yes.

01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:27.458
<i>This border is as strong as a fortress</i>
<i>for our defense</i>

01:04:28.333 --> 01:04:31.833
<i>because he will</i>
<i>definitely try hard to get in.</i>

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:35.500
<i>He will come exactly at midnight,</i>

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:38.625
<i>right when Dwi turns seven.</i>

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:44.458
O Allah, the Most Great God.

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:47.875
To You we surrender.

01:04:47.958 --> 01:04:50.791
Give us safety and strength.

01:04:50.875 --> 01:04:53.250
May this protection

01:04:53.958 --> 01:04:58.375
<i>protect Dwi from all forms of disturbance.</i>

01:04:58.458 --> 01:05:01.708
<i>And give us strength</i>

01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:05.125
<i>and our child Dwi Rahasti,</i>
<i>daughter of Pram Prasetyo,</i>

01:05:05.208 --> 01:05:10.000
<i>until all these threats are gone.</i>

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:12.583
If that evil figure comes,

01:05:12.666 --> 01:05:15.250
make him weak.

01:05:15.333 --> 01:05:18.250
Make him go away.

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:20.666
If that evil figure comes,

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.458
make him go away.

01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:25.541
If that evil figure comes,

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:28.083
make him weak.

01:05:28.166 --> 01:05:30.208
If that evil figure comes,

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:32.625
make him weak.

01:05:32.708 --> 01:05:35.625
Make him go away.

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:05.458
- Allah is the Greatest.
- My God!

01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:09.375
- Dwi.
- Dwi!

01:06:09.958 --> 01:06:12.416
He's up there.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.666
Everybody, back off.

01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:15.333
If that evil figure comes,

01:06:15.416 --> 01:06:19.166
make him weak.

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:22.541
Make him go away.

01:06:22.625 --> 01:06:24.000
If that evil figure comes,

01:06:24.083 --> 01:06:26.666
make him weak.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:29.250
Make him go away.

01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:31.250
Leave!

01:06:37.958 --> 01:06:40.125
- Aryo!
- Aryo!

01:06:41.208 --> 01:06:42.500
Mr. Yai!

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:44.541
Everybody, go to the room!

01:06:44.625 --> 01:06:45.958
- Go inside the bedroom!
- Go!

01:06:46.041 --> 01:06:47.708
- Quick!
- Get inside!

01:06:47.791 --> 01:06:49.416
- Ma'am, Mrs. Rina.
- Come.

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.833
- Come in.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:55.250
Narto.

01:06:58.708 --> 01:07:00.250
Narto.

01:07:24.333 --> 01:07:26.125
- Take care of Dwi.
- Yes.

01:07:36.333 --> 01:07:38.500
Pram!

01:07:38.583 --> 01:07:39.958
Pram…

01:07:48.166 --> 01:07:49.875
Dwi. No!

01:07:56.458 --> 01:07:57.791
Hey!

01:07:59.166 --> 01:08:01.250
You ugly creature!

01:08:01.333 --> 01:08:03.083
Who sent you?

01:08:06.333 --> 01:08:07.708
Dwi!

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:09.583
Get out of here!

01:08:11.541 --> 01:08:13.166
Come on, fight me! Come on!

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:14.458
Come on.

01:08:14.541 --> 01:08:16.125
Come on, come here!

01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:18.250
Come on!

01:08:18.333 --> 01:08:20.166
Ugly creature, come on!

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:21.208
Come on!

01:08:22.625 --> 01:08:24.458
Fight me then, come on!

01:08:28.833 --> 01:08:30.625
Cursed creature.

01:08:30.708 --> 01:08:32.791
This is not your place!

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:36.208
Don't bother this family!

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:44.500
Hey, ugly creature!

01:08:44.583 --> 01:08:45.875
Go away.

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:50.833
If that evil figure comes, make him weak.

01:08:50.916 --> 01:08:54.083
You deserve to be tortured in hell!

01:08:54.166 --> 01:08:55.083
Leave!

01:08:57.375 --> 01:08:59.458
Go away!

01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:12.416
Dear. Wake up!

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.958
Pram.

01:09:18.458 --> 01:09:20.333
Are you okay?

01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:26.291
You're safe now.

01:09:59.583 --> 01:10:02.083
<i>For now, you are all safe.</i>

01:10:02.791 --> 01:10:05.625
<i>But I saw it in his eyes.</i>

01:10:06.291 --> 01:10:09.083
Someone here isn't telling the truth.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.458
What do you mean?

01:10:16.333 --> 01:10:19.125
Try to be honest.

01:10:21.125 --> 01:10:24.041
What are you hiding from each other?

01:10:24.125 --> 01:10:25.708
Nothing.

01:10:27.916 --> 01:10:28.750
Pram?

01:10:32.333 --> 01:10:33.875
Actually,

01:10:34.916 --> 01:10:39.416
there's someone I suspect
sent this curse, Rin.

01:10:40.541 --> 01:10:42.791
I just haven't told you yet.

01:10:44.833 --> 01:10:47.000
Ever since we found out that

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:49.000
Yudi had died,

01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:52.291
I thought hard for days.

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:57.458
And I'm pretty sure that
she was the one who sent this curse.

01:10:57.541 --> 01:11:00.750
I told Mr. Narto
and he was also quite confident

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:02.541
that she sent the curse.

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:05.625
Who is it?

01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:08.583
Pram.

01:11:12.375 --> 01:11:13.666
Mawar.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.083
Mawar?

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:19.958
Who's Mawar?

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:25.666
- Have you eaten?
- Yes.

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.833
SOLO, CENTRAL JAVA 1980

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:55.416
So you don't get sleepy.

01:12:07.833 --> 01:12:09.833
Are you sure about Rina?

01:12:10.625 --> 01:12:12.625
Two years of dating,

01:12:12.708 --> 01:12:14.666
but never in the same place.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:18.583
She's always out of town.

01:12:18.666 --> 01:12:20.208
She keeps moving.

01:12:21.041 --> 01:12:24.958
She keeps getting promoted.
There's no way she'll leave her job.

01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:30.250
I don't know.

01:12:30.916 --> 01:12:32.416
You have me, Pram.

01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:39.625
I'll leave everything.

01:12:41.166 --> 01:12:43.333
To be your wife.

01:12:43.416 --> 01:12:45.708
I'll accompany you everywhere,

01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:48.083
so we can always be together.

01:13:14.583 --> 01:13:18.791
So all this time,
I was just a place for you to stop by?

01:13:18.875 --> 01:13:20.833
Please calm down.

01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:23.916
I never thought of you like that.

01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:26.208
But I have to choose.

01:13:35.333 --> 01:13:36.500
Rina said that

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:39.416
she's willing to quit her job for me.

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:46.000
I'm marrying Rina.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:50.541
Pram!

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:57.541
You and your family will be miserable!

01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:14.708
I thought it was just her rage.

01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:17.791
A meaningless threat.

01:14:20.250 --> 01:14:21.166
Rin.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.333
For the past seven years,

01:14:24.416 --> 01:14:28.500
Mr. Narto and I
have kept trying to find Mawar.

01:14:29.916 --> 01:14:33.541
I asked Mr. Narto not to tell you.

01:14:34.791 --> 01:14:37.458
I didn't want to hurt you, Rin.

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:40.916
Rin.

01:14:41.875 --> 01:14:43.625
Please forgive me.

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:48.333
I never met her again, Rin.

01:14:48.416 --> 01:14:50.333
It's only you, Rin. Rina.

01:14:50.416 --> 01:14:52.083
Rin.

01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:55.375
Pram, we don't have much time.
We have to find Mawar.

01:14:55.458 --> 01:14:58.666
- Yes, but how?
- We will perform a ritual.

01:14:58.750 --> 01:15:02.583
I need you and Rina
to participate in this ritual.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:05.708
Rin.

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:18.458
Rin!

01:15:18.541 --> 01:15:20.875
You have every right to be angry, Rin.

01:15:21.666 --> 01:15:24.000
But I'm begging you.

01:15:25.208 --> 01:15:29.541
There are more important things
we have to do now.

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:33.750
We have to save Dwi.

01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:38.541
We have to put an end to this terror, Rin.

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:41.291
I need you.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.458
Dwi needs you, Rin.

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:50.041
I was wrong.

01:15:50.125 --> 01:15:52.458
I know I was wrong.

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:56.916
But please

01:15:57.583 --> 01:15:59.750
let me fix everything.

01:16:03.708 --> 01:16:04.583
Rin.

01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:11.250
So that Dwi

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:14.625
can be like other children.

01:16:23.708 --> 01:16:26.375
Can you promise this will work?

01:16:28.916 --> 01:16:30.250
I promise.

01:16:33.833 --> 01:16:36.666
<i>To His Highness,</i>

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:39.583
<i>the barrier that covered it is now open.</i>

01:16:39.666 --> 01:16:44.875
Give us sight and light on the way.

01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:47.333
Please give us some guidance

01:16:47.416 --> 01:16:50.583
on where the sender is located.

01:16:55.458 --> 01:16:58.458
She is on the border
of Wonosobo and Magelang.

01:16:58.541 --> 01:17:00.458
I know exactly where.

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:10.958
Rin, I'm leaving.

01:17:22.333 --> 01:17:25.791
<i>Rina, Aryo will stay with you at home.</i>

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:30.291
<i>Pram and I are going to Mawar's house.</i>

01:18:00.458 --> 01:18:01.666
Where could it be?

01:18:04.291 --> 01:18:06.166
Let's check out her backyard.

01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:07.333
- Yes.
- Come on.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.166
Pram, dig there.

01:18:27.250 --> 01:18:28.875
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:38.125
- I'll get the shovel in the car.
- Yes.

01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:47.000
You're awake, my love.

01:19:53.458 --> 01:19:56.333
I didn't think you could find me.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.083
Even though my shaman said

01:20:00.166 --> 01:20:03.916
it's unlikely that you'll know.

01:20:10.375 --> 01:20:12.500
Your shaman is not bad.

01:20:15.291 --> 01:20:16.958
But now,

01:20:17.041 --> 01:20:19.625
it's all too late.

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:27.458
You never see me, do you, Pram?

01:20:32.333 --> 01:20:34.541
I was always there for you.

01:20:34.625 --> 01:20:37.041
Not Rina! Me!

01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:53.708
I'm satisfied

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:56.833
seeing you and your wife suffer
for seven years.

01:20:58.708 --> 01:21:03.166
This is a lot more fun
than killing you all one by one.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:10.958
Wait.

01:21:12.291 --> 01:21:13.750
Wait a second.

01:21:13.833 --> 01:21:16.833
No one shall disturb this curse.

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:57.208
Pram.

01:21:57.291 --> 01:21:59.916
Find the jar.

01:22:01.583 --> 01:22:03.416
Yes, I will.

01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:51.958
Mr. Yai.

01:22:54.125 --> 01:22:55.125
Sir.

01:22:55.208 --> 01:22:57.333
Mr. Yai. Sir?

01:22:57.416 --> 01:22:59.708
I've got the jar, sir.

01:22:59.791 --> 01:23:01.750
Mr. Yai. Come on.

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.916
Sir. I have the jar.

01:23:21.625 --> 01:23:22.583
Sir?

01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:28.250
Mr. Yai.

01:23:31.791 --> 01:23:34.708
Indeed, we belong to Allah,
and indeed, to Him we will return.

01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:44.916
Hello?

01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.333
Rin, is Aryo there?

01:23:51.625 --> 01:23:52.791
Hello?

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:54.791
Aryo, your father…

01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:56.791
He passed away.

01:23:56.875 --> 01:23:58.791
Mawar hit his head.

01:23:58.875 --> 01:24:00.375
He bled a lot and…

01:24:00.458 --> 01:24:01.958
He couldn't make it.

01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:10.000
Indeed, we belong to Allah,
and indeed, to Him we will return.

01:24:11.375 --> 01:24:12.666
<i>Aryo.</i>

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:14.458
I have the jar with me.

01:24:14.541 --> 01:24:16.458
What should I do now?

01:24:16.541 --> 01:24:18.875
Mr. Pram, bring it here.

01:24:19.708 --> 01:24:22.458
I'll do the ritual.

01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:29.083
<i>Please forgive us, Aryo.</i>

01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:32.833
<i>Because of all this,</i>

01:24:34.583 --> 01:24:36.375
<i>your father…</i>

01:24:37.791 --> 01:24:39.083
<i>It's okay, Mrs. Rina.</i>

01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:42.416
<i>This was his destiny.</i>

01:24:55.375 --> 01:24:57.291
Have strength, Rin.

01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:59.250
This will be over soon.

01:25:09.458 --> 01:25:10.291
Dwi.

01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:11.875
Aryo?

01:25:13.458 --> 01:25:14.291
Aryo?

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:18.875
Stay in your room. Don't go out.

01:25:19.416 --> 01:25:20.541
- Mom.
- Yes.

01:25:20.625 --> 01:25:22.000
Dwi.

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:28.583
Aryo.

01:25:43.666 --> 01:25:44.916
Aryo!

01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:11.541
Don't you dare hurt this family again!

01:26:17.666 --> 01:26:20.250
- Mom, please take care of Dwi!
- Yes.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.250
Aryo?

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:28.583
Aryo!

01:26:41.333 --> 01:26:42.500
Dwi.

01:26:42.583 --> 01:26:43.708
Dwi!

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:45.958
Mom!

01:26:46.041 --> 01:26:47.208
Mom!

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:50.416
Mom!

01:26:51.208 --> 01:26:52.916
Mom!

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.708
Are you okay, Mom?

01:26:54.791 --> 01:26:57.333
Dwi! Where's Dwi?

01:26:57.416 --> 01:26:59.166
Dwi was taken.

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:05.625
Dwi! Don't take her!

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:10.416
No one else can perform the ritual.

01:27:11.875 --> 01:27:15.166
This child is mine.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:16.750
No!

01:27:16.833 --> 01:27:19.541
My blood has flowed
into this child's blood.

01:27:19.625 --> 01:27:23.625
My saliva has reached your womb.

01:27:25.083 --> 01:27:28.291
You think this is Pram's child?

01:27:34.375 --> 01:27:37.166
She wouldn't even want to be his.

01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:40.083
Let her go!

01:27:43.875 --> 01:27:46.250
No matter who her father is,

01:27:47.291 --> 01:27:49.458
I'm still her mother!

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:54.541
You have no right to take her!

01:27:55.875 --> 01:27:59.125
I will do whatever it takes

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:01.250
as long as Dwi stays alive!

01:28:05.166 --> 01:28:08.250
If you like me,

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.583
just take me!

01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:15.333
Instead of taking her life,

01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:17.166
take mine!

01:28:41.416 --> 01:28:42.583
Dwi.

01:28:45.333 --> 01:28:49.333
I may not be here to raise you.

01:28:51.083 --> 01:28:55.208
But I will always take care of you

01:28:55.291 --> 01:28:58.041
and look after you.

01:29:00.291 --> 01:29:01.666
To me,

01:29:02.708 --> 01:29:05.250
you are my everything.

01:29:22.208 --> 01:29:23.666
Dwi…

01:29:43.625 --> 01:29:48.083
Mommy loves you, Dwi.

01:30:42.541 --> 01:30:45.666
Rina!

01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.500
- Rina!
- Rin!

01:30:47.583 --> 01:30:49.458
- Rin!
- Rina!

01:30:49.541 --> 01:30:51.708
Pram, Rina is missing!

01:30:51.791 --> 01:30:53.333
Rina is missing!

01:30:53.416 --> 01:30:57.625
- Rina!
- My God.

01:30:57.708 --> 01:30:58.875
Dwi.

01:31:00.875 --> 01:31:02.083
Sweetie?

01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:06.541
Rina.

01:31:07.666 --> 01:31:11.250
Sweetie, where's your mother?

01:31:11.958 --> 01:31:14.291
Please tell me.

01:31:16.916 --> 01:31:20.750
Rina!

01:31:28.416 --> 01:31:31.791
Wake up, Rina.

01:31:35.416 --> 01:31:36.458
Rin.

01:31:49.208 --> 01:31:52.250
Wake up, Rin, wake up.

01:31:55.041 --> 01:31:57.583
- Wake up.
- Rin…

01:31:58.875 --> 01:32:00.833
- Rina…
- Rina…

01:32:01.583 --> 01:32:03.666
This is your fault, Pram!

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:04.916
It's all your fault!

01:32:07.416 --> 01:32:09.291
Rina…

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:24.541
Rina…

01:32:24.625 --> 01:32:25.666
Mom.

01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:29.500
I'm leaving Dwi with you.

01:32:29.583 --> 01:32:32.875
Where are you going? Rina is gone.

01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:37.500
Please forgive me, Mom.

01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:42.583
I'm removing the curse.

01:32:43.916 --> 01:32:46.458
I've promised Rina.

01:33:03.583 --> 01:33:05.458
Dwi.

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:10.750
Please forgive your father.

01:33:11.625 --> 01:33:13.541
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

01:34:01.708 --> 01:34:02.916
Mawar?

01:34:20.208 --> 01:34:21.333
Mawar.

01:34:24.666 --> 01:34:25.666
Pram.

01:34:29.791 --> 01:34:32.250
Did you come back here to kill me?

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:37.458
I just want to ask you for help.

01:34:38.458 --> 01:34:40.791
Release the curse from Dwi

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:43.125
and bring Rina back.

01:34:44.166 --> 01:34:46.791
Do you think I was joking

01:34:47.375 --> 01:34:50.416
when I said that you and your family

01:34:50.500 --> 01:34:52.458
will be miserable?

01:34:53.875 --> 01:34:54.875
Mawar.

01:34:57.458 --> 01:34:59.541
You made a mistake coming here, Pram!

01:35:01.416 --> 01:35:02.458
Mawar.

01:36:18.125 --> 01:36:19.375
Pram!

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:34.375
Enough, Mawar!

01:36:34.458 --> 01:36:37.250
Enough! Stop!

01:36:37.333 --> 01:36:39.041
Please listen to me!

01:36:39.125 --> 01:36:41.041
Remove the curse from my family!

01:36:41.125 --> 01:36:42.958
Bring back Dwi and Rina!

01:36:43.625 --> 01:36:46.250
Never.

01:36:57.833 --> 01:37:00.833
Mawar, I can hurt you.

01:37:06.375 --> 01:37:08.541
And I thought you loved me.

01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:14.625
Please, Mawar.

01:37:14.708 --> 01:37:15.541
Enough.

01:37:20.291 --> 01:37:22.125
Please. Enough.

01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:16.166
Enough, Mawar.

01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:17.958
You could die.

01:38:18.041 --> 01:38:19.875
Isn't that what you want?

01:38:19.958 --> 01:38:22.708
So that you and your family
can be free from the curse?

01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:09.500
Please stop this, Mawar.

01:39:09.583 --> 01:39:11.375
It doesn't have to be like this.

01:39:11.458 --> 01:39:14.250
I just want you
to bring Rina and Dwi back.

01:39:17.083 --> 01:39:19.083
You're still choosing Rina?

01:39:20.875 --> 01:39:23.208
If you love her that much,

01:39:23.291 --> 01:39:25.625
then follow her to hell.

01:39:25.708 --> 01:39:28.041
No witchcraft can bring her back.

01:39:28.125 --> 01:39:29.583
She's dead.

01:39:29.666 --> 01:39:31.708
She has become that old man's bride!

01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:56.666
Rina!

01:40:19.708 --> 01:40:21.083
Rin.

01:40:21.166 --> 01:40:24.958
I can't live without you, Rin.

01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:28.875
Forgive me, Rina.

01:40:35.416 --> 01:40:36.750
Mom.

01:40:36.833 --> 01:40:40.333
I hope Dwi will be fine after this.

01:40:55.458 --> 01:40:56.541
Dwi.

01:41:10.666 --> 01:41:11.958
Dwi.

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:14.750
Dwi.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:17.625
Who are you?

01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:19.708
Dwi.

01:41:20.291 --> 01:41:22.500
You can talk?

01:41:23.125 --> 01:41:25.041
Who is Dwi?

01:41:54.333 --> 01:41:58.375
<i>Valedictory speech by Dwi Rahasti,</i>

01:41:58.458 --> 01:42:00.791
graduate of the Medical Program,

01:42:00.875 --> 01:42:05.750
with a GPA of 3.98, cum laude!

01:42:09.166 --> 01:42:10.916
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:42:20.791 --> 01:42:22.625
Thank you, everyone.

01:42:25.083 --> 01:42:26.458
Since I was a little girl,

01:42:26.541 --> 01:42:31.416
I grew up without my parents.

01:42:31.500 --> 01:42:34.958
I don't even have

01:42:35.041 --> 01:42:37.916
any memory of them

01:42:38.666 --> 01:42:41.000
when they were alive.

01:42:43.916 --> 01:42:46.791
However, there is one thing

01:42:46.875 --> 01:42:49.333
that always rings in my heart.

01:42:50.666 --> 01:42:53.833
Their wish is for me

01:42:53.916 --> 01:42:57.166
to be useful to many people.

01:42:58.083 --> 01:42:59.458
Today,

01:42:59.541 --> 01:43:03.583
I dedicate this graduation to them.
