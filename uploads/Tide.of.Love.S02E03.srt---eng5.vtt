WEBVTT

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.730
What happened to Jaehun

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.970
in the past?

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.850
If I don't try and find out

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.340
and just accept what he shows me,

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.160
no matter if he's tender to me
or confining me,

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.120
maybe he and I

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.170
will stay as master and pet

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.680
forever.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:22.970
What I want

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.860
is more than that.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.810
[Kang Soohyung]

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.090
Soohyung.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.210
I'm sorry for calling you out of the blue.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.700
There's something I'd like to ask.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.530
When are you

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.130
free?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289
I want to meet you in person.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.270
You're here?

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.220
Have a seat.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.000
No need.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.810
It's okay.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.979
Speaking of,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.430
Jaehun allows you to go out?

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.250
I sneaked out.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.820
I made this cocktail.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.960
Want to try?

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.890
No.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.340
It's okay. I can't drink.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.060
You're really cute.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.600
How did you meet Jaehun?

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.260
Or...

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.220
are you looking for a new boyfriend?

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.810
Stop joking.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.690
I came because I was worried about him.

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.250
Okay.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.030
Let's get down to business then.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.829
What do you want to know?

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.990
About his past.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.329
Jaehun?

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.620
We've known each other since we were kids.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:35.380
Actually,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.090
he used to be more interesting than now.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.980
He became boring when he grew up.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.170
But

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.820
recently,

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:50.329
I kind of see the old him coming back.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.010
Are you talking about
the domestic violence

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.770
you mentioned previously?

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.970
It was

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.970
terrible.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.540
His father was really violent
towards his mother and him.

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.250
His mother wanted to escape,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:13.840
but she was trapped because of her son.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.230
Kids who grow up domestically abused—

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.120
they grow up to become
one of the extremes.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.650
They either become extremely fearful

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.570
or extremely violent.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.620
In the end,

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.860
they become another abuser.

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.560
It's just like alcohol glasses.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.860
No matter which glass you pour
your drink into, it tastes the same.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.490
Jaehun

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:35.500
is the latter.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.570
He has the same blood
as his father after all.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.210
Subconsciously, he learned that

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.810
only by being immensely strong
can he control violence and fear.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.570
Because he couldn't
fight against his father,

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.050
he moved this desire
onto other things:

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:52.260
his career

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.340
and

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.680
on the bed.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.960
That's also why he's always changing
his bed partner.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.810
He's scared of getting used to something.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.740
He can only gain adrenaline

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.600
through dominating a new person.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.030
That's what he needs.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.680
You're the 10th art student
Secretary Lee hired.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.970
Then...

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.360
everything he did to me was...

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.440
Not everything.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.760
From what I could see,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.290
he treats you differently.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.740
It seems that you really like him.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.630
You're feeling sorry for him?

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.020
But Haejun,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.520
it's dangerous to save someone

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.450
who has a black hole in their heart.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.950
You might be sucked in too.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.640
How about

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.400
having a try with me?

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:17.210
You'll know when you have a comparison.

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.570
I can be way gentler than him.

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:25.390
No, thanks.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.580
Jaehun's probably going to worry about me.

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:29.670
I have to go.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.440
I'm just kidding.

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:34.550
Why are you so nervous?

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.290
Say hello to him for me.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.760
Hello, Ms. Kim.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.690
I've got to the bottom of everything.

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:05.940
He'll break up with Jaehun.

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.670
Just wait.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.220
You're going
to marry Han Jaehun after all.

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:18.210
Han Jaehun.

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.340
What kind of person
will your next lover be?

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:00.020
Where have you been?

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:02.290
I just

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.480
went out for a walk to find inspiration.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:16.830
Is there a need...

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.810
to go to a bar while on a walk?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.240
You're tracking my location?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.090
Since when?

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.880
Did you install something on my phone?

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:39.060
Why?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.110
Can't I?

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.210
I told you from the beginning—

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.680
everything about you belongs to me.

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.760
No matter where you go,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.340
you have to let me know it all.

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:09.610
What are you doing?

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:10.690
My homework.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.100
Ta-da.

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.400
How do you know I like bananas?

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.520
Bananas?

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:22.890
You said

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.350
when you see someone eating a banana,
your heart flutters.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.820
You said that.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.160
You said that.

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.500
I don't remember that.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:35.720
We're a couple.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.590
Shouldn't we trust each other?

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:44.550
It seems that

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:47.460
I've been too nice to you.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:51.620
I thought you already knew.

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:54.630
You still don't understand?

00:08:57.390 --> 00:08:59.120
Why do you think

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.660
you can have your own secrets?

00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:27.330
Are you...

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:30.330
hiding something from me?

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:43.150
Haejun.

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:46.980
Be good.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.690
I've never fallen in love
with anyone like this.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.360
Be good.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:34.310
Haejun, where should I hang this?

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:39.920
Kim Haejun!

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.630
What's going on?

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:40.880
Why did you come up?

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.820
I'm in class.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.840
You've been

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.650
ignoring me lately.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:08.320
No, I'm in class.

00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:38.700
[What's that sound?]
[I heard it too...]
[Oh my, what's...]
[Who is it?]
[What's going on?]
[They must be crazy.]

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.060
Don't look at the screen.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:44.750
Just look at me.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:46.340
Okay?

00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:55.300
Now,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.410
you can only look at me.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:01.050
Got it?

00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:13.980
Not now.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.570
Student Kim Haejun.

00:13:20.410 --> 00:13:21.740
Listen to your teacher.

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.940
Or I'm going to deduct points.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:26.780
I said no!

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.040
You say no, but your body is so honest.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.920
Since it's so honest,

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:49.740
I should reward you.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.120
Should I turn on the camera

00:13:53.470 --> 00:13:55.670
and show everyone what you're like now?

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:00.040
You don't want to?

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.450
Okay.

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.280
Haejun.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.040
What's going on over there?

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.260
Are you okay?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:15.580
I'm fine.

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:18.270
My puppy bit me just now.

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:21.680
Puppy?

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:24.350
When did I become your puppy?

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:42.310
All right.

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:45.220
That's all for today's class.

00:14:45.570 --> 00:14:47.040
That's it.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:00.100
No one will disturb us now.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.190
I shall start my lesson.

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.160
Answer me.

00:15:15.990 --> 00:15:17.650
What you're learning today is

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.960
when I need you,

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.430
you must come immediately,

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:31.390
understand?

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.250
Who must come immediately?

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:36.820
Me.

00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:47.180
Good.

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:13.790
Jaehun.

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.150
Did you see my phone?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.160
Why are you looking for it?

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.590
Why are there so many other people
you care about other than me?

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:27.410
You can find your class schedules
using your laptop.

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:28.540
As for other things,

00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:31.400
I've already taught you in the afternoon.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.660
Use this from now on.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.180
There's no need for you to contact anyone
but me.

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.280
What's the meaning of this?

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.480
I'll be safekeeping your phone.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:04.619
Those unrelated contacts you have

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:06.480
and various information you get—

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.470
they will only affect your focus.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.500
You just need to focus on your study

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.240
and get used to being with me.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:15.990
I'm enough for you.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:20.079
You've gone too far.

00:17:21.819 --> 00:17:23.099
I have my own life.

00:17:25.109 --> 00:17:26.839
I have friends and professors.

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:30.600
You can't interfere
with my life like this.

00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:43.540
Haven't I given you enough?

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.530
What more do you need?

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:48.670
I've given you a house,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.370
a phone,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:51.760
and the room too.
What else do you need?

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:56.990
You just have to

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:59.960
stay by my side.

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:02.940
Do you understand?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:14.660
Who is this?

00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.960
A friend.

00:18:21.850 --> 00:18:23.510
There's someone I don't know?

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:39.320
Haejun.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:48.540
Think about it.

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:53.740
About who you should stay with

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.540
and who you should be with.

00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.410
Hmm?

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:08.560
Reflect.

00:19:09.870 --> 00:19:10.660
Otherwise,

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:14.910
from now on,

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:18.440
you can't leave this room.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.030
Do you understand?

00:19:33.530 --> 00:19:33.990
Jaehun.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:36.730
What are you doing?

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.240
This is illegal!

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.900
Don't you understand?

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.040
You can only stay in this room.

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.010
The outside world is tiring

00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.630
and noisy.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:55.830
It's so nice here.

00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:57.900
It's a comfortable house,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.830
with paintings,

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.630
and chandeliers.

00:20:01.890 --> 00:20:04.410
Don't you want to stay here

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:06.580
and live with me?

00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:09.380
You're being controlling.

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.030
Controlling?

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:32.830
Jaehun, no.

00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:50.340
Kim Haejun.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.780
Have you forgotten who is your master?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.550
Since when is the person controlling you

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:57.990
not me, but someone else?

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.450
You're turning me down?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:07.100
Have you forgotten how we
ended up in a relationship like this?

00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.850
Have you forgotten our first meeting?

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.900
Let me teach you again.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:13.800
It's okay.

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:20.390
Jaehun, no.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.540
This is right.

00:21:46.710 --> 00:21:47.510
That's right.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.200
You are

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:51.890
completely in my hands.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.180
How do you feel?

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:58.690
Still want to look for Soyu?

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:00.810
Are you treating me like a pet?

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:03.920
Pet?

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:09.110
That's a good idea.

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.240
You should act like a pet then.

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:12.730
Right, Haejun?

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.140
This is a warning.

00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:21.210
Stay in your place.

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:54.180
What are you looking at?

00:22:54.410 --> 00:22:54.900
Birds.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.100
It can fly wherever it wants.

00:22:58.010 --> 00:22:59.210
It can leave anytime.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.350
Are you jealous?

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.250
Not all birds can do that.

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.660
Besides,

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:37.800
you are a canary

00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:40.200
I am caging.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.330
I baked this in the morning.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.500
Eat it.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:16.960
Is it good?

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:27.560
Jaehun.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:28.860
Yes?

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:33.080
When did you become like this?

00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:38.580
It wasn't like this at first.

00:24:43.950 --> 00:24:45.210
I was always like this.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.370
I've never changed.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.750
Aren't you too naive?

00:25:00.610 --> 00:25:02.410
You only see what you want to see.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.340
This is the real me.

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.380
I'll be late tonight.

00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.800
There's no food at home.
I need to go grocery shopping.

00:25:50.210 --> 00:25:51.280
You eat so much.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:18.930
Wait for me at home.

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:21.090
Got it?

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.090
My baby.

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:32.560
Be good.

00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:08.460
Where is the key?

00:27:09.270 --> 00:27:10.560
Did he take it?

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.670
People haven't heard from me for two days,
they must be worried.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.070
He went too far this time.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:39.350
Found it!

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.460
I got to find my phone too though.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:23.750
Is this

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:26.560
a photo from his childhood?

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:30.850
It's the same bear.

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.680
Is this his childhood toy too?

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.600
They look exactly the same.

00:28:53.670 --> 00:28:54.670
I told you, right?

00:28:56.620 --> 00:28:58.290
To not to walk around.
