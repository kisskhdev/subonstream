00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.239
Why isn't Zhu Zhu here?

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.780
He messaged me half an hour ago.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.000
Said he was washing up.

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:05.920
Then he should be here soon.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.039
But knowing him...

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.479
If he says he's washing up...

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.080
He definitely just opened his eyes.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.400
Well, half an hour is enough for him...

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.500
To wash up and get ready.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.020
Can't rule out that after opening his eyes...

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.379
He might have fallen back asleep.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.300
If you ask me...

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.340
Let's not bring him next time we go out.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.340
Sounds good to me.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.819
Ruined the game on the first day.

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.259
Affected work on the second day.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.500
Are you still holding a grudge

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.800
Because he killed you yesterday?

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:28.620
Not really.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.159
It's just...

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.560
Let me tell you guys...

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.240
All the evidence clearly proved...

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.360
That I wasn't the spy.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.020
But he acted like he had rabies...

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.000
Bit onto me and wouldn't let go.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.120
And in the end?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.479
He was the spy himself.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.520
Gossiping behind my back, huh?

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.379
Is this the quality...

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:44.860
A contemporary college student should have?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.259
The big spy is up!

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.199
Let me tell you guys.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.520
The biggest plot hole in yesterday's script was...

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.659
How could I possibly be a spy?

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm such an upright person.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.360
Upright.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.659
Such a kind personality.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.039
Kind.

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.759
How could I...

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:59.699
Morning, kids.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.439
Morning, Auntie Cai.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:03.520
What are you chatting about so early?

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.819
Something about rabies and spies.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.219
Auntie Cai.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.879
We were talking about...

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:09.560
The Murder Mystery Game we played last night.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.199
Murder Mystery Game.

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.860
Murder.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:12.599
Murder who?

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.120
Nobody gets murdered.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.740
Murder Mystery Game is just...

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:17.639
A game.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.719
I've played it.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.099
Young people love it.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.860
Boss Li is quite trendy.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:23.879
You bet.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:26.900
Although I've played this game...

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.620
I personally don't think it's very interesting.

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:31.979
It's just a group of people sitting around a table.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.259
Then "Night falls, please close your eyes."

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:35.919
"Day breaks, please open your eyes."

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:36.860
Then just kill.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.400
Then just...

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.560
Um...

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.539
That's not exactly trendy.

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:41.520
That "Night falls, please close your eyes"...

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.780
That's called Werewolf.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.580
It's been out of style for ages.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.099
Anyway, they're both the same.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.300
Just killing each other.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.939
Not interesting.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.199
This Werewolf and Murder Mystery Game...

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.919
There is still a big difference.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.039
Of course...

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.659
Laymen who haven't played wouldn't understand.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.620
You tell me,

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.419
someone who lost three chess games in a row,

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.240
standing here spouting nonsense.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.479
Don't you find that ridiculous?

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.960
Transfer me that fifteen yuan first,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.400
then you can spout nonsense.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.180
Let me ask you,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.680
winning or losing at chess...

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:10.599
what's that got to do with me spouting...

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.539
What?

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.039
What does it have to do with me expressing an opinion?

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.580
But you haven't played either of these.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.579
What right do you have to express an opinion?

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.839
I disdain

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.740
playing such childish tricks.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.079
I save my time for more meaningful things.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.720
So what are these more meaningful things?

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.879
Losing three games of chess in a row?

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.060
You two,

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.199
bickering first thing in the morning?

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:31.779
About this Murder Mystery Game,

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:33.660
I heard about it from my students.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.259
It's a bit like acting.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.699
Everyone gets a role,

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.600
then you analyze the character based on the script.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.420
There's also a host.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.860
Right.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.240
Like a director,

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:46.720
leading the players to advance the plot step by step.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.480
Am I right?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.800
Right.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.339
Acting? Well,

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.079
I'd actually like to try that if there's a chance.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.180
Might actually be interesting.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.660
Then I'll try it with Teacher Liu.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.379
I'll try too.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.860
Your brain will get confused.

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:00.879
Go back and study your chess manuals first.

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.259
I heard this game is more fun with more people.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.459
That's easy.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:07.379
Count me in.

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.060
Then I'll go mobilize Old Liang,

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.980
Rudy,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.680
and the grandparents.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.060
Right.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.360
Let's not rush.

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:15.279
The Murder Mystery Game place we went to, Fusheng Yimeng,

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.160
is quite far from our community.

00:05:17.399 --> 00:05:19.480
And with so many of us asking for leave to go out,

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.560
I don't know if Director Chang will approve it.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.220
Isn't that the truth.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.139
That is quite troublesome.

00:05:26.019 --> 00:05:27.040
I believe,

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.060
as long as the will holds strong,

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.579
difficulties always outnumber solutions...

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:32.620
No, wait.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.399
Solutions outnumber difficulties.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.079
Can't we just invite this Fusheng Yimeng

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.959
to come here?

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:40.120
Come to our community to...

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.720
kill?

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:43.680
I think that works.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.240
In order to enrich

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.800
the leisure lives of all our elders,

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:49.800
this time,

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.560
we have specially invited Fusheng Yimeng...

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.600
We have specially invited Fusheng Yimeng...

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.720
What?

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.319
Murder Mystery Game...

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:56.399
Murder Mystery Game Club's...

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.899
Gold Medal DJ.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.000
Good!

00:06:00.079 --> 00:06:01.319
It's DM.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.139
DM is the host.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.660
A DJ is a sound mixer.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.060
The DM, the host,

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:11.259
has come to our community in person

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.060
to bring all you elders a

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.660
spectacular

00:06:15.399 --> 00:06:15.920
what?

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:16.620
Murder Mystery Game.

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:17.779
Murder Mystery Game.

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.720
Um,

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:20.759
thank you.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.300
Thanks to Director Chang for the invitation.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:24.500
As our shop's gold medal script...

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.939
Wait a minute.

00:06:24.939 --> 00:06:25.279
Play later.

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.660
Wait.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.779
As our shop's gold medal Murder Mystery Game...

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:29.879
uh, host,

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.160
bar none.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.240
It's also my first time doing door-to-door service.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.500
I hope to give all you elders

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:37.920
a profound gaming experience.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.620
Before we start,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:41.379
I need to explain a few things.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:43.040
As the host,

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.459
it's not just about hosting.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.420
He also needs to introduce the story background,

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:50.399
guide the flow of the game,

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.939
and distribute some

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:54.259
props,

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.600
act as referee,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.519
and guide new players.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:58.500
Don't worry, child.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.360
Even though I didn't understand what you said,

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:01.300
however,

00:07:01.519 --> 00:07:02.879
us grandpas and grandmas

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:04.339
will definitely cooperate with you.

00:07:04.339 --> 00:07:06.360
We'll do whatever you say, right?

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:07.939
Okay.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.620
Thank you.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:09.560
So, Director Chang,

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.639
could you take them

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:11.939
downstairs to rest a bit?

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:12.800
I'll guide them through the game.

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.259
We can't stay?

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:14.420
Stay?

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:14.839
Right.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.680
Because Murder Mystery Game

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.420
is a very private game.

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:19.959
Okay.

00:07:19.959 --> 00:07:21.720
Have fun, everyone.

00:07:21.939 --> 00:07:22.899
Call us if you need anything.

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:24.259
See you at dinner.

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:25.160
Have a good time, Auntie.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.680
Look at all these words.

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:30.939
How long will it take to read all this?

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.480
I've gotten dizzy seeing words since I was little.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.980
I have no problem reading.

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:37.459
But no one reminded me to wear reading glasses.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.379
Why don't you try mine?

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:41.779
Wait, your prescriptions don't match.

00:07:41.779 --> 00:07:42.800
I mean, you're nearsighted.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:43.519
Why are you wearing reading glasses?

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.379
I... well...

00:07:44.459 --> 00:07:45.920
Uncles and Aunties, don't rush.

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:46.560
Let's...

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.860
take a look now at...

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.379
the characters in this game.

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:50.360
Your own characters.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:51.959
Wait.

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:52.939
I have a question.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:53.420
Ask.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.279
Why on earth...

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.620
do I have to play a poor scholar?

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.199
This doesn't match my personality...

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:02.279
or my professional status at all.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.839
It's like this, Uncle.

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:05.180
In this game of ours...

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.540
the roles are assigned randomly.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.759
If you're not satisfied with the role...

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.480
you can discuss with other players...

00:08:11.579 --> 00:08:12.100
and swap.

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.319
It's allowed. You can swap.

00:08:13.319 --> 00:08:14.040
We can swap.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.660
My identity is a pawnshop owner.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.680
How about we swap?

00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:18.199
Sure.

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:19.019
Let's just swap.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.339
That's more like it.

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:22.180
Look at your shabby appearance.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.060
You're more suited to play a rich local boss.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:24.959
No, wait.

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:25.980
Mine isn't quite right either.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.560
Go ahead.

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:29.060
With my image and temperament...

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.779
how can I play a waiter?

00:08:31.819 --> 00:08:34.039
A waiter fits you. I need to swap too.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.559
How can I play a woman from a Pleasure House?

00:08:36.759 --> 00:08:38.159
I am usually such a...

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:40.139
virtuous and quiet woman.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:43.379
No, we are acting here.

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:43.960
Right.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.179
Whatever character you play...

00:08:45.179 --> 00:08:47.399
has nothing to do with your actual personality.

00:08:47.399 --> 00:08:48.259
Right.

00:08:48.259 --> 00:08:49.519
Can someone tell me...

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.259
what this "constable"...

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.740
is supposed to be?

00:08:53.019 --> 00:08:53.620
Does it mean...

00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:54.860
I run very fast?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.500
That is just an ancient...

00:08:57.559 --> 00:08:58.879
policeman who catches people.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.220
How do I explain this to you...

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.360
Next...

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:03.940
please introduce yourselves one by one.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.220
I'll go first.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.580
I am...

00:09:10.259 --> 00:09:11.480
a poor scholar.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.179
I passed through here three days ago.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:15.340
I'm staying at the inn.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.419
I met the Pleasure House Top Courtesan once.

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.340
No grudges, no hatred.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.139
I definitely have no reason to kill her.

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:23.419
My turn.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.379
I am the Pleasure House Brothel Servant.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:31.980
Still a poor man inside the game.

00:09:32.799 --> 00:09:33.539
As for me...

00:09:33.659 --> 00:09:35.039
I have a crush on the Top Courtesan.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.519
But...

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:39.000
I know my place.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.539
Being able to steal a glance at her...

00:09:41.639 --> 00:09:43.480
is enough to satisfy me.

00:09:44.899 --> 00:09:47.159
So I can't be the killer.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.320
Me.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.299
Pawnshop owner.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.379
Rich and powerful.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.100
I am the Top Courtesan's Patron.

00:09:58.340 --> 00:09:59.779
I've been wanting to redeem her.

00:10:00.139 --> 00:10:01.320
How could I possibly kill her?

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:03.740
Let me state my position first.

00:10:04.519 --> 00:10:05.840
Regarding this murderer...

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:07.539
I think...

00:10:07.879 --> 00:10:09.159
we must investigate thoroughly.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:09.919
Makes sense.

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:16.820
I am the Pleasure House Top Courtesan.

00:10:21.019 --> 00:10:22.080
As soon as I start,

00:10:22.419 --> 00:10:23.440
I get killed.

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.960
I got killed as soon as I started.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.100
But if I'm killed,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.500
how can I play the rest if I'm dead?

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.340
No, please don't rush, don't rush.

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.299
I can't play this anymore.

00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:31.019
Please put this on first.

00:10:31.019 --> 00:10:31.399
Put it on properly.

00:10:31.559 --> 00:10:32.700
No, I... I can't play anymore.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.440
It works like this.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.679
This process of ours,

00:10:34.679 --> 00:10:35.879
is basically all memories

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:37.480
of what happened before you were killed.

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:39.000
Right.

00:10:39.059 --> 00:10:40.399
So the participation level is still very high.

00:10:40.419 --> 00:10:41.919
Then I understand, this is just...

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.600
a flashback.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.440
Right, a flashback, is it?

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:43.919
Flashback.

00:10:43.919 --> 00:10:45.320
That's alright then.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.340
My turn, right?

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:46.779
Yes.

00:10:49.279 --> 00:10:50.559
As the Magistrate,

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:52.899
this official believes

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.379
the biggest suspect in this case

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.200
is either Old Fan or Old Li.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.059
Silence!

00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:02.000
The case is obvious.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.379
The two of them,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.740
one of them,

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.179
Right.

00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:08.340
Top Courtesan Liu,

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.100
had a secret crush that went nowhere,

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:14.960
turning love into hate,

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.820
leading to a ruthless murder.

00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:21.019
As the saying goes,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.840
if I can't have her,

00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:23.860
no one else can either.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.039
Sir,

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.440
we are currently in the self-introduction phase.

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:29.779
It doesn't require deduction,

00:11:29.779 --> 00:11:30.740
nor does it require debate.

00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:32.139
That's right.

00:11:32.539 --> 00:11:33.620
You simply...

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:34.279
don't understand

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.720
what kind of person I actually am.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:37.519
Then what kind of person are you?

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:38.980
On the surface,

00:11:39.399 --> 00:11:41.019
I am a scholar taking the exams.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.019
Actually, I have a side job

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:44.539
as a fortune teller.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.200
Just the day before

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:48.720
the Top Courtesan was killed,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.799
she came to me for a reading.

00:11:51.139 --> 00:11:51.899
And,

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.620
she told me a lot.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.440
An important secret

00:11:56.539 --> 00:11:57.259
What secret?

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:00.720
The script says

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:02.539
I can't tell you right now

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:04.519
Then you're still a suspect

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.360
I agree

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.059
He doesn't look like any good

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:09.899
How could I be a suspect?

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:10.399
Look

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.899
This official sees all

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.120
And is strictly impartial

00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:16.860
Seeing you hem and haw

00:12:17.139 --> 00:12:18.039
You must be hiding something

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.539
I protest

00:12:20.419 --> 00:12:21.480
We scholars

00:12:21.759 --> 00:12:22.840
Keep our word

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.580
Since I promised secrecy

00:12:24.779 --> 00:12:26.159
I must do as I say

00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:28.259
How can you based on this

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.360
To list me as

00:12:29.419 --> 00:12:30.360
A suspect?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:32.200
What kind of scholar?

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.580
You said yourself you're a fortune teller

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.200
Fortune tellers are "The lowest of the low"

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.519
Just like those selling fake medicine

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:39.139
And miracle pills on the street

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:40.940
We live together, I know you

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:43.679
This is a character in the game

00:12:43.759 --> 00:12:45.600
Can you stop the personal attacks?

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:46.279
Besides

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:47.740
Teacher Liu

00:12:47.779 --> 00:12:49.120
Is a woman of the Pleasure House

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.559
Liu

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:52.240
Teacher Liu must have been forced by gangs

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.159
Into prostitution against her will

00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:54.539
Or paying off debts

00:12:54.539 --> 00:12:55.480
Or selling herself to bury her father

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.120
Look at what you're saying

00:12:57.179 --> 00:12:59.240
Would our Sister Liu do that?

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:00.139
No

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.559
That's the character

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:03.259
Not me, I'm not

00:13:03.259 --> 00:13:04.899
But they're making it sound confusing

00:13:04.899 --> 00:13:05.600
You know?

00:13:06.259 --> 00:13:07.039
No, come on

00:13:07.039 --> 00:13:08.240
Everyone

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.779
Everyone, calm down

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:10.539
Let me explain

00:13:11.019 --> 00:13:12.340
We are currently in

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.039
The self-introduction phase

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:15.379
Not the deduction phase yet

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:17.100
Nor the case analysis

00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:18.580
That's right

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.259
I haven't spoken yet

00:13:20.559 --> 00:13:21.159
I am

00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.039
Run Fast

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.120
Leader

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.720
It's Mr. Liang

00:13:25.159 --> 00:13:26.759
It's the County Big Uncle

00:13:26.759 --> 00:13:27.779
What Big Uncle?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.820
Why not Second Uncle?

00:13:29.159 --> 00:13:30.259
That character is pronounced "Tai"

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:32.100
There's a dot under the "Big" character

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.000
Taiye

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.259
What does that mean?

00:13:35.259 --> 00:13:35.759
It means

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.120
Is he bigger than a Big Uncle?

00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:38.019
No

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.919
That is an official title

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.600
It's like a County Magistrate

00:13:41.659 --> 00:13:42.100
Right

00:13:42.419 --> 00:13:43.100
Understood

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.139
Before the Top Courtesan was killed

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.080
I was at the County Big Uncle's

00:13:48.539 --> 00:13:49.299
Taiye

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:50.460
Desk

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.639
I saw a... Shu-zi

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:53.379
What?

00:13:53.379 --> 00:13:54.179
What? A rat?

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.659
A mouse, right?

00:13:55.659 --> 00:13:56.440
Let me see

00:13:56.559 --> 00:13:57.740
You can't look at other people's scripts

00:14:00.039 --> 00:14:01.360
That is a bracelet

00:14:01.779 --> 00:14:02.419
Bracelet

00:14:02.419 --> 00:14:03.539
What comb?

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:05.980
Bracelet, understand?

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:06.940
No

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:07.879
You mean

00:14:09.059 --> 00:14:11.539
A bracelet placed on top of a bracelet?

00:14:13.059 --> 00:14:14.320
I mean

00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:16.679
He means that your

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.419
A table was placed on the bracelet

00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:19.259
No

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:20.059
Yes

00:14:20.059 --> 00:14:21.659
A comb was placed on the table

00:14:22.379 --> 00:14:23.080
I'm confused too

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.519
Enough

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:24.600
Stop playing

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.860
Why stop us from playing all of a sudden?

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.600
I am the Magistrate

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.179
My subordinate is incompetent

00:14:30.179 --> 00:14:31.139
So I fired him, what of it?

00:14:31.639 --> 00:14:33.620
Stripped of his rank to become a commoner

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.480
That was my intention too

00:14:36.899 --> 00:14:37.860
You guys play

00:14:38.299 --> 00:14:39.080
I'll just

00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:41.279
Retire after a job well done

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.419
I'm really not playing anymore

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:45.679
Everyone

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.159
Everyone

00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.059
Wait

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:49.379
Rudy just said

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.360
There's a comb on the Magistrate's table

00:14:52.779 --> 00:14:54.559
No, a bracelet

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.659
Whose bracelet?

00:14:56.899 --> 00:14:58.899
It says here it's the Top Courtesan's bracelet

00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:01.419
Then you are a suspect too

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.759
It's very likely because you coveted Teacher Liu

00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:05.980
No, I mean

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:07.539
The Top Courtesan's beauty

00:15:08.299 --> 00:15:10.320
And fearing exposure afterwards

00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:13.000
You killed her to silence her and prevent future trouble

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.860
Listen to him

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.080
That's actually possible

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.240
He admitted it

00:15:20.159 --> 00:15:20.919
Is that it?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.279
Case solved, game over

00:15:23.279 --> 00:15:24.960
Don't, I haven't played yet

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.100
Don't end it

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.799
Don't you still have that flashback?

00:15:27.799 --> 00:15:28.559
Right

00:15:29.399 --> 00:15:30.500
Come on

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:31.759
Uncles and Aunties

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:33.120
I was wrong

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.720
I was wrong, okay?

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.419
This time I came, I

00:15:36.799 --> 00:15:38.440
I was indeed too optimistic

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.960
I underestimated everyone's

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.539
Sixty years of skill

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:42.879
No, what do you mean?

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:43.840
Are you mocking

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.120
That we don't know how to play?

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.980
Why wouldn't we know?

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.940
Clearly our IQ is too high

00:15:48.940 --> 00:15:50.320
We solved the case in advance

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.159
The script is too childish

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:54.039
Not enough for us to analyze. Right

00:15:54.039 --> 00:15:55.799
It's just illogical

00:15:55.799 --> 00:15:56.139
Right

00:15:56.139 --> 00:15:57.360
I didn't even get to play

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.779
You didn't even get your flashback

00:15:58.779 --> 00:16:00.440
What is wrong with you?

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.980
I know everything you're saying

00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:04.059
When I came

00:16:04.059 --> 00:16:05.779
I was fully mentally prepared

00:16:05.779 --> 00:16:06.220
Yes

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.039
I thought taking the elderly to play a script

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:09.379
Would just be a bit more trouble

00:16:09.659 --> 00:16:11.279
But I didn't expect it to be catastrophic

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.360
Calm down

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.700
I think

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.159
It's because we chose the wrong script

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.320
I thought since they are elderly

00:16:18.379 --> 00:16:20.259
I'd choose an old-style script for them

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.340
According to you, we should have chosen a modern one

00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:23.659
Stronger immersion

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.480
At least we wouldn't have a Magistrate

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.639
Judging a muddled case

00:16:26.700 --> 00:16:28.659
And admitting he's the murderer at the end

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.679
Exactly

00:16:30.639 --> 00:16:31.019
Fine

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:32.679
I admit defeat today

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:33.759
Tomorrow

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:35.659
Tomorrow I'll definitely win it back

00:16:36.059 --> 00:16:36.820
Just you wait

00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.360
He's furious

00:16:42.779 --> 00:16:44.700
Definitely left a psychological scar

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.820
I'm confident this time.

00:16:50.919 --> 00:16:52.259
It'll definitely work.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.580
I studied all the scripts all night.

00:16:56.539 --> 00:16:57.659
And this script right here...

00:16:58.779 --> 00:17:00.620
whether in terms of content,

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:02.320
theme, player count,

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.179
difficulty level,

00:17:03.179 --> 00:17:04.039
or any other aspect,

00:17:04.079 --> 00:17:06.039
is perfect for these seniors.

00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:07.680
Plus, yesterday I specifically

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.099
for that foreign gentleman,

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.700
prepared an English script.

00:17:11.339 --> 00:17:12.500
Too bad he didn't come today.

00:17:14.059 --> 00:17:15.119
Good work, brother.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.140
Time to redeem ourselves.

00:17:18.839 --> 00:17:20.319
Alright, esteemed elders...

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:21.819
No, seniors.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:24.740
Now let's take turns doing

00:17:24.799 --> 00:17:25.640
self-introductions.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.359
Before we introduce ourselves,

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.740
I must emphasize something.

00:17:29.119 --> 00:17:30.480
During the introductions:

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.640
no communicating,

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.680
no debating,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.619
and no dialogue.

00:17:33.799 --> 00:17:34.359
Is that clear?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.079
We must strictly follow the rules.

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.599
Just like yesterday.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:39.480
Right.

00:17:39.539 --> 00:17:39.960
Okay.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.960
So let's start with...

00:17:42.039 --> 00:17:42.759
I'll go first.

00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:43.220
Sure.

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:46.500
First point.

00:17:47.819 --> 00:17:48.880
This script today

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.900
is much better than yesterday's.

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:55.000
In my personal opinion,

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.380
this script is very true to life.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.539
It's grounded and realistic.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.619
Compared to yesterday's...

00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:03.079
what was that garbage?

00:18:03.799 --> 00:18:05.599
We're doing introductions, sir.

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:07.039
Look, aren't I just

00:18:07.039 --> 00:18:08.319
acknowledging your hard work?

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:08.839
Yes.

00:18:09.119 --> 00:18:10.660
Don't get cocky just because you did well.

00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:11.339
Right.

00:18:12.059 --> 00:18:13.319
Now, allow me to introduce

00:18:13.319 --> 00:18:14.740
my own... Okay.

00:18:15.799 --> 00:18:17.039
I am a retired factory director.

00:18:18.099 --> 00:18:19.119
A large state-owned factory.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.619
I'm also the head of this household.

00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:24.500
You could say this home

00:18:24.579 --> 00:18:26.680
was built by me, brick by brick.

00:18:27.059 --> 00:18:29.380
From abject poverty 40 years ago,

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:30.359
with nothing to my name,

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.059
to a four-bedroom home, three generations under one roof.

00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:34.819
It's all due to my lifetime of hard work.

00:18:34.819 --> 00:18:36.599
Did the host write this script last night

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:38.000
based on Grandpa Li?

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:38.859
Seems like it.

00:18:38.859 --> 00:18:40.160
I am also this family's

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.119
one and only absolute authority.

00:18:43.299 --> 00:18:44.539
My understanding is...

00:18:44.539 --> 00:18:45.220
Next person.

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:46.519
You're cutting me off?

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.380
So it's my turn, right?

00:18:53.579 --> 00:18:54.420
As for me,

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.559
I'm married to Old Li.

00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:59.599
And I'm the mother of the children in this family.

00:18:59.759 --> 00:19:00.539
This script is good.

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:01.420
The character setup...

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.079
...is great.

00:19:02.079 --> 00:19:03.680
It's required by the plot.

00:19:04.599 --> 00:19:05.759
Let me continue.

00:19:06.339 --> 00:19:07.839
In this family,

00:19:08.059 --> 00:19:09.079
the eldest son...

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.099
...is a thorn in my side.

00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:14.240
Because he's not my biological son.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.559
He is Old Li's...

00:19:15.779 --> 00:19:17.339
...son with his ex-wife.

00:19:17.619 --> 00:19:18.220
Now,

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:20.519
we're at the critical moment of the demolition split.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:22.160
So naturally, I don't want...

00:19:22.259 --> 00:19:23.960
...to give him more of the family assets.

00:19:24.099 --> 00:19:24.619
Right?

00:19:24.619 --> 00:19:25.279
Me?

00:19:25.359 --> 00:19:27.019
I'm the eldest son of this family.

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.880
Why do I have to be the son?

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.700
Plot requirement.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.200
Fine, I'm the son.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:32.940
I am the son.

00:19:34.119 --> 00:19:35.220
Here's my situation.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.339
My mom passed away early.

00:19:37.619 --> 00:19:39.960
My dad remarried within two years.

00:19:40.319 --> 00:19:41.640
Ever since then,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.319
I've been resentful and held a grudge against them.

00:19:44.539 --> 00:19:45.859
But I was young back then.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.160
I couldn't do anything.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.400
I could only endure it for the time being.

00:19:49.319 --> 00:19:50.480
Grow up and gain skills.

00:19:50.839 --> 00:19:52.940
Waiting for the day the time is right...

00:19:53.319 --> 00:19:54.299
...to avenge my...

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:55.299
...wrongfully dead...

00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:57.000
...biological mother in the netherworld...

00:19:57.059 --> 00:19:58.099
...and take my revenge.

00:19:58.259 --> 00:19:59.039
Let me interject.

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.880
Your biological mother died of illness.

00:20:02.259 --> 00:20:03.880
There was no injustice.

00:20:04.299 --> 00:20:05.460
It wasn't the two of them...

00:20:05.619 --> 00:20:06.839
...conspiring to poison her.

00:20:07.099 --> 00:20:08.799
"Dalang, it's time for your medicine."

00:20:09.359 --> 00:20:10.940
That's just what you think.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:12.799
Is it my turn?

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:13.259
Yes.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.140
I am the daughter of this family.

00:20:17.559 --> 00:20:18.660
Young and beautiful.

00:20:18.799 --> 00:20:20.240
And I'm biological.

00:20:22.259 --> 00:20:23.759
I'm lively and cheerful.

00:20:23.799 --> 00:20:24.980
Loved by everyone.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.579
But I have troubles too.

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:31.079
That is the unreliable husband I married.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.319
I want to divorce him,

00:20:32.319 --> 00:20:33.579
but I don't dare say it.

00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:36.019
I'm afraid he'll get angry and abuse me.

00:20:37.579 --> 00:20:39.259
I am this husband.

00:20:40.359 --> 00:20:41.460
Just my rotten luck.

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:44.700
I am a live-in son-in-law.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.180
My family was poor when I was young.

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:48.500
I dropped out before finishing elementary school.

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:49.460
To survive,

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.940
I've done all kinds of jobs.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:52.279
I've suffered all kinds of hardships.

00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:54.519
Couldn't even get enough to eat.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:55.880
But I love the arts.

00:20:57.119 --> 00:20:58.980
Relying on a few decadent tunes...

00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:00.759
...I won over the factory director's daughter.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:01.660
Who?

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.180
It's me.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:06.140
The reason I became a live-in son-in-law...

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:08.619
...was to enjoy a comfortable life.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:09.880
Who would have thought...

00:21:10.119 --> 00:21:11.619
...all these years, this old man...

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.460
...has guarded against me like a thief.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.640
I must get a huge sum...

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.000
...from this demolition compensation.

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:18.819
I also plan to...

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:19.640
...while he's not looking... Okay.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:20.500
Okay.

00:21:20.539 --> 00:21:22.700
Self-introductions are over, okay?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:24.279
If it's over, it's over.

00:21:24.279 --> 00:21:25.380
What are you getting excited for?

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.980
Success doesn't come easily.

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:28.380
Plot introduction.

00:21:28.779 --> 00:21:29.140
Okay.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.920
Next, everyone listen to me carefully.

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:33.299
One day,

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:35.579
a major event happened in this family.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:37.799
The eldest son went missing.

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:39.920
The property deed also disappeared.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:40.900
Okay.

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.619
Now,

00:21:41.759 --> 00:21:43.859
characters other than the eldest son...

00:21:43.859 --> 00:21:45.940
...start reasoning and debating.

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:46.859
Start.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.299
About this matter

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.799
I have the most say

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:52.400
Take my family for example

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.259
Your family?

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.779
Yeah, my real family

00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:56.819
Something just like this happened

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.180
It was exactly the same

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.640
That year

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.319
My old house

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:03.319
Rumor had it

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.900
It was going to be demolished, whoa

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.640
The family exploded immediately

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.400
That good-for-nothing son of mine

00:22:08.619 --> 00:22:09.980
He has no backbone

00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.339
By that vixen wife of his

00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.420
Who confused him with her pillow talk

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.180
He came running over to me eagerly

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.420
Asking me to transfer the house

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:20.859
To his wife's name

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:22.660
Could I agree to that?

00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:23.940
No way

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:24.880
My foot!

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.079
Grandma

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.160
Can we please

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.779
Stop talking about things unrelated to the plot

00:22:28.779 --> 00:22:30.440
And unrelated to the characters

00:22:30.779 --> 00:22:31.579
Exactly

00:22:31.579 --> 00:22:32.619
Besides, your family matter

00:22:32.619 --> 00:22:33.960
Has nothing to do with the plot

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.720
That's right

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.319
My family's situation

00:22:36.319 --> 00:22:38.039
Is exactly the same as this plot

00:22:38.359 --> 00:22:39.180
Just that day

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.279
When the staff came to inspect the house

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.579
We couldn't find our property deed anywhere

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.039
I sharply realized

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:49.200
It must be that wretched wife of mine

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:49.980
No, wait

00:22:50.099 --> 00:22:51.200
Wretched ex-wife

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:52.940
Bai Jingjing's mom

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.759
Who stole it

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.339
Grandpa

00:22:55.339 --> 00:22:57.079
Can we discuss the plot?

00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:58.079
The plot

00:22:58.259 --> 00:23:00.059
What are you all talking about?

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.539
You shouldn't think the worst of people

00:23:02.579 --> 00:23:04.059
Right? Come on

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.380
Take my family for instance

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.039
We also lost a property deed once

00:23:07.279 --> 00:23:08.160
In the beginning

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.240
My daughter and son-in-law

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.660
Suspected everyone

00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.279
In the end

00:23:11.319 --> 00:23:12.900
Wasn't it found in the gap of the wardrobe

00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.700
After all?

00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:15.559
So I say

00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:18.619
You can't always think the worst of things

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.160
If you put it that way

00:23:20.220 --> 00:23:21.839
I cannot agree with your view

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:24.000
The Eldest Son cannot speak right now

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.059
You are the Eldest Son

00:23:25.059 --> 00:23:26.259
I am not some "Eldest Son" right now

00:23:26.259 --> 00:23:27.599
I am myself, okay?

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.279
Um

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.119
Old Li

00:23:30.119 --> 00:23:32.519
You are typically pampered

00:23:32.619 --> 00:23:33.380
You're used to it

00:23:33.819 --> 00:23:35.160
You don't understand the suffering of the people

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:36.859
When I was young

00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:38.799
It was when our unit was allocating housing

00:23:39.019 --> 00:23:40.799
You have no idea what my colleagues

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:42.559
Just to get a housing quota

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:44.619
What dirty tricks wouldn't they use

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.599
So-called intellectuals and scholars

00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:54.160
Why has this turned into a grievance session again?

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:55.259
No, it seems

00:23:55.259 --> 00:23:57.099
This overly realistic theme

00:23:57.099 --> 00:23:58.259
Is also a hassle

00:23:58.359 --> 00:23:59.660
Just the choice of this script

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.599
I feel is not quite appropriate

00:24:01.599 --> 00:24:03.140
I think this script is quite appropriate

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:04.619
It's close to real life

00:24:05.180 --> 00:24:06.079
Look at us common folks

00:24:06.079 --> 00:24:07.579
We all have something to say about it

00:24:07.579 --> 00:24:08.960
No, look at someone like you

00:24:09.619 --> 00:24:11.079
Brother, don't go

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:20.819
Okay.

00:24:21.099 --> 00:24:21.619
Bye.

00:24:23.940 --> 00:24:24.660
Captain Yusheng.

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:25.220
What's wrong?

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:27.500
Boss Li and Professor Fan

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:28.500
aren't in their rooms.

00:24:29.039 --> 00:24:29.799
Are you sure?

00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.900
Could they be asleep and didn't hear?

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:34.640
I knocked so loud Grandma Jin next door came out.

00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:36.960
I find it strange, too.

00:24:37.039 --> 00:24:38.119
We can't find

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:39.559
Teacher Liu and Auntie Cai anywhere.

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.920
Guess what?

00:24:42.059 --> 00:24:44.039
We can't find Grandpa Liang anywhere.

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:45.839
How did you know?

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.180
The seniors are all missing.

00:24:49.839 --> 00:24:51.299
Why are you all here?

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.299
Didn't you go with the elders?

00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:54.319
Go where?

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.680
They all asked for leave to go to

00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.200
that place...

00:25:01.019 --> 00:25:01.900
Fusheng Yimeng

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.160
to play a Murder Mystery Game.

00:25:04.019 --> 00:25:04.819
Darn it.

00:25:05.339 --> 00:25:07.200
Fusheng Yimeng is done for.
