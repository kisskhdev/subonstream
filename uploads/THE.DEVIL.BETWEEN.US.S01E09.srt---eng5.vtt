00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.720
Excuse me,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.960
is this whole area

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the housing complex
for the old paper mill?

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.500
This whole area is.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.460
That area isn't.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.240
Wasn't there a big case here a while ago?

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.490
Guns were involved, right?

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.340
Are you a reporter?

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.450
I'm an online reporter.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.370
I get it.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.370
You've come to the right person.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.240
I'm a key figure.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:45.870
Come here.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.000
Have a seat.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.460
Come.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.140
Let me tell you all about it.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.590
At the time,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.560
I bought the police half an hour.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.300
Otherwise, they wouldn't
have solved the case so smoothly.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.200
What's wrong?

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.120
Um...

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.900
Do you know Director Yao
from the City Bureau?

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:19.430
No, I don't.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.910
If I knew him, I'd have transferred
out of here long ago.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.000
That's strange.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.910
Captain Li just called me.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.620
He said Director Yao
wants you to go see him in the city.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.680
Did he say what it's about?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.210
No.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.980
Could it be about Quan's case?

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.750
You did a good job

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.610
and caught the City Bureau's eye.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.750
Really? That would be great.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.190
Really?

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.320
That would be great.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.240
Don't get your hopes up.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.490
If it were about a transfer,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:44.220
Li would have told me directly.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.890
Who do you think you are

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.590
to have Director Yao
talk to you personally?

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:49.280
Yeah.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.590
Be mentally prepared.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.450
There might be strings attached.

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:54.590
Strings attached, fine.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.240
Anyway,

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.280
as long as my son can
go to middle school in the city,

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.540
I'm okay with a pay cut.

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.130
You're really set on this?

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.650
Yes.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.000
Go back.

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.140
Is that it?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.630
This is small to you?

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.150
So this shop

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.030
used to be a drug den.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.459
Now that the shop is gone,

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.630
will those addicts
who can't find their fix

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.000
come around here and cause trouble?

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.120
Well,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.630
I haven't heard about that.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.030
That means there are still some people

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.680
who haven't got the news

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.230
and will keep coming to look for drugs.

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.800
Buddy.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.840
What's up?

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.120
Here to buy candy?

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.380
This place got busted.

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.850
Do you want some?

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:53.730
I have a source.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.480
No, no.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:56.310
Come on, have some.

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.780
No.

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.410

What are you doing?

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.680
Why do you run when you see me?

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.680
You were chasing me. Of course I ran.

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.160
Do you even know who I am?

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:12.960
You're...

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.680
a cop?

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.000
Or a debt collector?

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:16.970
Look closely.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.210
See who I am.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.140
Look.

Just for 1,000 yuan,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:36.370
you were chasing me desperately.

You took my money,

00:07:45.659 --> 00:07:47.440
but haven't taken me to the guy yet.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.320
What guy?

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:50.760
The...

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.760
guy selling that stuff.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.710
Didn't you hear what I told the cops?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.000
I saw you were clueless,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.040
so I tricked you.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.710
How would I know
people who sell that stuff?

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.390
Look, dude.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.240
I...

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.830
I'll give you back the money.

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:05.360
Okay?

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.650
I don't want the money.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.190
I want to find the person.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.390
I don't know them.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.300
Then why did you
go to the bubble tea shop?

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:20.360
I...

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.310
I was just passing the bubble tea shop.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:23.370
Isn't that normal?

I'll take you there tonight.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.270
Don't worry.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.510
Bao's got everything you need.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:58.550
You'll be satisfied.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.310
Ever since that Quan died,

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.670
many people are out of supply

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.270
and have all come to Bao now.

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.840
But Bao has been very busy.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:05.550
I don't introduce just anyone.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.450
Who's Quan?

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:10.040
You don't know Quan?

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.240
But you found the bubble tea shop.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.440
You know,

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.010

The gunfight at the old paper mill dorms.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:19.680
The guy who died was Quan.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.910
I saw the news.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.170
I don't know his name.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.790
Ken,

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.510
can you tell me

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:29.080
what exactly you need?

00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:30.000
How much?

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:31.720
I'll give Bao a heads-up.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.920
So he can get it ready.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:34.790
I'm not buying.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:38.630
Selling?

00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:44.890
You're crazy.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:46.780
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.180
Put that away.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:53.150
You're out of your mind.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.910
I can't take you to see Bao.

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.150
You'll get me killed.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:57.240
Let go!

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.270

But the Rat can eat the Elephant.

I'm Hu Wenjing from
the Criminal Investigation Brigade

Have a seat.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.470
I asked you here

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:43.310
to talk about your transfer.

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:46.670
Your resume is excellent.

Regarding

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:48.790

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.400
Why beat around the bush?

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.220
Why did you really bring me here?

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:20.930
I read Jin Longzheng's report,

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:22.880
and I talked to Qin and the others.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.670
We think you're highly capable,

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:25.790
have a good rapport with the community,

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.450
and are excellent all around.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:28.720
So I was thinking...

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.730
We're busy here.

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.040
Let's cut to the chase.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:32.600
Alright.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:35.360
I heard you want to transfer here

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.390
so your two sons can
attend middle school in the city.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.630
Yes.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.840
Whether it's getting into the bureau

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.240
or your kids' schooling,

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:45.460
I can help with both.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:46.720
But,

00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:48.350
I have one condition.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.390
Once you're in,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.400
you join our Narcotics Unit.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.780
Right here.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.490
Ken,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.890
wait here a second.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.780
I need to talk to Bao first.

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:32.150
He doesn't know you're here to sell.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.160
Don't make me wait too long.

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.020
It'll be quick.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.910
Is that Chuan?

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.080
Bao.

00:13:56.430 --> 00:13:57.310
Bao.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.380
Where's the guy you mentioned?

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.980
I told him to wait in the yard.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.240
What does he want to buy?

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.150
Weed, meth,

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:07.080
ecstasy, or Ketamine?

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:08.670
He...

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:11.200
That idiot isn't here to buy goods.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.750
He's here to sell.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.000
What the hell?

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.630
Are you stupid?

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:18.880
It's not me.

00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:19.720
He...

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.750
We just stick to selling fakes.

00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:23.840
Whoever buys our stuff

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.030
won't go to the cops to report us, right?

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.390
Yeah.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.360
Taking their money is practically
doing the world a favor.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.550
I know that.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:30.720
So why'd you hook up with
someone selling the real stuff?

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.120
I...

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.510
He...

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:33.360
Don't you know
how serious drug dealing is?

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.440
I know.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.390
We can't throw

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:36.320
our lives away this young.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:36.840
Yes.

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:38.180
Get him out of here.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:38.630
Get him out.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:39.840
Wait,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.040
I came to you for help.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.230
Help me

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.140
get rid of him.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:51.900
He hit you,

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:53.510
and you brought him here?

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.870
Figure out a way to send him away.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:57.670
What can I do?

00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:59.360
Just say I don't buy from strangers.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:14:59.870
Let him leave.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.910
He won't leave until you see him.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:03.150
What do you want me to do?

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.840
Think of a way to kick him out.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.790
Just say his goods are no good.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.650
But I'll get beaten up if I go back.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.670
Who's it?

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.500
This is Ken.

00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:17.030
Bao.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:17.840
Ken,

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:19.890
didn't I tell you to wait outside?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:22.870
Uh,

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.720
let him come in.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:44.330
Which crew do you run with?

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.840
I'm not with anyone.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:47.880
Just here to sell.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.250
Have a seat.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.050
Get him a chair.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.790
Let me do it.

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.870
So,

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:11.310
Chuan

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.090
told me everything.

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:14.440
Dude, you...

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:16.740
have the wrong person.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:18.360
I

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:19.550
only sell.

00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:21.000
I don't buy.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:22.320
Right.

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:23.670
I already talked to Bao.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.770
If you don't buy,

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.960
what do you sell?

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.270
I don't buy from strangers.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:31.400
Go find someone else.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.110
Yes.

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.770
See him out.

00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.480
Ken,

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:33.840
you just...

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.390
How about this?

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:35.390
Take a look first.

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:36.710
See what I've got.

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:45.600
Calm down.

00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:47.720
There's two of us.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:49.460
You're alone.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.870
If it comes to a fight,

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:52.720
you might not win.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440
Stand over there.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:07.349
Alright.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:08.510
Take the goods out.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.460
Let me see the quality.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.560
Faker!

00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:51.210
Dude,

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.930
you're way too amateur.

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.260
You take some rose sea salt

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:56.640
and dare to pass it off as drugs?

00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.170
Can you make money off this?

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:00.030
Look.

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:01.830
It's fake?

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.350
Trying to fool me?

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:05.240
No, this is real.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.350
It was smuggled in inside a stomach.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.070
It's the real deal.

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:09.200
Bao said it's fake.

00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:10.000
It's real.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.960
Let me teach you a lesson.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:12.900
Come here.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:14.310
Tell me,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.280
what's this?

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:19.860
Meth.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.960
He calls this meth.

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.130
This moron.

00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:27.920
Isn't he?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.790
Since we're in the same trade,

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.830
and you're already here,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:31.750
I'll open your eyes today.

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:33.960
So you don't shame
our profession out there.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.520
Show him.

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:35.350
Show him.

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:36.030
Bring it out.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.270
You scared me to death.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:38.350
Honestly,

00:18:38.350 --> 00:18:39.610
you made me so nervous.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.110
Come over here.

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:46.590
Look. Come on.

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:48.730
Take a look.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:50.900
Learn something.

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.780
Stuff that looks

00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:55.500
like rock sugar

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:56.880
is real meth.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.200
Here, hold it.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.750
Study it.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.320
This is

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.550
ecstasy.

00:19:05.670 --> 00:19:06.300
Weed.

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600
This is serious.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:11.540
Enough to get you executed.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:13.240
Heroin.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.160
I made

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:16.980
all this by comparing

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.480
pictures online, one by one.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:22.420
You can't tell the difference
with the naked eye.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:24.030
Unlike you,

00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.550
taking some rose sea salt

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.250
and pretending it's meth.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:30.070
You won't scam any money with that.

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.340
You sell fakes?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.750
You sell fakes too, don't you?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:44.830
Mine is real.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.380
Don't you think I can tell?

00:19:46.510 --> 00:19:47.800
The stuff is right here.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:49.600
One taste and the jig is up.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.830
It's real.

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:52.690
Don't taste it.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.740
Stop bluffing me.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.020
Come on, you actually took it seriously?

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:03.940
What the hell does this taste like?

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.560
Where did you get this?

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:07.590
Get me some water.

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:10.180
Isn't it sea salt?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:12.360
Here.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:22.750
Give me more.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.940
What is this stuff?

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:30.130
Bao, drink more water.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.030
Keep drinking.

00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:37.550
What's wrong?

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:38.410
What happened?

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.700
What's this stuff?

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.070
I told you it's real!

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.550
But you won't believe me!

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.030
Help!

00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.270
Hot!

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:46.790
I'm hot!

00:20:46.790 --> 00:20:48.190
Give him some more water.

00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.030
Help!

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.310
What does this mean?

00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:53.790
How should I know?

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.270
It's your stuff!

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:56.810
He's not gonna make it.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.270
Call 120.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.440
I'm calling 120.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:00.240
Don't call 120.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.500
They'll call the cops.

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.350
So what if they call the cops?

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.720
I didn't break the law.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.480
Hang up!

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:06.930
Put it down.

00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:08.160
Put it down.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:10.720
Put it down.

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:12.060
Put...

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:14.400
It's just you and me now.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.720
If I get caught,

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.640
I'll say you're both my accomplices.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:19.970
None of us will get away.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.440
It's not about getting away.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.440
Bao is like this now.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.350
What do we do?

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.200
I don't know what to do.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.510
You don't know?

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.590
How am I supposed to know?

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:28.320
Then I'll...

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.550
call an ambulance, okay?

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:30.350
No, you can't.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:31.030
Try something else.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.640
You...

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.200
Try what?

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:33.830
Pinch his philtrum.

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:34.290
Pinch it!

00:21:34.290 --> 00:21:35.420
Pinch the philtrum!

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:37.790
Bao.

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:38.620
Bao.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.040
He's not breathing.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.620
He's not breathing!

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:10.090
What do we do?

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:26.550
Ken,

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:27.540
what do we do?

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.000
What do we do now?

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.230
Dad.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.550
Find a realtor we know tomorrow.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.390
Ask how much our house is worth.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:21.330
Selling the house?

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.200
Is your transfer confirmed?

00:23:28.930 --> 00:23:29.990
Soon. Almost done.

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:33.160
Oh my.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:37.690
I've lived in Nuanhai Town my whole life.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.480
All my friends and colleagues are here.

00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:42.590
Besides, if I really have to leave,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:45.650
there's all those
membership cards, prepaid cards...

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.260
And

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.160
I just topped up
at the foot massage place.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.360
I know you don't want to move to the city.

00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:53.910
That's not what you said before.

00:23:54.550 --> 00:23:56.200
When you first brought it up,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.680
nothing was settled.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.270
I just agreed casually.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.280
Who knew you'd get it done so fast?

00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.660
Then you'll have to
take care of them for me.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:08.440
They're not going with you?

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.680
I'll have a heavy workload
when I first get there.

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.960
And their transfer procedures

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.510
will take some time.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:15.310
Fine.

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.890
Let the kids
keep me company for now.

00:24:18.630 --> 00:24:21.040
But there's something
you need to think about.

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.370
How to tell the kids

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.700
about the separation.

00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:25.460
Kids at this age

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:26.040
are

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:28.080
very sensitive.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.680
I'll just tell the truth.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.410
I have to say it sooner or later.

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:36.180
Give it a try.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.510
Ming, Zhi.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.650
Stop writing. Come here.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:41.510
Come out first.

00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.790
Did you wash your hands?

00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:43.270
He didn't wash his hands.

00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:44.240
Neither did he.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:45.590
These kids.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.550
Never mind.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:48.650
Sit down. I have something to say.

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:49.660
Can you get in?

00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:50.070
We're in.

00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:52.200
Sit here. I have something to tell you.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:53.960
Here's the thing.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.310
I have a job transfer.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.110
Maybe

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.070
I'll be

00:24:57.270 --> 00:24:58.000
work in the city

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.590
in the very near future.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:00.920
As for you,

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.410
once I'm settled,

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.660
I'll arrange your school

00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.010
in the city as well.

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:07.220
You'll get a better education there.

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.700
During this time,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.760
you two will live with Grandpa.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.600
So for now,

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:12.720
you two

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.480
wait for Mom here with me.

00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:17.280
Are you abandoning us?

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.960
We won't be naughty anymore.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.750
Nonsense. How's that possible?

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:21.270
My little darlings,

00:25:21.270 --> 00:25:22.510
you're my sons.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.730
How would a mother abandon her kids?

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.480
That will never happen.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.400
I promise you.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.200
It will absolutely never happen.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.400
It's just for a very short time.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.200
You'll live with Grandpa first.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.590
And although we won't see each other,

00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:35.070
we can make

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.590
video calls every day.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:37.400
Right.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.200
Every day.

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.310
Before you leave,

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:40.590
give the iPad back to the kids.

00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:41.400
Sure. I will.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.220
I'll give it back right away.

00:25:42.220 --> 00:25:42.660
Okay?

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:44.480
Can we really video call every day?

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:46.160
Absolutely. I promise.

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:46.930
Who's it?

00:25:47.310 --> 00:25:47.920
I'll go.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:49.830
We'll call every day.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:51.110
You can tell me

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:52.550
what happened during the day at school.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:54.270
And I'll tell you about my day too,

00:25:54.270 --> 00:25:54.750
okay?

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.000
Then when will you come to get us?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.440
As soon as possible.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.160
Who

00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.270
are you looking for?

00:25:59.270 --> 00:25:59.790
Hello, sir.

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:00.650
I'm looking for

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.380
Hu Wenjing.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:03.800
-Wenjing.
-What brings you here?

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.920
How did you find this place?

00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:05.310
This is...

00:26:05.310 --> 00:26:06.310
My colleague.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:08.590
-Come on.
-Come in.

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.110
Come on.

00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.640
Come in.

00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:12.370
-What did you buy?
-Come in.

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.470
I brought some fruit for you.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:49.000
Ken.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:50.370
I...

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.300
shouldn't bother wiping.

00:26:53.060 --> 00:26:54.980
I come here every few days.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.130
My fingerprints are everywhere.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.830
The cops

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:03.330
will definitely trace it back to me.

00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:05.260
How about this?

00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.830
You...

00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:08.790
You just let me turn myself in.

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:09.670
Okay?

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.200
Turn yourself in?

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.050
Won't you still get sentenced?

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.610
I didn't break the law.

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:22.700
You were dealing drugs.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.550
They were fake.

00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:26.900
Fake.

00:27:28.050 --> 00:27:28.730
Fake?

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.410
Isn't dealing fakes against the law?

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.810
What law does that break?

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.350
At the very least, it's fraud.

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:36.810
Wait...

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.600
You can't turn yourself in.

00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.680
Besides, there's real stuff here too.

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:57.820
If you get caught,

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.490
even if you explain yourself,

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.070
it was you who brought me here,

00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:03.270
which got him killed.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.680
Isn't that right?

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.210
What do I do now?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:17.830
Say something.

00:28:17.830 --> 00:28:19.180
What exactly do you want me to do?

00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.580
He died from an overdose.

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:22.520
What overdose?

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.620
It has nothing to do with us.

00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.670
Nothing to do with us?

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:26.330
Where did the drugs come from?

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:27.510
I don't know.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:29.630
You don't know either.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:31.470
Neither of us knows.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.750
Once we walk out that door,

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:34.640
I'll go home,

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:36.080
and you'll run.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.550
Let's pretend nothing happened.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:43.610
If you ever get caught,

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:46.510
you cannot rat me out.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.960
If you don't help me...

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.190
There's only a small amount of drugs,

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:58.190
and we didn't make any transaction.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.490
I won't be sentenced for long.

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:04.520
But I have a seriously ill daughter.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:09.200
If I go to prison,

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.310
she won't survive.

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.310
If that happens,

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:18.390
for the rest of my life,

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:21.790
my only purpose for living

00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:23.410
will be to kill you.

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.590
To kill you.

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.750
I don't care if you

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.440
just get out of prison,

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:31.590
or if you're going to work,

00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.430
buying groceries,

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:33.590
eating, or sleeping.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:34.450
I will catch you

00:29:34.590 --> 00:29:36.270
in any moment of weakness,

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.350
jump out suddenly,

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.310
and kill you.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:43.810
Kill you.

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:50.510
Do you believe me?

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.480
Bao,

00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.660
I brought you so many clients,

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:54.600
and all you ever gave me were scraps.

00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.820
You took such advantage of me,

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.310
bullying me.

00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:07.140
Bao,

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.110
I'll

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:09.580
leave you 20,000

00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:10.550
to buy a coffin.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.310
Bao,

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.290
don't blame me.

00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:20.150
Don't blame me.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:22.350
I left you 20,000 to buy a coffin.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.500
Don't blame me.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.200
Don't blame me.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.640
I'll kill you.

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:38.070
A phone call would've done it.

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.790
Why did you come all the way to my home?

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:41.160
Who gave you my address?

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.200
Wait,

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.350
can you stop talking to me

00:32:43.350 --> 00:32:45.130
like you're interrogating a suspect?

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.250
What is it? Spit it out.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:47.340
Got any new leads?

00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.650
Although Ding Lai is dead,

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.720
the drugs he intended to buy
weren't found.

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:53.960
The city bureau asked me to stay here

00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.740
to continue investigating
the whereabouts of that batch.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:57.260
Okay.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.130
What, you three want in on the mission?

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.920
Might as well have
the whole family join the force.

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:03.650
Um, Wenjing,

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.320
I don't know your colleague's

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.310
-name yet.
-Jin Longzheng.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:07.550
You can call me Jin.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:08.490
Jin.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.200
I see.

00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:10.310
I'll go cook a couple more dishes.

00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:11.110
Stay for dinner.

00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.640
No need. He's leaving.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.240
Right now.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.510
Yes, I'm leaving now.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:14.450
Make yourself at home.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:15.850
Since you're here,

00:33:15.870 --> 00:33:17.630
you've gotta try my cooking.

00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:19.000
Really, you must.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:19.880
This is the first time

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.190
a male colleague of Wenjing's
has ever come over.

00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.870
Just wait.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:28.370
It won't take long.

00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:39.820
Have some water.

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.090
Go on.

00:33:48.810 --> 00:33:50.650
So, Wu came to you, didn't he?

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.050
You're well-informed.

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.530
Did he ask you to join the Narcotics Unit?

00:33:56.930 --> 00:33:57.510
He mentioned it.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:33:58.640
Don't listen to him.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.770
Narcotics isn't for you.

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.450
How is it for you but not for me?

00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:03.270
Look, ability-wise,

00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:04.740
you could be my mentor.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.220
But narcotics work
is dangerous and grueling.

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.570
Not for a single mother.

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.840
Especially one with two kids

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:11.389
and an elderly parent to care for.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:13.050
And they're all here locally.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:16.489
He said he could help
with my kids' schooling.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.400
No. 3 Middle School
isn't hard to get into.

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.060
We can figure out another way.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.300
Why are you meddling so much?

00:34:23.300 --> 00:34:24.659
Why do you keep interfering
in my business?

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:25.730
Mind your own business.

00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:27.469
Stop running around on that gimpy leg.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:28.710
Rest more when you can.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:29.370
Go back now.

00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:32.670
Okay.

00:34:34.510 --> 00:34:35.510
Just think

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:36.710
about what I said.

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:37.290
Okay.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.150
And when you

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:39.550
call Wu next time,

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:40.480
let me know.

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:41.800
I don't need to tell you.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:42.860
I'll make the call.

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:44.409
Alright.

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.590
Dad,

00:34:45.989 --> 00:34:47.449
Jin Longzheng is leaving.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.199
Uncle, I'm heading off.

00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:50.920
Jin, don't go.

00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.070
I'm halfway through cooking.

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.190
Who's gonna eat all this if you leave?

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:54.150
He's got things to do.

00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.630
No way.

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.480
I really have things to do.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.110
You have to eat.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:56.710
Hurry.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.440
Listen to me.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:00.030
You must stay for dinner.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.410
Sit.

00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:01.060
Come on.

00:35:01.150 --> 00:35:01.880
Ming, Zhi,

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:03.480
keep our guest company.

00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:04.770
I'll be right back.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.280
This dish has been touched.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:06.670
No good.

00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:07.230
It hasn't.

00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.590
It's fine.

00:35:07.590 --> 00:35:08.360
Untouched.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.230
This one's been touched.

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:10.280
Give me a hand.

00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:11.300
Sit down.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.320
Just sit.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:13.030
Sit.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.210
Sorry for the trouble, Uncle.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:15.960
Just wait.

00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:16.760
Almost ready.

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.590
What are you doing here?

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:19.760
This one's really untouched.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.710
This one's been touched too.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.480
We can't serve this to a guest.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.850
He's handsome.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:27.410
I like the look of him.

00:35:28.110 --> 00:35:29.110
Is he your colleague?

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:29.670
Where's he from?

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:30.480
City bureau.

00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.670
Colleague for now.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.340
If your transfer works out,

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.300
you'll be together every day
at the city bureau.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:36.840
Oh my goodness.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.070
He's like 7 or 8 years younger than me.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:39.590
Don't play matchmaker.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:40.280
You're messing around.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.360
Sweetie,

00:35:42.110 --> 00:35:43.920
you wouldn't be losing out.

00:35:52.110 --> 00:35:53.800
Who exactly are you?

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.680
I'm the champion of the Haizhou

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:01.140
Police Academy's martial arts tournament.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.110
Seriously?

00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:04.960
You really know martial arts?

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.020
I know kickboxing.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:07.320
Can you teach us?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:08.880
Teach you?

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:10.360
Sure.

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:12.730
You'll have to eat all your food first.

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:13.860
Then I'll teach you.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.400
Dad.

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.950
Where did this egg custard come from?

00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:12.310
I made it myself.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.440
Didn't I already make

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.920
your meals before I left?

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.410
Why'd you make egg custard?

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.340
Who taught you?

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:20.780
You used the pot—it's so heavy.

00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:21.770
The stove is so high.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:23.360
What if you burned yourself lighting it?

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.420
It's so dangerous.

00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:30.490
You've been out all day.

00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:33.670
I wanted you to come home to hot food.

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.140
It's really good.

00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.840
Eat more if you like it.

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.670
Dad, what's wrong?

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.560
I'm just thinking...

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.590
Doing bad things is so hard.

00:38:46.650 --> 00:38:48.480
Aren't we good people?

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:50.730
Why do we have to do bad things?

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.840
Eat more.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.150
Come on, sit.

00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:21.110
Jin,

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.840
I heard you

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:24.000
got hurt a bit.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:24.840
Are you better now?

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.570
Much better.

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.510
Well, did you

00:39:26.770 --> 00:39:29.370
have some IV fluids,
anti-inflammatories...

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:31.930
I can drink a little.

00:39:33.550 --> 00:39:34.550
I'll get the wine.

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:36.510
One more dish.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:37.810
How can we eat all this?

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.810
Why are you behaving so well today?

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.400
Mom, look, we finished everything.

00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:45.640
We'll do the dishes.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.120
It's easy for men to communicate.

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:51.080
Brothers do communicate well.

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.250
Let me see how you wash dishes.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:55.670
Here.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:56.550
Let me.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:57.110
I got it.

00:39:57.110 --> 00:39:57.710
No, no.

00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:59.290
It's your first time here.

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:00.210
You're a guest.

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.190
Let me.

00:40:01.290 --> 00:40:01.810
Here.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:21.810
Jiajia.

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.730
Come.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.590
Sit here.

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:31.140
I want to talk to you.

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:38.590
I know.

00:40:38.830 --> 00:40:39.620
Jiajia,

00:40:40.130 --> 00:40:42.420
compared to many other kids,

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.180
you're smarter

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:45.610
and more sensible.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:48.980
So I usually try to treat you

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.430
like a grown-up

00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:51.870
and discuss things with you.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.540
Right?

00:40:54.420 --> 00:40:57.280
Do you understand
what's going on at home right now?

00:40:58.900 --> 00:40:59.900
Good.

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.530
My

00:41:01.950 --> 00:41:04.240
No.1 task right now is to make money.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.440
Only if I make money

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.070
can we keep living

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.250
and treat your illness.

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:15.580
But I can't let anyone know

00:41:16.510 --> 00:41:18.070
the way I'm making money.

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:21.010
If Xiaoyu

00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:23.320
stays with us,

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.550
it might put me in danger.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:30.230
So I've decided

00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:33.030
to send Xiaoyu away for a while.

00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:40.260
The doctor said I don't need
a kidney transplant yet.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:42.800
You don't need to do dangerous things.

00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:43.490
Yes.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:45.540
The doctor did say that.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:46.720
But,

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:48.100
look, the doctor also said

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.020
"yet."

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.190
It's only for now.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
We have to face this sooner or later.

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.260
Jiajia, remember one thing.

00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:01.360
In this world,

00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.050
except for me,

00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:06.800
no one will treat you well for no reason.

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:10.470
What do we do
when we encounter difficulties?

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:12.330
We can only solve them with money.

00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:14.660
So I have to do something.

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.900
As for Xiaoyu,

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:20.250
I can promise you.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.550
When I've dealt with all the problems

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:24.610
and made the money,

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.630
I'll take you with me

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:27.590
to pick up Xiaoyu.

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:28.590
We'll go to a...

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:30.550
a new place to live.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.760
To live a good life there.

00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:36.550
Xiaoyu is our family's benefactor.

00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.490
We'll always be good to her.

00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:41.230
Why is Xiaoyu

00:42:41.230 --> 00:42:43.000
our family's benefactor?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:57.300
