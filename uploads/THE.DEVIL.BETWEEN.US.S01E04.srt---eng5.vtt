[Episode 4]

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.509
MIX CLUB

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:51.350
is one of the few nightlife spots

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.920
in the county.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.470
It doesn't open until 7:30 PM,

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.830
so there's nothing to find if we go now.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.050
I've got an idea.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.000
Let's check out
the electronics factory first.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.120
Lots of workers there—

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.480
we might pick up what we need.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.480
Also, I've got a friend inside.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.950
If we're going in to ask around,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.150
she can keep an eye out for us.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.950
It's easier
when you've got someone on the inside.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.760
Hu Wenjing,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.670
I've thought it over.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.510
Jin Longfeng's death

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.570
wasn't on you.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.470
As a detective,

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.090
you know Nuanhai Town better than I do.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.040
Director Dai was right;

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:25.960
you're the best person for the job.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.560
Let's put the past behind us.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.910
We were just doing our jobs.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.750
It's all work.

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.520
Alright.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.030
Here's the plan.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.710
I'll reassign the tasks.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.750
I'll head to the electronics factory

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.750
and see what I can find later.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.500
You take Jin back to the station

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.840
and go over the crime scene footage again.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.240
Okay.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.360
Let's put together
Liu Qiang's social connections.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.480
When I get back,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.280
we'll pool everything we've got.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.750
Tonight we check out
that bar you mentioned—

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:50.450
MIX CLUB.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:51.240
That bar.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.800
It's settled.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.430
Got it.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.579
What are you doing?

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:58.050
Hurry up!

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.310
You look pretty young.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:17.870
Did you just start working?

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Three years in.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.810
You look fresh out of college.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.990
I'm not interested in talking about
anything unrelated to the case.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.520
What's your relationship with Yang Xinyu,
Liu Qiang's nephew?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.720
We've met a few times.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.710
My dad is friends with Liu Qiang.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:39.630
They even tried to set up

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.520
a blind date for me and Yang Xinyu.

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.500
Since you've got
personal ties to the victim's family,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.900
you should recuse yourself from this case.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.310
You grew up in the city, didn't you?

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.150
You don't get how small towns work.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.910
Around here, it's normal for everyone

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.870
to know everyone.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.000
If we had to step aside every time

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.800
we knew someone,

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.840
no one would be left to do the job.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.710
Narcotics cases

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.680
fall under our jurisdiction.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.310
You detectives shouldn't be
sticking your nose in.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.000
What do you mean by that?

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.590
Director Dai told us to coordinate.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.030
Even Qin's put his bias aside.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.000
If you've got a problem with me,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.870
just say it.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:15.780
I don't.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.120
Jin Longfeng was your brother, wasn't he?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.120
Who told you that?

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.430
No one had to.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.960
The name, the resemblance…

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.800
The way you fixate on the Ding Lai case—

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.430
and the way you look at me.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.390
I know what you're thinking.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.650
If you hadn't shown up that day,

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.560
my brother wouldn't have died.

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.610
Jin Longzheng,

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.480
I didn't know your brother.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.680
But he was the first colleague

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.390
I ever saw die in front of me.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.360
I'm sorry.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.750
No one wants to watch

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.010
their partner go down.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.040
But listen—

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.170
everyone knows what happened.

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.520
It was an accident.

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.870
It was just an accident.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.190
I know what people are thinking—

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.600
that if I

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600
hadn't shown up that day,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.040
maybe things would've
turned out differently.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.390
Maybe Jin Longfeng wouldn't have died.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.720
I admit that is possible.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.830
But it happened.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:20.030
We can't change that.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.270
I've been a cop for ten years.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.920
Up before dawn, home past midnight.
I worked my ass off

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:26.240
to earn people's trust.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.600
They thought I do a good job

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.040
and wanted to entrust me
with important tasks.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.680
But just because of this one accident,

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.750
my reputation in the entire
Haizhou public security system,

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.360
which I spent

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.620
almost a lifetime building up,
has completely collapsed.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.880
Is that fair to me?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:41.830
I understand you.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.190
You hate me when you see me.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.070
But even so,

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.240
I will still cooperate fully with you,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.500
because this is my job.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.390
If you really hate me that much,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.450
then turn that hatred into strength.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.120
Go catch those drug dealers and criminals.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.630
Don't engage in infighting with me here.

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.240
Okay?

[Nuanfeng County People's Hospital]

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.950
Director.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:20.600
Cheng Ken,

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.730
you're quite lucky.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:23.920
You found a donor

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.770
whose HLA markers
are a perfect six-point match

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.920
for your daughter.

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:28.660
That's extremely rare.

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.640
So,

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.560
the surgery's possible?

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.830
It must be my family

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.630
up in heaven

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.460
watching over Jiajia.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.560
It's fine.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.000
Since you've got a match,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.830
I'll schedule the operation
as soon as possible.

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.390
Okay.

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:48.070
No.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.950
Not now.

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.480
I haven't finalized things with the donor.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.310
Whatever you pay them

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.830
is between you and them.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.650
You've already prepaid

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.610
the surgery fee.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.159
Though part of it
was used for Jiajia's hospitalization

00:06:58.159 --> 00:06:59.040
these past couple of days.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.480
Right.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.530
After the transplant,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.430
she must take
anti-rejection medication long term.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:06.690
Those, plus the necessary supplements,

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.710
will run about 100,000 yuan a year.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.350
That's a heavy burden

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.390
for most families.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.070
You need to be prepared for that.

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:17.070
I know.

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.070
I know.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.390
Anyway, it's good news.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:25.950
Good news.

00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:26.390
Good news.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.990
Good news.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.830
Thank you, Director.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:28.360
Okay.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.740
I'll get going.

Are you busy?

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.690
Go ahead.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.700
Can you lend me some money?

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.560
Sure.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:25.960
How much do you need?

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.160
What's the most you can lend me?

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.680
I told you before—

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.789
I can free up over 20,000 yuan.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:35.909
Okay.

00:08:36.549 --> 00:08:39.700
I already borrowed 50,000 yuan from you.

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:43.330
And you can still come up
with another 20,000.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:45.270
I don't know what to say.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.360
But

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:47.750
thank you.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:48.750
Thanks, brother.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.060
I'll remember this.

We're brothers.

Why are you being so polite?

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.630
I'll transfer it to you tomorrow.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.240
Thank you.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.030
Bye.

And this one too.

She is pretty good.

Wait, I just washed some grapes for you.

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:52.920
What's wrong?

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:01.080
You interrupted my train of thought.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.340
Why are you losing your temper like this?

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.080
I'm going out for some fresh air.

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.980

You're eating way too fast.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:58.240
Didn't I tell you already?

00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.700
You can only take one a day.

00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:03.360
I stayed up late yesterday
trying to learn more.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.630
Don't worry about my affairs.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:06.160
Just tell me if you have any.

That's all I have.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:12.390
You have to promise me

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.650
you won't come back for more for two days.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:16.220
Five for two days is enough.

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.480
This time,

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:19.760
it's 150 per pill.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:20.890
So it's 750 in total.

Why is the price going up?

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.030
The price is set by

supply and demand.

It's not cheap.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:25.380
How much is it?

A gram costs a few thousand.

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:31.350
How much a gram?

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:35.380
It depends on what kind you want.

00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.280
The "off-grade,"

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.100
the "mid-grade,"

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.230
or the "top-grade"?

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:46.870
What's the difference?

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:47.800

Of course it's safe.

Think about it.

What does this mean?

I don't know.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.480
I don't know what's going on.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.400
Does this happen often?

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.350
No, it's never happened before.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.330
Take them to line up by the restrooms.

00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:30.200
Stand still.

Go line up over there!

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.400
Search the bags thoroughly.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.590
Check the IDs.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.180
Did you find anything unusual today?

00:19:43.060 --> 00:19:44.300
Anything unusual?

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:48.200
Did you notice any suspicious suspects

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.400
walking around here?

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:50.030
Yes.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:50.960
Who was it?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:52.920
Don't just check IDs.

We've basically
got everyone under control.

You can start questioning

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:01.920
whenever you're ready.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:02.200
Okay.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:03.790
We'll just do a quick sweep

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:04.240
Alright.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.100
and ask around.

Hurry up and pee.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:09.790

You too, get in.

Get in.

Officer,

what's going on?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:17.920
Why are there so many cops tonight?

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:18.640
Not so many questions.

Go in, quickly.

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:19.920
You, that one.

Okay.

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:23.090
Don't close the door. Keep it open.

Wait,

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:29.640
I can't pee with the door open
and so many people.

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.440
What? Do you want to come back
to the station to pee?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:33.640
I'll pee.

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.530
Pee.

What's the situation?

just now at the bar,

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.000
I saw two people buying something.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.310
Did you see them make a deal?

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.720
Yes, yes.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.050
Did you see exactly what they were buying?

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:58.950
He said he was buying
something to get high.

00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.280
Where are those two now?

00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:01.830
They were just taken to the restroom.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:03.890
Where is the restroom? Take me there.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:05.920
Stop!

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:06.410
Don't run!

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.540
Freeze! Don't move!

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:14.960
What are you looking at?

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:15.790
Just focus on peeing.

00:21:15.790 --> 00:21:16.790
Stop stalling.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:20.920
Pin him down.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.790
Cuff him.

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.300
What's wrong?

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.900
Nothing. Someone just tried to run.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:28.530
We got him.

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:31.200
Get in.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:32.280
Stay inside.

00:21:39.090 --> 00:21:39.850
Okay.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:42.420
Just those two.

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:43.510
Which two?

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.240
The fat guy in the floral shirt

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.160
and the one with greasy hair.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.590
Okay, I got it.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:49.160
You can go back.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:49.640
Okay.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:51.590
None of your business.

00:21:51.740 --> 00:21:52.870
Go. Go wait outside.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:57.830
Don't go over there.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.160
Come back to the station with us.

00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.550
Me?

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.110
What did I do?

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.550
You'll find out

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.200
when you get to the station.

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:01.440
Wait.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.640
My two friends are waiting for me there.

00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:05.210
Cheng Ken,

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.210
what are you doing here?

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:09.110
I...

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.110
I just came to take a look.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.840
Look at what?

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:15.790
I was just looking around.

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:16.880
I've been really depressed lately.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:17.400
Don't go back.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:19.200
Come back to the station with us.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:20.310
I just came to take a look.

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.510
I didn't...

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.400
We'll talk
when we get back to the station.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:21.930
Let's go.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.070
Hurry back.

00:22:36.050 --> 00:22:37.880
What's going on with the guy up ahead?

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.810
He had some date-rape drugs on him.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.640
When we caught him, he tried to run,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.680
probably worried his family
or workplace would find out.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.160
And we caught him red-handed.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:46.670
Go.

00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.910
Director Dai.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.690
Didn't you sleep all night?

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.200
I still think this bar's suspicious,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.480
but staying here all night
didn't reveal anything.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.640
The two we brought back last night

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.790
didn't lead us to anything either.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:19.310
One of them was just

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.640
looking for some fun

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.550
because life's been too stressful.

00:23:21.550 --> 00:23:23.080
The other was just a thug

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.250
trying to scam some money.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.360
I spent the whole night
running around for nothing,

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.890
and my throat's killing me.

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.050
For cops,

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.260
this is pretty normal.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:35.470
You should get some rest.

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.240
Look at your face—

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.880
it's the color of a potato.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:40.600
I'm fine. This afternoon I'll go...

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:42.380
I need to check Liu Qiang's
social connections.

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.840
That hasn't been done yet.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.840
Are you not picking up the kid

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.840
this afternoon?

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:47.720
Yeah.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.680
It's fine; my dad is there.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.160
You

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.400
take a break when you can.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.070
I'm fine.

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.320
Okay.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:57.960
Sorry.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:58.510
Why are you so startled?

00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:59.200
I'm clearing my throat.

00:23:59.200 --> 00:23:59.830
I, uh...

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:01.800
I need to wake myself up.

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:02.680
Get some rest.

00:24:03.410 --> 00:24:05.140
What's wrong with your throat?

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:22.960
Cao Jinchuan!

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:24.070
Wake up!

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.040
That's it?

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.500
Are you sleepy?

00:24:41.270 --> 00:24:42.110
Wait, sir…

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.070
I've told you

00:24:43.070 --> 00:24:43.680
everything

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.630
I needed to.

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.800
Print it out.

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.110
Look at that.

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:51.450
Sir, you've got good insight.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:52.880
Be serious.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.680
Remember, we can call you back anytime.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:56.710
Understood.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.680
Officer,

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:03.120
is there anything else?

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.960
My daughter is home alone.

00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:10.310
I'm worried she'll wake up

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.920
and be scared if I'm not there.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.000
Could I…

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:15.690
Director Dai.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.300
Hello.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:54.820
Take a look.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.730
If everything looks fine,

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:57.350
please sign here

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.810
and put your fingerprint.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:25:59.680
Same here—

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.090
just put a fingerprint

00:26:00.090 --> 00:26:00.890
here too.

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.910
Officer, may I ask your name?

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.540
My last name's Jin.

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.320
Officer Jin,

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.350
I've learned my lesson today.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.360
It won't happen again, I promise.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.820
Thank you for helping me out.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.590
Thank you.

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:38.060
Go.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.270
Morning.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:53.070
Ken,

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:55.400
why are you only getting here now?

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.030
I...

00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:58.470
I forgot about the overtime today.

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.410
I took my daughter to the hospital
for a check-up.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.720
Is she sick again?

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:07.960
Listen,

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:09.590
Mr. Sun came by looking for you earlier.
He couldn't find you

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:10.790
and got really mad.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.130
What happened?

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.580
You didn't book
the outreach invoices, did you?

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.240
Right.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:17.890
I forgot.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.000
I haven't gone to see them yet.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.200
Why go to them?

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.350
Why don't you get it?

00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.070
Ken,

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:25.550
isn't that a bit much?

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.830
Everyone in the department
is working overtime today,

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:29.090
and you're still late.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.220
I'm sorry, Mr. Sun.

00:27:30.550 --> 00:27:31.440
Something came up at home last night.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.200
Come with me.

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:50.680
Ken,

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.200
I actually

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.960
do appreciate

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.540
your work ethic.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:27:59.270
Thank you.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:00.830
But

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:04.790
this matter wasn't handled well.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.440
Last time when I treated the
whole department to dinner,

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.500
I made it clear that

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.870
those in finance

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.790
need to be flexible

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.200
and not so rigid.

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:15.530
Right?

00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.680
Right.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.080
I understand your point.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.070
But our factory

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.960
has an internal audit system.

00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.070
You take two days off every week,

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.890
and I've never made things
difficult for you,

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:31.440
right?

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.960
Yes.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.510
I really appreciate everything

00:28:34.510 --> 00:28:36.970
you've done for me,
and I haven't forgotten.

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:42.660
But these invoices really can't be filed—

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.580
they're risky,

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:45.570
and the risk is pretty big.

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.170
If it's discovered,

00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:49.660
I could lose my job.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:52.390
You know about my family situation too.

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:00.680
I understand.

00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.750
Look,

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.320
don't worry about this one.

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:09.790
I'll let Wu handle it.

00:29:10.030 --> 00:29:11.350
She's more flexible than you

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:12.810
and has a brighter future.

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:28.510
After the transplant,

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:31.350
must take anti-rejection medication
long term.

00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:32.030
Those,

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:33.680
plus the necessary supplements,

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.610
will run about 100,000 yuan a year.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:47.620
Mr. Sun.

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.360
I didn't express myself clearly just now.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.350
I can take this risk.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.590
But can the outreach team
be a little flexible too?

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:09.880
You surprise me.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.090
Alright,

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.010
go see the contact over there

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:27.860
and talk to him.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.390
Thank you.

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:39.550
You're like

00:31:41.510 --> 00:31:43.840
one of those instant noodles come to life.

00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:45.640
What? Instant noodles?

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.480
I'm way paler

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.310
than that.

00:31:49.350 --> 00:31:50.350
A lot has happened

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.110
this month.

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:54.350
Yeah.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.200
Why are you so sleepy?

00:31:57.550 --> 00:31:59.010
Did you stay up late again?

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:00.310
Don't remind me.

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.270
I was watching surveillance footage
all night—

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.400
didn't find a thing.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.170
There wasn't a single lead.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.200
But I did see Wang An

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.200
hanging around outside that bar.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.110
I mean, instead of studying,

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.350
he's out messing around.

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.160
Wang Ping will be here soon;

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.560
I really need to have a proper talk
with her.

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.350
Let's call it a day.

00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:18.110
Look at you—

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.220
you look awful.

00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:20.380
Don't pass out on me.

00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:23.680
Find a needle and sew your mouth shut.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:24.880
Why isn't she here yet?

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.280
Call her and check on her.

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.900
Alright, I'll make a call.

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:30.110
You have so many phones.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.640
Can you…

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:32.330
It's for work.

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.400
I'm so busy.

00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:34.530
I need two phones.

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.880
She's not answering.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.480
Something's wrong.

00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:45.110
She's usually on time.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.510
She's not answering today,

00:32:46.510 --> 00:32:47.840
and she hasn't shown up.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.200
Is everything okay?

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:41.310
She's probably home.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:42.610
Is she home?

00:33:43.310 --> 00:33:44.070
Wang Ping!

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.880
Wang Ping!

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.550
Her phone is ringing.

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.730
She's home.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.670
Wang Ping!

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.100
Did something happen?

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.950
Wang Ping!

00:33:59.210 --> 00:34:00.720
She should be up by now!

00:34:03.510 --> 00:34:04.240
Wang Ping!

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:06.640
Wang Ping!

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:09.030
Oh no.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.760
Li Xiaoya!

00:34:12.909 --> 00:34:13.710
I'm going up.

00:34:13.790 --> 00:34:14.580
Going up?

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:16.550
Be careful.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:17.150
It's okay.

00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:21.590
Be careful.

00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:31.630
Wang Ping!

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:35.920
Wang Ping!

00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:44.219
Wang Ping!

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:45.620
What's wrong?

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:47.800
What's wrong?

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.510
Wang Ping!

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:49.900
What's wrong?

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.590
Don't come any closer!

00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:52.320
What's going on?

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:52.710
I...

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.110
I'm Hu Wenjing.

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.370
Don't come any closer!

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.400
It's okay.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:57.150
Wang Ping,

00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:58.150
put down the knife.

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.670
Don't come any closer!

00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:59.730
Put down the knife!

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:01.840
Wang Ping.

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:05.150
It's okay.

00:35:05.490 --> 00:35:06.280
It's okay.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.230
What's going on?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.250
Calm down!

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.630
Wang Ping.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:10.110
It's me.

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:11.630
Look at me!

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:12.320
It's me,

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.300
Hu Wenjing.

00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:15.130
It's okay.

00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:16.320
-What happened?
-Nothing.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:16.840
It's fine.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.440
It's okay.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.150
Hu Wenjing.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.630
It's Hu Wenjing.

00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:19.190
Hu Wenjing.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:20.280
Hu Wenjing.

00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.360
It's okay.

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.960
Hu Wenjing.

00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:24.300
It's okay.

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.480
It's okay.

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.280
It's okay, Wang Ping. You're fine.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.000
Hu Wenjing.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.710
I'm here.

00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:30.630
Xiaoya is here.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.920
It's okay now.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.430
Hu Wenjing, don't go!

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:33.110
Sit still.

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.920
It's okay.

00:35:34.570 --> 00:35:35.420
I'm here.

00:35:37.230 --> 00:35:38.160
Come take a look.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.110
What's wrong with her?

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:39.670
I don't know.

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.470
She was like this when I arrived.

00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:43.880
I'll call an ambulance.

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.090
Where does it hurt?

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.590
Is it your heart?

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.070
I'll get you a glass of water.

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.320
There's someone unwell.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:54.190
The address is

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:56.510
125 Lingqiao Street.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:58.800
Okay, please come as fast as possible.

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.730
Okay, thank you.

00:36:03.590 --> 00:36:04.990
The ambulance is coming.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.590
What on earth

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.030
is wrong with you?

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.110
Where does it hurt?

00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:16.110
Someone is playing the piano
under the light.

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:16.760
What?

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.840
Only one family member can go in.

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.570
Did you bring the patient's ID?

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:39.590
I know where it is.

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.360
I'll go get it.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.160
I'll go get it.

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:43.490
It should be in the drawer.

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:58.230
How much of the drug

00:36:58.470 --> 00:36:59.590
is in this candy?

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.300
About 100 micrograms.

00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:11.510
Can you find it?

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.670
Yes.

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.410
Hurry up.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.030
Phone.

00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.280
Here.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:17.790
Okay.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:21.290
-See you later.
-See you at the hospital.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.630
Wenjing.

00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:47.280
Wenjing.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:48.510
I'm here.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:49.840
It's okay.

00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.640
We're on our way to the hospital.

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:52.480
How are you feeling?

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.400
How do you feel?

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.840
I think I'm better.

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:00.710
Feeling a bit better, right?

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:03.110
Can you talk a bit now?

00:38:03.130 --> 00:38:03.970
Yes.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:05.920
Earlier you told me

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.280
you saw your neighbor

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:09.030
playing the piano in the light.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:10.960
Was that a slip of the tongue?

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:12.940
It wasn't a slip of the tongue.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:14.470
I really felt like

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.510
I saw it.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.380
I felt my heart

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:21.710
was racing,

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.280
and I felt a bit dizzy,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:26.030
but in my mind

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.730
these really beautiful images

00:38:34.110 --> 00:38:35.590
kept appearing.

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.280
Before these symptoms started,

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.740
did you take any mushrooms

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
or other fungi?

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:40.660
No.

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.700
We agreed to have lunch together, right?

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:45.400
I've only had two candies

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:46.840
since this morning.

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:48.370
What candy?

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.060
What kind of candy did you eat?

00:38:50.890 --> 00:38:52.090
Just ordinary candy.

00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:55.170
I grabbed some off my brother's desk

00:38:55.170 --> 00:38:56.260
and ate them.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.440
Do you still have
some of these candies at home?

00:38:58.440 --> 00:38:59.900
There should be some left.

00:39:02.570 --> 00:39:03.180
Zhang Yan,

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:04.590
take your team

00:39:04.590 --> 00:39:05.840
and head to this address right away.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:07.100
I'll send it to you now.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.000
Press it

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.190
for five minutes.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.190
Okay.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.110
Thank you, Nurse.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.960
Nurse, when will the results be ready?

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.470
At least an hour and a half.

00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.550
That long?

00:39:27.550 --> 00:39:28.510
Lie down for a while.

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:29.800
I think I'm fine.

00:39:30.040 --> 00:39:30.770
How is it?

00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:31.670
What did the doctor say?

00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:33.070
She just drew some blood.

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.930
Let's wait for the results.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.540
Then lie down for a bit.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.750
I feel much better.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.840
Just lie down.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:41.230
Nurse.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:43.160
What's wrong?

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:45.510
I'm from the County Public Security Bureau's
Criminal Investigation Unit.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.190
I need to ask you a few questions.

00:39:47.190 --> 00:39:48.110
Are you hungry?

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.510
Should I order you some food?

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:51.400
Have you two not eaten yet either?

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:52.070
No.

00:39:52.070 --> 00:39:52.670
We were scared to death.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:53.670
Who could eat?

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.110
I'm actually a bit hungry.

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.840
I'll order some takeout for you.

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.400
Wenjing,

00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:58.440
I'm ordering takeout.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.230
What do you want?

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.000
I won't eat.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.730
I have to go to the Youth Center.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.740
What happened?

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:04.670
I now suspect

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.150
that there was something wrong
with the candies you ate.

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:08.440
What? Were they expired?

00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.510
It's not about expiration.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:11.070
Think about how you felt after eating it.

00:40:11.070 --> 00:40:12.400
Didn't it feel a bit off?

00:40:12.630 --> 00:40:14.760
I seriously suspect it's contraband.

00:40:19.340 --> 00:40:21.350
How could contraband be in my house?

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:23.060
I'm wondering the same thing.

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:23.760
Why would it

00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:25.490
appear on your brother's desk?

00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:26.800
Impossible.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:29.800
Wang An can't have anything
to do with stuff like that.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.280
If that's really the case,

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:32.470
it's terrifying.

00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.310
Whether it's possible or not,

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:35.480
I will definitely find out.

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.920
My colleague will be here soon.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:37.480
I've briefed him.

00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.230
Don't leave her alone here
before he arrives.

00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:40.630
Just stay here for a while.

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:41.280
From now on,

00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.480
this matter must be kept confidential.

00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:44.480
I'm leaving.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:45.230
You guys get some rest.

00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.840
Wenjing,

00:40:48.590 --> 00:40:50.990
this can't have anything
to do with Wang An.

00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.230
I told you

00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:54.000
I'll find out
whether he's involved or not.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.800
I won't falsely accuse him.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.840
Don't worry.

00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:57.710
You know what kind of kid

00:40:57.710 --> 00:40:58.400
he is.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.860
I know. Just get some rest.

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:04.920
Alright, go now.

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:07.520
Take your men to the Youth Center
immediately.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:24.060
