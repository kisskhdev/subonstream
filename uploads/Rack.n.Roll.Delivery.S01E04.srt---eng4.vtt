00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.640
You guys...

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:00.000
Do you know each other?

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:03.880
No.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.200
About what happened today...

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:10.079
Thank you.

00:01:10.879 --> 00:01:12.200
I didn't expect you and...

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.319
Lang Jiu to have such a deep grudge.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.079
But the moment you appeared...

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:18.719
You were so cool.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.040
Truly the Ball King I've admired for ten years.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.640
But why did you change your name?

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:28.159
And grew your hair so long.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:29.680
I didn't even recognize you.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:31.079
But...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The name Hei Ba sounds pretty good too.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.480
You won back then with the Miracle Black Eight.

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:42.359
The competition back then...

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.239
Must have had a hidden story.

00:01:45.519 --> 00:01:46.719
We all believe in you.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.959
How about...

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.280
How about you make a comeback?

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.879
I have many friends in clubs...

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.760
Who can help you.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.480
With your skills...

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.640
You can definitely beat that pervert...

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.120
To a pulp.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.760
I'm leaving now.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.480
Why are you leaving?

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.560
I'm serious.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.400
You don't think my skills are too poor, do you?

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.960
Thank you for your trust.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.319
Yesterday...

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.759
Lang Jiu's club was raided by the police.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.879
So satisfying.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.120
That kind of person...

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.080
Should be taught a lesson.

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:28.919
Did you take the wrong road?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.080
Wrong road?

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.800
Where is this?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.319
This...

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:04.240
No!

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:05.199
Help!

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:06.960
Help!

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.479
Wait a minute.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.400
What's wrong?

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.120
Where is this?

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:30.519
It really is here.

00:04:32.079 --> 00:04:33.399
Isn't this a tourist spot?

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.040
Why come here for an interview?

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:37.279
And confiscate phones too.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.639
Seems it's not just...

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:44.959
As simple as selecting streamers.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.279
Who's there?

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.680
Intruder!

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:49.920
Evacuate all guests.

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:52.319
Sorry, VIP.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.160
Emergency situation.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.360
We'll escort you out first.

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:59.560
Ruining my fun.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.560
Stop!

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.319
Don't run!

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:09.079
Stop, don't run!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.120
Stop! Stop!

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.439
Send a car to chase them, quick!

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.199
Why are you here?

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:29.160
Didn't you pull me up?

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.199
Aren't you supposed to be tough?

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.959
My idol is asking...

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.279
Why are you being chased by security?

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.120
The more you know...

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.160
They're catching up!

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.759
Quick!

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.000
Turn right at the speed bump ahead.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.920
No.

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:41.720
We just went down that road.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.759
It's a dead end.

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.519
Listen to me.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.959
Turn right ahead and get in my car.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.199
Stop all delivery vehicles nearby.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.079
Someone broke in.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.560
Seen enough?

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:33.120
Get out.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.560
Idol.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.759
Let's go.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.079
What happened?

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.240
Have we met today?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.319
Don't look at me like that.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.079
I don't like stand-in romance...

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.319
Nor do I like interfering with couples.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.639
Take your sweetheart...

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.000
And stay away from me.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.040
Go.

00:07:19.399 --> 00:07:21.000
That was really close today.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.519
Say,

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.920
who were those people chasing us?

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
Gangsters.

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:29.959
But isn't Yi Xin the Madam?

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.199
Why didn't she

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:32.920
have her bodyguards take them out?

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:35.639
Or is it that

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.240
everything she did

00:07:42.439 --> 00:07:43.839
was all for you?

00:07:46.519 --> 00:07:47.000
Man,

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.759
you have successfully caught my attention.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.920
Isn't that how it goes in TV dramas?

00:07:57.839 --> 00:07:58.839
Or maybe

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.040
she is doing something dangerous.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.240
What did you say?

00:08:06.439 --> 00:08:07.759
That's how it goes in TV dramas.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:08.759
Not that line.

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.800
She is doing something dangerous.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.839
Right.

00:08:16.399 --> 00:08:17.279
Where are you going?

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.480
Weiwei.

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:28.480
Are you doing something dangerous?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.959
So you pushed me away on purpose?

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.759
Your phone keeps ringing.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:44.720
Are you sure you won't answer it?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.840
Could it be that everything back then wasn't an accident,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.399
but there was a hidden story?

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.559
Who dares to break into Kaye Mountain?

00:08:55.919 --> 00:08:56.840
Go investigate.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:57.440
Al-Al...

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.240
Already checked.

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.200
It might be tourists.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.519
It shouldn't be important.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:03.679
I decide if something is important or not.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.200
Understood, Boss Nan.

00:09:05.399 --> 00:09:06.240
I'll go right away.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.039
Get Cheng Ye to make a comeback soon.

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:10.519
So the group can recover some funds.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.039
Boss Nan, you are brilliant.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.879
Release the news of Cheng Ye making a comeback.

00:09:14.279 --> 00:09:15.080
Those big bosses

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.799
will place bets on him.

00:09:16.879 --> 00:09:17.399
When the time comes,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.759
we can...

00:09:19.039 --> 00:09:20.080
Only when he stands high enough

00:09:20.799 --> 00:09:22.559
can we make him fall hard enough.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.679
I didn't go looking for you,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.840
yet you came knocking on my door yourself.
