Your Highness, watch out!

Your Highness!

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.420
What happened?

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.780
That mute girl is from Qiang State.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.310
She poisoned Her Highness.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.120
Summon the imperial physician!

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.479
No.

Bai.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.210
Do you remember?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.970
When two stars meet,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.370
one is destined to fall.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:56.960
If one of us

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.200
must die

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.630
for the other to live,

doesn't have to be me.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.990
No, you can't.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.280
I've made up my mind.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.970
Stop trying to persuade me.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.390

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.030
Yes.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.930
Let's go.

CEO Dan,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.110
I broke my promise.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900
I don't want to wait for the next life,

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.910

How come I'm fine?

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.870
You...

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:56.930
What did you all do?

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.220
We didn't do anything.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.810
Physician Xiao came

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.170
to check on your pulse.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.960
The poison's effect only lasts a night.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.850
So now,

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.410
you are basically fine.

Flower never intended to kill me.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.399
She only wanted to
threaten me with poison.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.899
It seems so.

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.230
What about His Majesty?

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.720
What did Physician Xiao say?

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.580
His Majesty...

She had poison hidden with her.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.120

I don't blame you.

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.920
We should be blaming those
who gave her orders instead.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.780
They wouldn't even spare a child.

were all killed.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.090

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.340

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.720
Mr. Bei had also passed away.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.180

Your Highness.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.080
My Master said

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.210
he was sure I could help him.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.470
He wouldn't be wrong.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:27.060
I hope so.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.480
Physician Xiao.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.450
General Lin.

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.630
Has there been any new discovery regarding

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.480
the poison Her Highness had sent?

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.480
I applied the poison to a mouse's wound,

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.360
and the wound wouldn't heal
for a long time.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.870
This effect is very similar to the poison

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.510
Tu'er used on his blade before.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:02.910
It's just that the dosage is too low.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.040
I was about to ask where you got it from.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:08.870
The mute girl serving Her Highness

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.480
left this flower before she died.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.140
I wonder...

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.860
if it has anything to do with this poison.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:28.780
It does!

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:30.520
Great.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:32.010
I'll get a painter

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.780
to copy it.

00:11:33.750 --> 00:11:34.870
I'll dig to the ends of the earth

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.700
to find it.

00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.720
General Lin.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.620
I think...

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.980
I've seen this flower before.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.170
I heard you guys found a clue?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:51.450
Physician Xiao said

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:54.000
he saw someone growing
this flower in the flower house.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.550
This might be the key to curing
His Majesty's poison.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:57.080
Found it!

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.130
Found it!

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:07.000
It was originally planted in the ground.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.200
But perhaps the Imperial Medical Bureau
needed to plant other herbs,

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.530
so they moved it to a pot.

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:11.960
That's why we couldn't find it right away.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.390
It matches these dried flowers.

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.520
No mistake about it.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.300
But in this palace,

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.790
who else

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.370
would grow flowers from Qiang State?

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:21.440
It's...

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.360
Consort Xie.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.350
I've loved gardening since I was young.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.240
I saw these in
the Empress Dowager's garden.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.740
These are so rare,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.030
so I thought I'd ask for a few sprigs.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.350
These plants

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.900
were rare tributes from various countries.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.170
Consort Xie,

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.880
you have good taste.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:57.900
Your Highness.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:12:59.440
Physician Xiao,

00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.150
you came just at the right time.

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:02.670
Could you take a look at this flower

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.600
and tell me the best way to plant it?

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:06.780
Be careful.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:09.340
Thick roots,

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:10.890
slender leaves,

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:13.730
and bell-shaped flowers.

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.660
It grows well in damp, miasmic places,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.000
and doesn't seem to be from our Great Xia.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.030
You have a sharp eye, Physician Xiao.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:23.840
These are flowers presented to the Empress Dowager
as tribute from foreign lands.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.500
I remember Consort Xie saying

00:13:26.150 --> 00:13:28.910
that she received this as a reward
from the Empress Dowager.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.110
Now that you mention it, it rings a bell.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:33.250
Before the Empress Dowager died,

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:35.920
she seemed to have made such a gesture.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:41.340
It's exactly the same gesture
Flower made just now.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.760
This is a gesture...

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.240
made by people of Qiang State to
pray for their souls to return home.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.570
The Empress Dowager was from Qiang State?

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:49.700
No wonder.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.430
She hated the late Emperor so much,

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:53.830
yet she spared no cost

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.030
to manipulate the court

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.630
and bring chaos to Great Xia.

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.570
It turns out she was just like Flower,

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:01.370
both pawns of Qiang State.

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.100
Your Highness.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.120
For the method of fighting poison
with poison, which we had discussed,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.450
the missing ingredient

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.400
might be this plant right here.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:19.850
Yong'er.

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:23.450
You really are the chosen one.

00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:26.560
This last hope...

00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:30.560
has been with you all along.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:39.770
Your Highness,

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:41.500
I have replicated it according to
the ancient formula.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.760
You just have to sprinkle it on the wound.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:47.150
Are you confident?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.750
Previously, when His Majesty

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:49.950
was stabbed by Tu'er,

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:52.320
not only did the wound heal,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.730
but his headaches were also relieved.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.790
This method of fighting poison with poison

00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:58.390
should theoretically work,

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:01.120
but no one has actually tried it.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.280
When in doubt between
advancing and retreating,

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.160
one should choose to advance.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.050
He's awake.

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:13.320
Wanyin.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:15.080
I'm here.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:19.550
How are you?

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:23.720
Fine.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:24.360
Thank you.

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:25.670
And you?

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.670
It's been 197 days.

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:44.000
That's half a year.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.200
I wonder how things are outside.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:55.300
Your Highness.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.720
You are...

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:07.109
It's me, Wu Jiadong, Your Highness.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.130
How did you get in?

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.819
Your Highness,

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:16.589
I am incompetent.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.020
The guards here

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:19.190
are incorruptible.

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.690
I waited for half a year,

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:24.020
until chaos broke out outside

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.310
and people's resolve wavered.

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:26.960
Only then could I bribe my way through

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.960
to sneak inside

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.500
and see Your Highness.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.080
Keep your voice down.

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:35.850
Don't you think...

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.880
there are eyes everywhere watching me?

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.210
-Your Highness. You...
-My every move...

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.640
is controlled by him.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.590
Come on.

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.400
Here.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.380
Look at this.

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:57.040
Sometimes...

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.770
the chess piece I place here

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.080
ends up somewhere else.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.520
And...

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.760
the guards at the door,

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:10.000
they never change.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.880
It's as if they have no friends,

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.880
no family,

00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.560
and nothing else to do.

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.480
Their life's mission

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.510
seems to be just guarding me.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:29.830
Sometimes,

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:33.410
in a haze of confusion,

00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.390
I can still hear them
calling me Worthy Lord.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:42.590
It's as if my life

00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:45.140
has different versions.

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.270
One time,

00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:51.830
they hailed 'Long live the Emperor.'

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.260
I managed Great Xia perfectly fine,

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.520
bringing peace and prosperity.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.140
They all called me the true Son of Heaven.

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:09.870
There is an invisible hand in this world,

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.620
and we are all his pawns.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.780
You certainly wouldn't understand,

00:19:22.170 --> 00:19:24.060
because you are a level below me.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:24.730
Yes.

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.970
I'll show you right now.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.920
It's time.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.130
Someone will interrupt us any moment.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.330
The guards are coming.

00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:43.740
I must go.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.590
Interesting.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:55.900
Your Highness,

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:58.350
please take care.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.870
You just have to wait a little longer,

00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:03.600
and you will rise to power again.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.680
I'll take my leave.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.200
Interesting.

00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:22.480
You guys don't seem to be much good.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.950
I've got you!

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.240
I've got you!

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:39.070
Your Majesty,

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.090
Xiahou Bo actually believed it.

00:20:41.150 --> 00:20:42.160
When I left,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.480
he was still shouting that
he is the true...

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.610
the true... true...

00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:47.860
What utter nonsense!

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:51.020
From now on, go see him

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:52.370
every now and then.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:54.060
Tell him

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.340
how chaotic the world outside is.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.340
Make him wait.

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:00.130
As long as he lives,

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.590
I won't hold you accountable.

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:04.310
Thank you, Your Majesty,

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:06.580
for giving me a chance to redeem myself.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:08.090
You may leave.

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:09.910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.440
Speak your mind.

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.980
I don't understand.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.260
Why are you doing this, Your Majesty?

00:21:28.050 --> 00:21:29.380
As long as there is hope,

00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:30.710
one won't seek death.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.400
But Prince Duan committed treason first.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.640
We are still brothers,

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:35.640
actual brothers.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.520
Your Majesty,

00:21:39.870 --> 00:21:41.900
you are truly benevolent.

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:44.090
Don't force tears if you have none.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.800
When did Wanyin leave the palace?

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.060
Why isn't she back yet?

00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.900
Her Highness left only an hour ago.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.200
That's too long. I'll go get her.

00:21:56.350 --> 00:21:56.720
Yes.

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.650
Don't come with me.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.220
Prepare hotpot for me.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.440
We'll have the nine-grid pot tonight.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.370
Yes.

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:09.160
-Stop!
-Slow down.

00:22:09.670 --> 00:22:10.400
Here, Er Lan.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:14.900
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:18.610
Brother Cen.

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:20.280
Because of your Yan millet,

00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.080
Great Xia survived the drought.

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:24.040
Now,

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:25.080
the war in Yan State has been quelled.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.070
[Tomb of Wang Zhao]

00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:27.790
Tu'er has become the Emperor of Yan,

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:28.850
and had even sent a treaty of alliance.

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:29.830
[Tomb of Du Shan]

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:31.720
An era of peace and prosperity
has arrived.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.250
With you here, Brother Cen,

00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:35.680
we will see abundant harvests every year.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.020
Slow down.

00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:38.020
Let's take a walk.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.680
Okay.

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:43.080
-Be careful not to fall.
-Let’s go over there.

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:46.240
Li Yunxi has been watching you
for quite a while now.

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.440
He even asked me about you a few days ago.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.830
Are you trying to set us up,
Your Highness?

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:53.090
I wouldn't go that far.

00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:55.560
What kind of life you want,

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.250
and who you want to be with,

00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:58.600
is all up to you.

00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.610
What's on your mind now?

00:23:05.030 --> 00:23:06.490
Do you still want to leave?

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.720
Now that the imperial examinations
have resumed,

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:11.210
talented people are emerging in court.

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.370
My departure now

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.200
can be seen as a graceful exit.

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.000
Look, look!

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.030
It's just...

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:21.900
I'm just a bit worried about you,
Your Highness.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.590
After all, joint rule by
the emperor and empress

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.320
will inevitably cause gossip.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.790
Your Highness' influence is at its peak,

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:29.590
so no one dares to challenge you.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.680
But from now on, you'll be swamped with
daily affairs and countless tasks,

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.200
and even just a small mistake—

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.400
It doesn't matter if mistakes are made.

00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.530
Achievements belong to Her Highness,

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:44.520
while any minor mistakes are mine.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:46.310
When loyal ministers offer counsel,

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.170
Her Highness will surely listen.

00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.160
But...

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.480
If any treacherous schemers
seek to exploit the situation,

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:53.330
my madness

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.390
can relapse at any time.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.270
I might accidentally

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.400
kill someone in court again.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:01.940
You really know how to play along.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:04.660
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.140
Rise.

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:07.020
Alright.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:08.480
Go back to the carriage and
stay out of the wind.

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.590
We're not done talking yet.

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:10.540
Let me listen in.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:11.760
Go. Stop fussing.

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:15.640
Okay, I'll go find them.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.870
To be honest,

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:29.690
I can't bear to let you go either.

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.000
[Tomb of Wang Zhao]

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.680
Now that Li Yunxi and Yang Duojie

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.190
are doing so well,

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.300
are you willing to lose to them?

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.640
But now,

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:39.450
everyone knows I am a woman,

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:42.070
and there is no precedent
for female officials.

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:43.240
There was never a precedent

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.310
for joint rule by both
the emperor and empress either.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.240
For many things,

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.260
if we don't try,

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.450
how could there be any precedent?

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.040
Er Lan.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:52.610
Precisely because we are women,

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.950
we must remember.

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:56.280
For many things,

00:24:57.550 --> 00:24:59.470
we should be the first to do them,

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:01.280
not the last.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.490
Li Yunxi was wrong about one thing.

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:09.720
He's not the only one in this world

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:10.920
who understands you.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:16.910
With the great ambitions of yours
to make your mark in history,

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:18.970
why hide behind someone else's name?

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:20.780
We women

00:25:21.750 --> 00:25:23.680
can also achieve great things that

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.560
benefit the common people.

00:25:30.390 --> 00:25:31.250
Your Highness.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.300
Go and play.

00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.220
Also,

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.480
I am currently short-handed on my mission

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.030
to establish girls' schools
across the country.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:43.830
In the future,

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.160
little girls like her

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.260
can attend school just like boys.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:48.050
Er Lan.

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.560
What do you think of this offer?

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:52.200
Aren't you tempted?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.980
You are truly wise.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.920
You know right away

00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.960
if it'll work or not.

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:01.750
Of course.

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.880
Did you catch a chill?

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:09.420
Why are your hands so cold?

00:26:15.730 --> 00:26:18.130
Don't frown on such a
beautiful spring day.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.110
Didn't Physician Xiao mention that

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:22.240
the poison in my body

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.770
has been mostly cleared?

00:26:26.130 --> 00:26:27.160
Don't worry.

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:29.880
I will be with you for many, many years.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:33.810
I told you to go back and wait.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:35.810
Couldn't you wait just for a moment?

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:38.650
I'll go back and drink ginger soup.

00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:40.440
That's more like it.

00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:45.720
I don't want to live like that anymore—

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:47.160
alone in the palace,

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.530
living in fear and dread, waiting for you.

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.240
When one hears the woeful tune of
"Breaking the Willow Branch",

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:03.640
who wouldn't feel homesick?

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.200
Wherever you are

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.190
is my home.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.590
Don't say such cheesy pickup lines

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:13.760
from now on.

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.050
I meant in the future.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.550
But today, I suppose I could make myself
listen some more.

00:27:23.550 --> 00:27:24.680
Then I'll continue.

00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:27.420
As for the future,

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.460
let's set a small goal first.

00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:30.900
Let's earn 100 million.

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.000
We'll then find an experienced driver

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.610
to take us

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:35.560
to travel around the world.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:39.270
Your Majesty,

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:40.590
once we leave,

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.160
there's no one left
to play shuttlecock with you.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:44.960
I will miss you all too.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.240
But His Majesty insists on
disbanding the harem.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.570
I tried to persuade him,

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.980
but his mind is made up.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.560
There's nothing I can do.

00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:55.200
We are not blessed with the good fortune

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.020
to serve His Majesty

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.650
and live and die with him.

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:02.720
You really want to live and die
with His Majesty?

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720
Then how about...

00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:05.890
I go plead with His Majesty again?

00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.270
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.800
That's really not necessary,
Your Highness.

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.960
After you leave the palace,

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.790
what do you all want to do?

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.110
Go home first, of course.

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.910
My parents were thrilled to hear
I was coming home.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.830
You still have a home to return to.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.440
As for me,

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.700
I'll just have to find
another man to marry.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.270
What's wrong with getting married?

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:29.780
This time, I'll find someone I like.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:31.870
I want to have a real romance.

00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:34.930
Sister, do you mean

00:28:35.030 --> 00:28:36.780
you never liked His Majesty?

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:43.020
The money His Majesty gave me

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:45.340
is enough to open a shop in the capital.

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.830
I want to sell my rose essence.

00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.440
My secret recipe will
surely make a fortune.

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.350
When the time comes,

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:53.280
all of you must come and support me.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.510
Sure!

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:55.980
Alright.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.840
No matter what you choose,

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.610
I hope that from now on,

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:02.320
you will live a smooth life.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:03.130
All the best!

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:04.400
All the best!

What's wrong?

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.370
Why are you sighing

00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:13.210
out of the blue?

00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:14.760
Are you unhappy?

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:16.940
I'm not unhappy.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.830
I just feel...

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.230
all of this feels unreal.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:23.880
It's because all of this

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.690
is happening inside a book?

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.130
I was thinking,

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.760
when you entered this world,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.780
it was already on 'hell mode'.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.640
You were forced to fight for survival.

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.920
As your only peer,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.340
I naturally became your ally.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.260
Us coming together

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.640
seems inevitable.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.770
I know it's pointless to dwell on this,

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.810
but sometimes I can't help but wonder,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.720
what if we weren't in this book?

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:57.180
If we weren't in this book,

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.350
by 2026,

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.410
I would have been working for a few years.

00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:07.010
We probably would have met on the subway.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:08.730
What?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.500
After work one day,

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:16.050
I was scrolling through my phone
on the subway.

00:33:16.050 --> 00:33:17.050
Suddenly, I heard

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.700
someone next to me laughing out loud.

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:21.580
I looked up,

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.480
and saw she was also on her phone.

00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:25.960
I took a closer look,

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.200
and realized she was quite cute.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:34.110
She definitely doesn't like being watched.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:34.830
Maybe...

00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.210
she'd even look up to glare at you,

00:33:37.750 --> 00:33:38.680
only to realize,

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.560
it's a good-looking guy.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:41.830
So...

00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:43.950
she'd secretly forgive you.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.860
Then I'd push my luck.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.260
I'd ask for her number.

00:33:50.790 --> 00:33:52.050
Would she give it to me?

00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:54.920
That's hard to say.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:58.310
Then I would...

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.020
What are you doing?

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.500
Please?

00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:08.429
I'm not a weirdo.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:10.510
Just give it to me.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:12.219
Okay, okay.

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.320
Great!

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:15.800
Great!

00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:20.980
Then I'd start talking to her
about novels,

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:22.429
and ask her to the movies.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.270
And then,

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.280
we'd eat at

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.420
the top ten hotpot places in the city.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.949
Our relationship

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:31.719
would grow more in sync
with each passing day.

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:35.550
After that,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.960
I'd send her flowers every day.

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.380
Bunch after bunch.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.480
I'd send lots of flowers.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:56.179
How long can I hold out?

00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.950
Three months?

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:01.440
Four months?

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:03.960
Or half a year?

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:07.480
On the way home one day,

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.080
as I clutched the ring box tightly
in my pocket,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.170
I'd tell her,

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:15.230
I can't imagine

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:18.280
the rest of my life without you.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:24.280
Then I'd secretly watch her reaction.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.170
If she doesn't respond,

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:29.650
then I'll...

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:31.840
just wait a bit longer.

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.570
Impossible.

00:35:33.230 --> 00:35:34.890
Are you that timid of a person?

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:36.340
I was afraid she wouldn't agree.

who is to attend to you today,
