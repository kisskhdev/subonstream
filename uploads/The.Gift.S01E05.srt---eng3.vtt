WEBVTT

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.400
Fine. Babe, then.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.480
Yes, babe.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.080
Hold it sweetly, or she won't believe it.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.720
Okay. Let's go.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.520
Thank you

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.240
for coming to introduce yourself formally.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.920
Babe.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.000
Explain our relationship to Grandma.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.680
Okay, baby.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.160
Honey.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.160
Yes, babe.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.000
My girlfriend, Kluay is…

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.520
She likes to joke around, Grandma.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.680
Yes, babe.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.240
Did you talk to me?

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.480
No, Grandma. She's talking to me. But,

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.840
it's just… her face angle was a bit off.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.080
She was supposed to look here.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.840
Here, babe.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.360
I would like to apologize to you again,
Mrs. Wanee, for not coming earlier.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.360
Actually, Warat invited me
several times already.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.520
But we just finally found time
that matched.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.800
That's right, Grandma.
We never meant to hide anything from you.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.000
Since you're both sitting here now,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.040
why bring up the past? There's no point.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.680
Actually,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.760
I do find you quite likable.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.920
The first time we met at the hotel,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.160
you remember, right?

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.760
I do.

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:20.959
After that day, I was contacted
by Mr. Supol to take on the job here.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.400
I liked your landscaping work
at the hotel,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.240
so I passed your card to Supol.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.320
But I didn't expect your status
to change this fast.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.880
Well then, I'll take this
as a good thing for our family.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.800
Because normally, Warat never
brings any woman for me to consider.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.800
You're the first.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.480
So, welcome.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.360
Thank you very much.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.000
When I invited you
to continue doing projects for the mall,

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.520
I did a brief background check on you.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.720
I heard that

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.520
you tend to leave jobs often
because people oppose you

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.200
over your ability to see spirits.

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.760
Is that true?

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.240
Oh.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.440
Yes, it is.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.680
When you say it's true,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.640
do you mean the opposition is real,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.880
or that you really see spirits?

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.200
Both.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.640
Is that why
you and him get along so easily?

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.280
Because you both believe
in the supernatural?

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.400
That could be, Grandma.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.160
But the reason I chose to be with Kluay

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.920
is because she's a good woman,
kind-hearted and always helps others.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.360
I've never met any woman like her before.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.160
And what about your home?
Where do you live?

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.200
Who are your parents?

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.400
-Uh, I…
-Kluay has a mother.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.800
She runs her own business.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.160
She has one younger sister.
There are three of them in the family.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.560
Um.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.840
Her sister works at our mall too.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.160
Hm?

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:24.560
Hey.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.800
Is something bothering you?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.520
Good. Now you know.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.880
Why did you hide the fact
that I'm an orphan from Mrs. Wanee?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.120
Hey, I did it

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.920
because I wanted you and Grandma
to get along, so nothing gets in the way.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.240
So our work would go smoothly.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.080
Oh.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.840
So you only care about work, is that it?

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.560
No, Kluay. I know my grandma well.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.040
There's no way you'd win her over,
no matter what,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.880
if you and she live in different worlds.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.280
Different worlds?

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.760
Do you mean the world of the rich

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.240
and the poor,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:06.240
the upper class and the lower class?

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.160
Right?

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:10.880
Mr. Warat.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.640
You're misunderstanding things a lot.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.720
I've never been ashamed
of being an orphan.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.360
And I don't think growing up
in an orphanage

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.520
is something I need to hide from anyone.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.080
-Kluay, I…
-I'm just an ordinary person.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.880
Yes. I may not have had the same
opportunities as people with parents,

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.720
but I can create my own.

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:35.120
And I've always believed
that we're all people.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.320
That's equality.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.360
No one is above or below anyone else.

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.640
Kluay.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.320
What I did was to protect you.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.760
It was actually demeaning, Mr. Warat.

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.920
Please understand that.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.200
Wait.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:50.520
Kluay, come talk to me.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.240
Supol,

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.760
pick me up early tomorrow.

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.680
‎JIRASIN, FATHER (DECEASED),
‎MOTHER (DECEASED), MS. PRAEWILAI (?)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.240
And what about your home?
Where do you live?

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.760
Who are your parents?

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.240
Kluay, what I did was to protect you.

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.960
If I'd known it'd turn into this trouble,
I shouldn't have helped you.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.320
I… I mean Mr. Warat.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.200
I'm still helping you.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.960
I'm still helping you.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:42.840
I mean Mr. Warat.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.680
Kluay, are you busy?

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.920
Uh.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.920
What is it, Som?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.440
Why are you making that face?

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:10.280
You startled me, that's all.
You showed up without a sound.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:12.960
Det asked me to give you this.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.080
Som, I haven't talked
to Det in a long time.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.720
-I don't want to read it.
-Hey, why not?

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.000
I already took it.

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.880
-Then you should read it.
-Hey.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.600
Hey. Next time, ask me first.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.080
When would I even get the chance to ask?

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.120
Just read it. I feel bad for the uncle.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.240
-Uncle?
-Yeah.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.840
It suits him perfectly.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.160
The longer Det's been with Ameena,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.360
the worse he's getting day by day.
He looks older, more worn out every day.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.120
He must be carrying a lot of misery.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.480
Serves him right.

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:52.360
He's pitiful. Don't say that about him.

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.680
Sure. Pity yourself first.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.160
I heard you fought with Mr. Warat.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.760
-How did you know?
-Daddy told me.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.400
Daddy?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.360
It's Arnon.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.440
I just call him that as a joke.
It's nothing.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.400
I'm going. I still have work to deliver.

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.120
-Is it really just a joke?
-Yeah.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.360
Ugh.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:18.880
You little troublemaker.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.240
Mr. Arnon and Sompaen?

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.480
Kluay, Som,

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.160
it's a day off.
Why aren't you resting at home?

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:46.640
You could let the kids handle this.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.840
It's fine, Mom.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.480
I wanted to come
eat something good here too.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.240
-Mm.
-If I stay home, I'll probably have to eat

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.680
Kluay's cooking again.

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.240
Hey, what's wrong with my cooking?

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.560
Every time I cook, you eat everything.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.440
-Uh, Mom, I'll take this to wash.
-Alright.

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.840
-Thanks, dear.
-Go ahead.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:12.880
I'll dedicate the merit for "her" too.

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.360
Thank you, Mom.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.640
-Hey, troublemaker, come with me.
-Huh? Me too?

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.880
Come help me wash it.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.880
Why are there so many things today?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.520
Someone brought them over
this morning, Mama Toi.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.760
And later on,

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.560
there'll be snacks
and ice cream coming too.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.960
Mm. There.

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.000
Is that the car?

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.680
Oh, yes, that should be it.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.600
Hello.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.800
It's you.

00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.520
Mm.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.720
We met at the temple before.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.720
Yes. I have to…

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.680
thank you so, so much.

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:08.960
I was just asking them earlier
who the donor was.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:10.880
I saw everything
arrive early this morning.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.520
My name is Wanee Vanich.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.440
Mrs. Wanee.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.400
I run Vanich Mall.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.840
I'm Kluay's mother.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.600
Kluay Boonsita,
the one who did the landscape architecture

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.840
for the Vanich family.

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.640
It's a pleasure to meet you again.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.040
You must be
Mama Toi, the founder here, right?

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.960
Yes, but you don't have to
call me Mama Toi.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.040
Mom, can we put the ice cream
they're donating into these cups?

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.280
She's been donating things for the kids
since early this morning.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.160
Hello.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.480
Uh, thank you so very much.

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.320
So this must be the place
that Rat told me about

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.120
that your mother runs a private business.

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.760
Huh? What is she talking about?

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.040
Well then, please let me
show you around the place.

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.720
The topic of being an orphan
is very sensitive.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.920
Exactly.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.560
That's why I had to protect her.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.200
And I ended up getting scolded.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.400
What's right for us
might be wrong for them.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.280
I still think I didn't do anything wrong.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.080
You know
what my grandma is like, don't you?

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.960
If I had said that Kluay has no parents,

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.480
that she grew up in an orphanage,

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.520
man, I swear…

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.800
But it is the truth.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.360
I know the truth is best,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.720
but not in this case. You know it too.

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:11.240
We work together.

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.560
I've argued with you
for years and never won once.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.480
But what about you?
How are you going to make up with her?

00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:20.040
Me? Go make up with her?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.840
Are you crazy? I didn't do anything wrong.

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.040
BUILDING ONE, OFFICE, ADMIN OFFICE,
BUILDING TWO, SEEDBED

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:31.880
That Kluayhom.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.520
Just a little thing and she's sulking.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.880
Fine then.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.800
Just don't throw it back in my face.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.360
Let me be honest with you, Mrs. Wanee.

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:53.800
I never intended to hide my background.

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.560
But yesterday…

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.440
That must have been Warat.

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.680
I understand my grandson.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.800
Warat was afraid you wouldn't accept me.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.160
Because you're an orphan?

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.600
Oh, Warat…

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.920
Why do you think so little
of your own grandmother?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.440
To be honest,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:29.040
I don't really care
about what family you come from.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.800
I was just making conversation.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.800
Besides, whether you and Warat

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.080
will last long or not is still unknown.

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.920
A month, a year,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.320
or maybe you'll break up soon enough.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.880
So I don't see why I should concern myself
with your background at all.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.960
It's a waste of my time.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.640
I understand.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.680
But bear this in mind,

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.000
when two people are to be together,

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.160
if their upbringing
and family environment are too different,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.320
I can tell you it's difficult
to survive together.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.600
Even though we're all human beings?

00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:13.640
What you're saying is abstract.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.320
What I'm saying is concrete.

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.720
It can be measured.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.240
Measured?

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.360
Except for the value
of being human, right?

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.640
Well.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.080
You'll understand someday
and come to accept it.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.080
But I believe Rat

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:37.000
will end up with a woman who suits him,
someone complete in every way.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.360
And I'm certain that Rat

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:44.400
would never take a woman
with an unknown background

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.080
to be my granddaughter-in-law.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.680
I hope you get what you wish for.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.000
A lowly woman like you
will never be comparable to anyone else.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.440
Don't sit there squeezing out tears.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.240
It's you

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.800
who let yourself get pregnant.

00:17:04.319 --> 00:17:05.680
Trying to trap him?

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.960
Such shallow tricks.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.240
Do you think I'm stupid,
that I can't see through you?

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.960
Huh, you venomous snake?

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.280
I'll say this one last time.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:16.839
Until the day I die,

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.160
I will never accept you

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.680
as an in-law of the Vanich family.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.240
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.120
I think

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.560
we should go that way instead.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.400
Kluay. Kluay!

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.760
Warat?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.280
Grandma.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.080
Hello, Wi.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.640
It's Det, Detbodin.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:59.880
I remember. No need to introduce yourself.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.200
What's so urgent?

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:03.320
Um…

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.400
Do you have Kluay's number?

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:08.120
Kluay? Kluay Boonsita?

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.680
Yes, yes. Well…

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.960
I want you to call her for me

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:15.960
to come see me, if possible.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.480
I have something I want to talk about.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.240
Don't worry, Mom.

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.440
Kluay is feeling a bit better now.
I had her rest.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.000
Kluay, are you okay?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.600
Mr. Warat.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:41.760
Kluay.

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.680
Where's Mrs. Wanee?

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.560
Grandma walked you back,
but she's already left.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:58.200
Som, go help Mom. I'm feeling better now.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.200
Are you sure?

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:03.000
Mm. Go.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.040
I need to talk to Mr. Warat.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.000
Please don't let anything happen
to my sister again.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.920
Hey.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.120
Are you okay? This time, it seems

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.320
worse than usual.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.480
Yes. It's getting
more frightening, Mr. Warat.

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.040
I don't know how much longer
I'll be able to stay and help you.

00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.200
It's okay.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.840
If I keep forcing you to help
despite the danger you're in,

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.040
then I'd be a terrible person.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960
Well…

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.160
I saw…

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.040
I saw your grandmother
scolding Ms. Mysterious.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.880
Your grandmother

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.240
doesn't want Ms. Mysterious
to become an in-law of the Vanich.

00:20:06.040 --> 00:20:07.680
That wedding image…

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:09.080
Yes.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.960
And Ms. Mysterious was pregnant too.

00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:14.680
Well…

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:17.440
I heard a child's sound.

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.160
The sound of a child's ankle bells.

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.600
That sound
was extremely distressing to me.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.880
-Hey, are you okay?
-Ow…

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.520
Should we go see a doctor?

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.240
No, I don't want to see a doctor.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.240
But take me to your house right now.

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.720
My house?

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.160
All the answers are there.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.680
Especially your grandma's room.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.120
I need to end this as quickly as possible.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.000
I don't know how much time I have left.

00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:53.400
You want to go now?
Do you know what time it is?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.240
Will there even be enough time?

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:58.320
I'll stay there until this is over.

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.520
You're going to stay with me?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.080
Yes. As your girlfriend.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.560
I think it's strange.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.320
Kluay looked at me and just collapsed.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.800
What do you think it was, Supol?

00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:19.440
That's what I'm wondering too, ma'am.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.440
Last time,
Ms. Kluay fainted at rose arbor house

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.040
for no apparent reason as well.

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.040
I don't know.

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:29.360
Part of me adores her.

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.920
But another part of me
feels uneasy I can't quite explain it.

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.280
And Toi, her mother, is strange too.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.720
Ever since we met at the temple.

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.040
Yes, ma'am.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.120
Last time I saw her staring at you
without looking away at all.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.520
Or maybe…

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.360
I should cut this off at the root.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.960
Force the two of them
to break up right now

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.480
and end this once and for all.

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:06.120
With the utmost respect, ma'am,
I'm afraid it won't be that easy.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:10.480
From what I can see,
Mr. Warat is very attentive to Ms. Kluay.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.400
We can't let this go on.

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.720
Kluay faints so often.
It really worries me.

00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.560
How are we going to convince her
to go see a doctor, Mom?

00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.160
Every time she wakes up,
she seems perfectly normal,

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.600
like nothing ever happened.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.640
Kluay isn't stubborn with me.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.160
If I ask her gently,
she'll probably agree.

00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.920
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.880
Earlier,

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.920
I was busy taking care of Kluay,

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.680
so I didn't greet you properly.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.760
It's fine.

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.760
Even if your hands greet me,
if your heart doesn't respect me,

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.840
greeting or not, it's all the same.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.520
But, thank you, anyway,

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.960
for bringing the plant with you.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:06.840
The plant didn't do anything wrong.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:10.320
Leaving it on the ground to die
would be pitiful.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:13.080
-So take it back.
-Oh.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.760
Mr. Warat brought it for Kluay, Mom.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.200
I'll put it in a new pot later.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.160
Thank you.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.680
Is Kluay feeling better now?

00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.360
-Mm.
-She's completely fine now, Mom.

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.200
Just like every time,
falls on her own, gets up on her own.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.160
Tough as ever.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.120
And where are you going now?

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.640
You just recovered, why not rest a bit?

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.280
I'm going to stay at Mr. Warat's house.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.960
Stay at Mr. Warat's house?

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.400
Mm.

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.880
I don't know how much strength
I'll have left to help Ms. Mysterious.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.000
I need to finish this as soon as possible.

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.080
Besides,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.760
Ms. Mysterious is really pitiful too.

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.040
Staying overnight at someone else's house,

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.200
does that really help that much?

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.360
It does.

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.480
Because the place with
the best information is the Vanich house.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:16.000
Ms. Mysterious

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.360
is definitely connected
to the Vanich family.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.120
Mom.

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.600
Trust me, okay?

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.960
I know my daughter
isn't being reckless. I'm just worried.

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.800
But I think if you're worried about Kluay,

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.280
you also need to let her
solve her own problems.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:42.040
Don't worry, Kluay.

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.040
-I'll take care of Mom and the kids here.
-Mm.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.640
Thank you, Som.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.760
-Hey, hey, don't thank each other yet.
-Hm.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.840
I haven't given you permission.
Just wait, you two sisters.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.520
Ah. Mm.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:56.720
Don't worry, ma'am.

00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:58.080
I'll take good care of Kluay

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.520
and finish everything
as quickly as possible.

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.720
Just take good care of each other.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:13.680
Keep us updated, okay?

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:20.320
Yes, Mom.

00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.040
Kluay isn't going far at all.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.640
You can stop worrying now.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.560
Did you forget

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:47.880
you still have another beautiful,
sweet, and lovely daughter here?

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:49.680
I'll get jealous, you know.

00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.800
I'm really worried.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.040
Part of me wants Kluay to be free from…

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.120
The spirits that keep asking for help?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.640
Yes.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.560
But another part of me worries

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.120
because she's been
getting much worse lately.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.080
And if this time she…

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:11.360
Stop it, Mom.

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.840
Did you forget
what you taught Kluay and me?

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.560
To think only good things

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.440
if we want good things to happen.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.880
You reap what you think.
I remember it clearly.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.120
How about this?

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.640
Tomorrow, your beautiful daughter

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.120
will take you
to see Grandpa at the temple?

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.720
If you have any problems or questions,

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:38.200
just ask him. He has all the answers.

00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.680
Don't overthink it.
I'm going to shower now.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.520
This child survived like a miracle.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.960
It seems like a staged murder.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.440
It's probably not, dear.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.640
Let's just hope it was
a simple traffic accident.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.000
Poor thing.

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:14.320
Both parents died.

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.040
At least you survived.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.360
The burned car had a fake license plate.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.520
Even the chassis number was forged.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.320
Dear,

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.760
are you still investigating her case?

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.720
It's our responsibility, dear,

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.520
to gather as much info
about the child as possible.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:33.680
Listening to you talk about it
makes me uneasy.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.640
Leave it to the police.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.280
If they find out who she really is,

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.360
they'll inform us themselves.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.320
Oh.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.760
-Dear.
-Hm?

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.160
This was found with her.

00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:00.520
Is it really time
to return Kluay's amulet, dear?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.160
I'm really worried about our daughter.

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:42.520
Stop staring at me like that, Wichan.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.160
Fine, fine.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.360
From now on,

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.600
I won't stop
your son from dating Kluay anymore.

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.840
Ma'am, Mr. Warat…

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.480
What is it? What's wrong with Warat?

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.880
Honey, hang in there a bit.

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.360
Slowly, okay?

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:19.160
Hey, I just twisted my ankle.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.840
It's not like my leg got chopped off.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:24.400
Ugh, why are you making me
put on such a show?

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:26.520
Grandma already knows we're dating.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:28.920
Didn't you say it yourself

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.120
that we have to make her agree
to let you stay in this house?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.680
We need to make it look natural that you
are really worried about me. Okay?

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:38.000
Well, I am worried.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.600
You don't know how to act, do you?

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.040
It has to be like this.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.880
Babe,

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.600
take care of yourself, babe. Relax, babe.

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:48.040
I'll look after you, babe.

00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.640
-They're here. Hurry.
-Mm.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.080
Warat.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.120
-Warat.
-Babe.

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.360
Mm.

00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.240
Hello.

00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:03.160
What happened?

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.920
Why are you like this?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.840
Oh.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.520
Warat took me to the hospital.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.440
But he slipped
and got sideswiped by a motorcycle.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.800
-Why didn't you call and tell me?
-Ow.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:17.200
Rat, why didn't you tell me?

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.520
I'm fine, Grandma.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:21.200
Just a twisted ankle.

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.280
Nothing broken or fractured.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.680
So it has to get worse than this
before I get to know what happens to you?

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.960
Don't do this again.

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.000
No matter how serious or minor it is,
you must let me know.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.080
Alright.

00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:36.840
And you? Are you fully better now?

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.720
Thank you for bringing Rat home,

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.600
even though you're still unwell yourself.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.280
Uh, Grandma,

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.280
she didn't just bring me home.

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.560
She's going to stay with me for a while.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:53.960
Right, babe?

00:30:58.080 --> 00:30:59.760
Yes.

00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.960
Since Warat got hurt because of me,

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.120
I want to take responsibility
as best as I can.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.920
And the doctor said

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.640
he shouldn't put
too much weight on his foot.

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.800
If I'm here to take care of him,

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.320
he might recover faster.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400
There are plenty of people here.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:21.840
Besides,

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:24.880
I can hire a nurse to look after Rat.

00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.920
You should go back home.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Don't make your mother worry any more.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.120
When you fainted,

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.040
she was already terribly shaken.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.640
Oh, about that,

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.800
I already asked my mom for permission.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.720
And we all agreed

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.480
that I should stay here
to take care of Warat.

00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.600
Grandma,

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.080
I want Kluay to stay with me too.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.920
She's not an outsider.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.640
She's my girlfriend, right, babe?

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.400
Ow, babe, it hurts so much.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.840
Slowly.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.720
Slowly.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.560
Babe, walk slowly.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:21.880
Strange.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.800
Why did Grandma agree so easily this time?

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.480
This counts as easy?

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.480
At first,

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.440
I thought I'd have to sneak you in here.

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.800
But Mrs. Wanee
does seem to have a softer side.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.480
Nonsense. No way.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:42.280
That just means you don't
really know your grandmother.

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.520
Whatever.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.960
In the end,

00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:48.280
you're still here as my girlfriend.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.720
Can you not say that too often?

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:54.880
The more I hear it, the guiltier I feel.

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:57.520
We have to lie about being a couple,

00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:00.040
and lie about your injury

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.680
and have to put this cast on.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.520
If you're only feeling bad now,

00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.120
it's pointless. It's too late.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:09.800
Let's think about what to do next.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.880
Alright.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.320
You said you wanted me
to go into Grandma's room

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:24.520
to look for some information.

00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:27.160
What do you want me to do?

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.240
That was before you mentioned
your father's study.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:33.040
Now I'm more interested in that room.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:36.240
I think, maybe

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.680
we might get complete information there

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.160
without even entering Mrs. Wanee's room.

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.880
Alright, I agree.

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.680
Do you have paper and a pen?

00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:52.360
I want a detailed floor plan
of this place.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.240
Oh, okay.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.160
Where is it? I'll go get it myself.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.720
Over there?

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.720
Put it down now.

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:06.080
I didn't mean to be disrespectful.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:09.360
I'm just familiar
with bracelets like this.

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.120
Did you see something?

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.360
No, but I heard something.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:19.080
I heard the sound
of a child's anklet bells,

00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.080
the same kind of sign
I sensed when I was with Mrs. Wanee.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.520
Grandma scolded Ms. Mysterious

00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.440
and blocked her from becoming
a Vanich daughter-in-law.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.320
Yes.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.880
You said Ms. Mysterious was pregnant,

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.080
and you heard children's voices,

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.560
and

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.320
anklet bells.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.840
How did you get this bracelet?

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:48.880
I've had it with me since I was a child.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.400
But your grandmother insists

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.280
that the woman in the wedding photo
with your father

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.920
isn't your mother, right?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.120
She's always insisted on that.

00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.880
And

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.720
you still insist
that this anklet belongs to you?

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.000
WARAT

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.880
"Warat."

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.960
Alright.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.640
I think you're on the right track.

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.960
At least now that you hear these bells,
you know where they are.

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.920
I don't think we need
the paper and pen anymore.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.160
Let's hurry to your father's study.

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.560
I feel like something
is waiting for me there.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:40.800
When we get to your father's study…

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.440
Mr. Warat.

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.280
You still have the nerve to laugh?
Help me.

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.920
-Ow.
-Leaving you there might be a good idea.

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.520
Hey.

00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:05.920
Just kidding.

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.840
You like watching this show too?

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.120
You never seem interested.

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.000
Not really.

00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.320
I just leave it on.
I'm not paying attention.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.720
Well, has Sin still not come back?

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:42.160
I haven't seen him.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.520
Normally, when Sin goes somewhere,

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.680
he never tells me anyway.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.600
Why?

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.040
Why are you suddenly asking about Sin?

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.160
No reason.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:55.760
Just asking.

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.480
This is my father's study.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.440
And now,

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:11.600
Grandma has allowed me to use this room.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.080
Do you see anything?

00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.600
Oh…

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:27.320
I feel strangely familiar with this room.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:10.200
We've never even met each other,
why did you slap me?

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.400
Look at you,

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.960
soaked exactly like
what you did to me the other day.

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.760
This woman has a lot of enemies.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.880
You shouldn't continue with her.

00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.720
She's the only woman I'm going to be with.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:25.520
If Sin keeps
getting in the way like this, maybe

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.760
I'll have to tell Warat the whole truth.

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.440
What I want most in life

00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:33.440
is the downfall of the Vanich family.

00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:36.080
And if I don't let you do that?

00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.240
NEXT EPISODE
