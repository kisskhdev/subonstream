00:01:19.088 --> 00:01:21.120
Hyun Jin!

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.666
- You okay?
- Yoon Seong...

00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:27.417
Who are you?

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:29.987
What are you doing in her house?

00:01:30.575 --> 00:01:32.548
Are you okay?

00:01:32.548 --> 00:01:34.465
- I'm so sorry.
- What is this?

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:36.136
What the hell are you doing in her house?

00:01:36.136 --> 00:01:37.565
Well...

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:39.817
I was just...

00:01:39.817 --> 00:01:41.993
I was going to wait outside,

00:01:41.993 --> 00:01:43.537
but the door was open, so...

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:44.579
I mean...

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.388
I'm really sorry if I startled you.

00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:47.700
Save it.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.101
You can explain at the police station.

00:01:49.101 --> 00:01:51.186
Sun Woo Jin.

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:53.679
Is this...

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.725
Is this Woo Jin's house?

00:01:57.725 --> 00:01:59.818
How do you know

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:02.567
my brother-in-law's name?

00:02:02.567 --> 00:02:04.512
Brother-in-law?

[Temporary Helper]

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:12.225
Pick up the phone, please.

00:02:12.225 --> 00:02:14.310
The number you're trying to reach is not...

00:02:21.554 --> 00:02:23.597
I'm...

00:02:24.372 --> 00:02:26.904
Woo Jin's father.

00:02:47.934 --> 00:02:49.898
Where's Hyun Jin?

00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:55.753
Are you okay?

00:02:55.753 --> 00:02:58.373
What happened? You're not hurt, huh?

00:02:58.373 --> 00:03:00.189
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.801
Then why didn't you answer your phone?
I was worried sick.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.380
Who are you?

00:03:16.162 --> 00:03:19.006
Are you... Tae Hyung?

00:03:30.505 --> 00:03:32.919
Oh, it's obvious.

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.218
It's really you, Tae Hyung.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:38.917
It really is...

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.404
Who are you, exactly?

00:03:43.725 --> 00:03:46.118
He says he's your father.

00:03:58.076 --> 00:04:00.029
I'm sorry.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:05.519
I came too late.

00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:10.143
I'm so sorry, Tae Hyung...

00:04:17.435 --> 00:04:18.980
Are you sure you're okay?

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.977
I'm fine.

00:04:19.977 --> 00:04:21.966
It wasn't a big deal.

00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:24.520
I'm really okay, so you should get going.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.355
There was a break-in.
How is that not a big deal?

00:04:27.355 --> 00:04:29.634
I spoke to the police earlier.

00:04:29.634 --> 00:04:33.259
If anything's missing,
they want you to call right away.

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:35.053
Okay.

00:04:35.053 --> 00:04:38.569
Thank you so much today.

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.382
No problem.

00:04:40.382 --> 00:04:42.563
By the way, where's Woo Joo?

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:47.013
Downstairs. I'll bring him up on my way in.

00:04:47.013 --> 00:04:49.212
They haven't caught the thief yet.

00:04:49.212 --> 00:04:51.238
I don't like

00:04:51.238 --> 00:04:52.993
leaving you alone.

00:04:52.993 --> 00:04:55.126
I'm really okay.

00:04:55.126 --> 00:04:58.175
It's late. You should go.

00:05:00.297 --> 00:05:03.790
Call me if anything happens.

00:05:04.525 --> 00:05:06.383
I will.

00:05:08.805 --> 00:05:11.477
Woo Jin...

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.445
God...

00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:17.250
It's all my fault. All of it.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.306
Because of money...

00:05:20.306 --> 00:05:22.526
My fault.

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:25.539
I left you kids behind...

00:05:35.895 --> 00:05:38.942
It's been a long time.

00:05:42.692 --> 00:05:45.035
Have you been doing okay?

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.400
You must have resented me a lot.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.024
I don't know.

00:05:59.447 --> 00:06:02.360
I wasn't exactly waiting for you.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.216
Tae Hyung, I...

00:06:04.216 --> 00:06:06.282
So,

00:06:07.468 --> 00:06:09.836
what do you want?

00:06:09.836 --> 00:06:10.875
What?

00:06:10.875 --> 00:06:13.922
Like you said, it's been a long time.

00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:18.577
You didn't just show up like this
without a reason. Right?

00:06:18.577 --> 00:06:21.181
A reason? No.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:23.360
It's not like that.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:25.197
I just wanted to see how you've been.

00:06:25.197 --> 00:06:26.993
That's enough.

00:06:26.993 --> 00:06:30.637
It's not like we can pick up where we left off.

00:06:30.637 --> 00:06:32.800
If you're done talking,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.120
please leave.

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.871
Okay.

00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:42.771
I understand how you feel, Tae Hyung.

00:06:44.198 --> 00:06:46.750
It's late,

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:50.218
so I'll go.

00:07:13.988 --> 00:07:16.807
[Episode 7]
What is going on? A break-in?

00:07:16.807 --> 00:07:19.378
I already called the police.

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:22.038
Hopefully they catch him soon.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.176
Everything feels so chaotic right now.

00:07:25.176 --> 00:07:28.562
My heart's still racing.
You must've been really scared.

00:07:28.562 --> 00:07:30.008
Thank you for checking on me.

00:07:30.008 --> 00:07:31.693
You should get some rest.

00:07:31.693 --> 00:07:34.061
Woo Joo, let's go. Say bye.

00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:35.923
Bye. Get some rest.

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:37.383
- You too.
- Okay.

00:07:46.578 --> 00:07:48.068
Did you have fun?

00:07:54.511 --> 00:07:56.321
Tae Hyung.

00:07:56.321 --> 00:07:58.279
You okay?

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.039
Of course.

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:01.509
Are you okay?

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:04.200
You must've been shaken up.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.627
I'm alright.

00:08:05.627 --> 00:08:09.735
If anyone was more shocked, it was you.

00:08:09.735 --> 00:08:12.275
Did you finish this?

00:08:21.643 --> 00:08:23.154
Come here.

00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:25.142
- Sit.
- What?

00:08:28.529 --> 00:08:29.654
Let me see your hand.

00:08:29.654 --> 00:08:31.152
My hand?

00:08:31.152 --> 00:08:32.872
Why?

00:08:32.872 --> 00:08:35.745
When did I get hurt?

00:08:37.181 --> 00:08:39.370
I must've scraped it when I fell earlier.

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.547
Scraped it? You're bleeding.

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:45.124
Come here.

00:08:46.376 --> 00:08:48.362
I'm fine.

00:08:50.638 --> 00:08:53.872
I'm sorry. This happened because of me.

00:09:00.364 --> 00:09:02.316
You must've been scared.

00:09:02.316 --> 00:09:05.478
Some stranger just walked in...

00:09:07.838 --> 00:09:10.639
Why are you apologizing?

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:13.093
You've got enough on your mind.

00:09:13.093 --> 00:09:15.319
Don't worry about me.

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:18.685
It's not that.

00:09:18.685 --> 00:09:20.908
I've lived longer without him

00:09:20.908 --> 00:09:23.286
than with him.

00:09:25.477 --> 00:09:27.558
And honestly,

00:09:27.558 --> 00:09:29.251
I barely remember him.

00:09:29.251 --> 00:09:31.095
He's practically a stranger.

00:09:31.095 --> 00:09:34.395
Come on. He's not just some stranger.

00:09:35.736 --> 00:09:37.501
Anyway,

00:09:37.501 --> 00:09:39.814
I'm sorry I was late.

00:09:40.631 --> 00:09:43.100
I should've gotten here sooner.

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.836
Be careful. Don't get hurt.

00:09:54.235 --> 00:09:55.854
Oh no. What do we do?

00:09:55.854 --> 00:09:57.568
What do we do?

00:09:57.568 --> 00:09:59.029
Hey.

00:09:59.029 --> 00:10:00.563
- Where's your dad?
- I don't know.

00:10:00.563 --> 00:10:03.022
Do you have any idea how much money he took?

00:10:03.022 --> 00:10:05.788
- Where did he go?
- I don't know where he is.

00:10:05.788 --> 00:10:07.248
Where did he go?

00:10:07.248 --> 00:10:08.701
Stop lying. Where is he?

00:10:08.701 --> 00:10:09.801
You're hiding him, aren't you?

00:10:09.801 --> 00:10:11.008
You're in touch with him, right?

00:10:11.008 --> 00:10:13.161
Do you even know how much he stole?

00:10:13.161 --> 00:10:16.014
Because of your dad, we're all ruined.

00:10:49.816 --> 00:10:50.861
Tae Hyung,

00:10:50.861 --> 00:10:52.546
you like orange juice, don't you?

00:10:52.546 --> 00:10:55.601
Gosh, the ice melted.

00:10:55.601 --> 00:10:58.363
Thanks for reaching out.

00:10:58.363 --> 00:11:00.674
We're not exactly in a place to catch up.

00:11:00.674 --> 00:11:02.966
So I'll get straight to it.

00:11:02.966 --> 00:11:04.931
I don't know what this is about,

00:11:04.931 --> 00:11:07.839
but showing up out of nowhere like last time,

00:11:08.685 --> 00:11:11.720
I don't want that happening again.

00:11:15.248 --> 00:11:17.260
Tae Hyung, I'm still your dad...

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.194
"Dad?"

00:11:20.002 --> 00:11:22.115
You left a little kid behind because of money.

00:11:22.115 --> 00:11:24.435
And now you call yourself that?

00:11:24.435 --> 00:11:26.088
What,

00:11:26.088 --> 00:11:28.248
do you expect to be treated like a dad?

00:11:28.248 --> 00:11:31.111
Isn't that completely shameless?

00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:33.037
Do you even know

00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:36.124
how I've been living all this time?

00:11:39.684 --> 00:11:41.777
So let's just

00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:45.724
keep living our own lives.

00:11:46.633 --> 00:11:49.846
Don't put us in this situation again.

00:11:55.404 --> 00:11:57.129
Tae Hyung.

00:11:57.129 --> 00:11:58.734
You're right.

00:11:58.734 --> 00:12:02.410
I know I have no right coming back like this.

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.264
But could you

00:12:04.264 --> 00:12:07.362
give me one chance?

00:12:07.362 --> 00:12:09.464
It's late, I know.

00:12:09.464 --> 00:12:13.290
But I want to try to be a real father.

00:12:14.679 --> 00:12:16.945
No.

00:12:16.945 --> 00:12:19.627
You don't have to.

00:12:19.627 --> 00:12:23.886
I erased the idea of family
from my life a long time ago.

00:12:26.893 --> 00:12:28.845
I'm sorry.

00:12:31.712 --> 00:12:33.948
I came back

00:12:33.948 --> 00:12:35.847
too late.

00:12:40.707 --> 00:12:43.714
I hope we never see each other again.

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.886
Sir,

00:13:04.886 --> 00:13:07.364
is it true we got picked
as this quarter's key project?

00:13:07.364 --> 00:13:10.831
I can't believe the GloMarket project
is BS's core project!

00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:12.703
Am I getting promoted this time?

00:13:12.703 --> 00:13:14.185
Wait,

00:13:14.185 --> 00:13:16.546
what exactly is a BS core project?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:17.638
Oh, right.

00:13:17.638 --> 00:13:20.032
You're still on contract.
You probably don't know.

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:22.550
We have an internal company chat.

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.783
Full-timers only.

00:13:23.783 --> 00:13:26.312
It blew up this morning.

00:13:26.312 --> 00:13:27.995
This must be the first you're hearing of it.

00:13:27.995 --> 00:13:29.503
No.

00:13:29.503 --> 00:13:31.128
It was just finalized.

00:13:31.128 --> 00:13:33.894
That's why the announcement was late.

00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:37.238
Let me make this official.

00:13:37.238 --> 00:13:39.710
Every quarter, headquarters selects

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:41.128
a core strategic project.

00:13:41.128 --> 00:13:43.332
And our GloMarket proposal has been chosen.

00:13:43.332 --> 00:13:44.967
Yes!

00:13:44.967 --> 00:13:46.842
If we pull this off,

00:13:46.842 --> 00:13:48.761
the incentives are solid.

00:13:48.761 --> 00:13:51.113
And it's a huge boost for performance reviews.

00:13:51.113 --> 00:13:52.264
In short,

00:13:52.264 --> 00:13:54.817
this is our big shot.

00:13:56.561 --> 00:13:57.812
What's wrong, Woo Joo?

00:13:57.812 --> 00:13:59.443
Daycare's fun. Right?

00:13:59.443 --> 00:14:00.669
Oh no.

00:14:00.669 --> 00:14:03.716
He doesn't want to go today?

00:14:05.399 --> 00:14:06.823
Why doesn't he want to go?

00:14:06.823 --> 00:14:09.201
Once he's there, he's fine.

00:14:09.201 --> 00:14:10.700
He just gets like this sometimes.

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:13.359
- Oh dear.
- Give him here.

00:14:13.359 --> 00:14:16.163
I'll take him.

00:14:16.163 --> 00:14:17.530
You will?

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:20.187
My mom's great with kids
around the neighborhood.

00:14:20.187 --> 00:14:23.045
Just think of it as a drop-off helper.

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:26.156
I'd really appreciate it,
I just feel bad imposing.

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:30.177
If you feel that way, then hire her officially.

00:14:30.177 --> 00:14:32.013
I'll give you a family discount.

00:14:33.106 --> 00:14:34.140
That's nonsense.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.559
- Go on, hurry.
- She would like it.

00:14:38.595 --> 00:14:40.354
Then please, grandma.

00:14:40.354 --> 00:14:41.547
Okay, don't worry.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.881
Woo Joo, listen to Grandma and be good.

00:14:45.241 --> 00:14:47.419
You listen to Grandma too.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:48.960
I always do.

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.599
Bye, see you later.

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.210
Say "bye, uncle."

00:14:56.614 --> 00:14:59.366
Mom, he's starting to look like a real uncle.

00:14:59.366 --> 00:15:03.076
I was worried how a young guy
would raise a kid,

00:15:03.076 --> 00:15:06.490
but he's doing pretty well.

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:07.603
Let's go.

00:15:07.603 --> 00:15:08.842
Deep bow.

00:15:08.842 --> 00:15:10.384
Thank you. One more time.

00:15:10.384 --> 00:15:12.326
That's right.

00:15:12.326 --> 00:15:14.866
Goodbye.

00:15:14.866 --> 00:15:17.828
Woo Joo, did you have fun today?

00:15:25.077 --> 00:15:27.090
Hi, Woo Joo.

00:15:37.694 --> 00:15:40.793
Thanks for giving us a ride.

00:15:40.793 --> 00:15:42.527
Of course I would.

00:15:42.527 --> 00:15:46.420
You've been buried in work
with that workaholic boss.

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.474
Right?

00:15:48.474 --> 00:15:49.678
Yeah,

00:15:49.678 --> 00:15:51.911
that's true.

00:15:51.911 --> 00:15:52.964
By the way,

00:15:52.964 --> 00:15:55.873
do you always pick him up after work?

00:15:55.873 --> 00:15:56.913
That must be exhausting.

00:15:56.913 --> 00:15:59.920
I try to, whenever I can.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.472
I feel like I don't get enough time with him.

00:16:02.472 --> 00:16:04.278
So at least on the walk home,

00:16:04.278 --> 00:16:06.698
we get to talk.

00:16:07.551 --> 00:16:10.728
You're doing great, Woo Hyun Jin.

00:16:10.728 --> 00:16:12.624
That's impressive.

00:16:27.147 --> 00:16:29.539
Thank you.

00:16:29.539 --> 00:16:31.696
Can I come up for a second?

00:16:31.696 --> 00:16:32.864
What?

00:16:32.864 --> 00:16:34.737
No.

00:16:37.743 --> 00:16:38.840
Oh, I get it.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.999
You're just changing the door lock.

00:16:41.999 --> 00:16:44.272
Then why do you think I came up to your place?

00:16:44.272 --> 00:16:46.003
No, I mean...

00:16:46.003 --> 00:16:49.400
I really wasn't thinking anything weird.

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.983
Do you have a drill?

00:16:51.983 --> 00:16:54.097
This thing's not working.

00:16:54.097 --> 00:16:56.763
Yes, I do. One second.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.847
I'm home. Why's the door...

00:17:38.967 --> 00:17:41.100
Oh, you're back.

00:17:46.703 --> 00:17:48.597
What is this?

00:17:50.368 --> 00:17:53.069
What are you doing here this late?

00:17:54.698 --> 00:17:56.558
He's replacing the door lock.

00:17:56.558 --> 00:17:58.563
You know, he's the landlord.

00:17:58.563 --> 00:18:01.119
I'm switching it to a security lock.

00:18:01.119 --> 00:18:03.284
Just to be safe.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.061
You've got to hold it steady for it to fit.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:25.092
It's crooked.

00:18:25.092 --> 00:18:26.288
Let go for a second.

00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:27.373
Don't force it.

00:18:27.373 --> 00:18:28.531
It's sticking out.

00:18:28.531 --> 00:18:30.155
See? It's crooked.

00:18:30.155 --> 00:18:32.586
- Fix it.
- It's because you just drove it in.

00:18:32.586 --> 00:18:33.806
What, then you want me to say

00:18:33.806 --> 00:18:36.779
"Here it comes" before I do it?

00:18:40.859 --> 00:18:42.722
Hey, kid. It's crooked, right?

00:18:44.001 --> 00:18:47.427
See? Kids don't lie.

00:18:49.354 --> 00:18:51.348
Come here. It's not safe.

00:18:51.348 --> 00:18:52.934
Hyun Jin.

00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:54.566
- Yes?
- Where'd she go?

00:18:54.566 --> 00:18:55.692
Come here.

00:18:55.692 --> 00:18:58.713
- Sleepy?
- Come on.

00:18:58.713 --> 00:19:00.322
Got something on you?

00:19:00.322 --> 00:19:03.757
What did you get into, Sun Woo Joo?

00:19:03.757 --> 00:19:04.874
Woo Joo.

00:19:04.874 --> 00:19:06.912
Here.

00:19:06.912 --> 00:19:08.878
Hold still.

00:19:11.312 --> 00:19:13.634
Drive safe.

00:19:13.634 --> 00:19:16.675
If anything happens to Hyun Jin,

00:19:16.675 --> 00:19:18.895
please let me know.

00:19:20.136 --> 00:19:22.747
There's been a lot going on
in this building lately.

00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:24.924
I'm worried.

00:19:26.507 --> 00:19:29.412
That's not really your concern.

00:19:29.412 --> 00:19:31.519
I'll handle the worrying.

00:19:31.519 --> 00:19:33.839
Stay out of my family's business.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:37.220
I won't let Hyun Jin get hurt.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:39.549
I'm confident about that.

00:19:39.549 --> 00:19:41.436
And you?

00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:43.389
Are you confident?

00:19:43.389 --> 00:19:44.450
What?

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:46.387
Your father.

00:19:46.387 --> 00:19:48.620
He worries me.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.788
It sounded like you haven't been in touch.

00:19:52.788 --> 00:19:54.734
And I still can't understand

00:19:54.734 --> 00:19:58.754
why he was inside an empty house.

00:20:02.001 --> 00:20:04.157
At the very least, while you're living here,

00:20:04.157 --> 00:20:07.764
make sure Hyun Jin isn't put at risk

00:20:07.764 --> 00:20:09.971
because of you.

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.061
Seriously?

00:20:32.061 --> 00:20:33.729
I'm honored.

00:20:33.729 --> 00:20:34.730
When do I start?

00:20:35.815 --> 00:20:38.734
I can't believe I get to work under Amy Choo.

00:20:38.734 --> 00:20:41.195
You'll mostly be working with me anyway.

00:20:41.195 --> 00:20:42.710
- You sure you're good with that?
- I...

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:46.534
I can't miss the historic moment
you take the lead.

00:20:46.534 --> 00:20:50.862
And I get "Filmpluto" on my résumé.

00:20:52.116 --> 00:20:53.499
I've got to tell my mom.

00:20:53.499 --> 00:20:55.652
I'm calling home.

00:21:01.549 --> 00:21:03.229
Something's up with you.

00:21:04.635 --> 00:21:07.429
You finally landed the lead.

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:09.415
You should be celebrating.

00:21:09.415 --> 00:21:12.475
Instead you look like you need a drink.

00:21:13.227 --> 00:21:15.196
What is it?

00:21:15.855 --> 00:21:18.228
You've got sharp instincts.

00:21:19.792 --> 00:21:21.715
Actually...

00:21:22.688 --> 00:21:26.250
A guy claiming to be my father
showed up not long ago.

00:21:27.491 --> 00:21:29.440
Your father?

00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:33.893
I don't think you've ever talked about him.

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:36.800
He was barely ever home.

00:21:38.961 --> 00:21:41.422
He knew he had two little kids,

00:21:41.422 --> 00:21:44.808
but he'd mess up and
disappear whenever he could.

00:21:46.218 --> 00:21:49.358
He walked away back then,
and now he shows up again.

00:21:50.514 --> 00:21:53.107
That's how it always felt.

00:21:54.685 --> 00:21:57.479
Even when I was home,

00:21:57.479 --> 00:22:00.865
it felt like my heart was somewhere else.

00:22:04.153 --> 00:22:06.287
You wouldn't get it.

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:09.856
So what about now?

00:22:09.856 --> 00:22:11.148
Now?

00:22:11.148 --> 00:22:13.996
In the house you live in now,

00:22:13.996 --> 00:22:16.957
do you still feel that way?

00:22:16.957 --> 00:22:19.259
Now...

00:22:21.795 --> 00:22:24.289
No.

00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:26.762
That place actually feels like home.

00:22:28.344 --> 00:22:31.864
Sometimes it even feels like a real family.

00:22:35.197 --> 00:22:37.959
That's why I'm more afraid.

00:22:39.892 --> 00:22:42.925
I'm scared I might ruin it.

00:22:45.562 --> 00:22:46.635
Oh gosh.

00:22:46.635 --> 00:22:48.197
He should've thrown this out sooner.

00:22:48.197 --> 00:22:50.862
Doo Sik's never around when we need him.

00:22:50.862 --> 00:22:52.228
- Oh, wait.
- Let's just get rid of it.

00:22:52.228 --> 00:22:53.911
Put it down.

00:22:53.911 --> 00:22:55.204
It's too heavy. Right?

00:22:55.204 --> 00:22:56.330
I've got this.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.732
Goodness.

00:22:58.732 --> 00:23:01.835
Oh, thank you.

00:23:01.835 --> 00:23:04.046
I don't think I've seen him before.

00:23:04.046 --> 00:23:05.312
- Who's he?
- Well...

00:23:05.312 --> 00:23:10.025
He's... Woo Joo's uncle's father.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.766
Hello.

00:23:13.766 --> 00:23:15.166
Thank you so much.

00:23:15.166 --> 00:23:16.767
- Hello.
- Yeah.

00:23:16.767 --> 00:23:17.810
Earlier today,

00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:21.340
a car came flying out of nowhere
and almost hit the kids.

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.065
He saved them.

00:23:23.065 --> 00:23:25.544
I'm really grateful.

00:23:25.544 --> 00:23:28.288
But why are you still here?

00:23:28.288 --> 00:23:30.906
Is no one home?

00:23:30.906 --> 00:23:33.139
It's... complicated.

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.911
I guess

00:23:35.911 --> 00:23:38.183
Tae Hyung doesn't want to see me.

00:23:38.183 --> 00:23:39.415
What?

00:23:39.415 --> 00:23:44.128
Why would a son not want to see his father?

00:23:44.128 --> 00:23:47.172
I was too busy chasing money.

00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:50.245
I wasn't much of a dad.

00:23:51.373 --> 00:23:53.762
I don't really deserve to be one.

00:23:53.762 --> 00:23:56.265
I understand how he feels.

00:23:56.265 --> 00:23:58.017
I'll just be satisfied

00:23:58.017 --> 00:24:00.652
seeing him from a distance.

00:24:00.652 --> 00:24:03.800
What do you mean deserve?

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.901
When you can see your child,
you should see them as much as you can.

00:24:07.901 --> 00:24:11.613
How is he going to live with that regret later?

00:24:11.613 --> 00:24:14.694
Oh, there's Woo Joo's aunt.

00:24:14.694 --> 00:24:16.531
Woo Joo!

00:24:18.379 --> 00:24:20.180
So cute.

00:24:25.919 --> 00:24:27.379
Well...

00:24:27.379 --> 00:24:30.507
I'm sorry again about the other day.

00:24:30.507 --> 00:24:32.185
I really startled you, didn't I?

00:24:32.185 --> 00:24:34.445
Oh, it's okay.

00:24:35.095 --> 00:24:37.431
And please, you can speak casually.

00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:42.689
I'm not great at that with someone I just met.

00:24:42.689 --> 00:24:45.105
If you'd prefer, I'll speak more casually.

00:24:45.105 --> 00:24:46.106
By the way,

00:24:46.106 --> 00:24:48.067
what's this little guy's name?

00:24:48.067 --> 00:24:50.069
Woo Joo. Sun Woo Joo.

00:24:50.069 --> 00:24:51.871
Woo Joo.

00:24:53.354 --> 00:24:57.143
Would it be okay if I held him?

00:25:01.455 --> 00:25:02.993
Sure.

00:25:02.993 --> 00:25:05.174
Want this?

00:25:08.645 --> 00:25:09.880
Woo Joo. Come here.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:11.322
There you go.

00:25:11.322 --> 00:25:12.549
Good boy.

00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:13.926
Hey.

00:25:13.926 --> 00:25:15.375
Woo Joo,

00:25:15.375 --> 00:25:17.611
do you know who I am?

00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:20.146
- No.
- He says no.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:24.058
He's a handsome boy.

00:25:24.058 --> 00:25:26.814
He looks just like Woo Jin when he was little.

00:25:26.814 --> 00:25:28.357
Right?

00:25:28.357 --> 00:25:30.317
He really does look like Woo Jin.

00:25:30.317 --> 00:25:32.729
Especially that nose.

00:25:32.729 --> 00:25:36.671
It's just like Woo Jin's when he was a kid.

00:25:40.035 --> 00:25:41.453
Actually,

00:25:41.453 --> 00:25:44.255
Tae Hyung told me last time

00:25:46.667 --> 00:25:50.053
he hoped we'd never see each other again.

00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:54.508
He said that?

00:25:54.508 --> 00:25:56.468
You know,

00:25:56.468 --> 00:25:59.734
you can't just cut off
a parent-child bond like that.

00:26:00.389 --> 00:26:02.599
Once I see his face,

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:05.070
I want to see them again.

00:26:06.228 --> 00:26:08.469
I want to make up

00:26:08.469 --> 00:26:10.812
for everything I did wrong.

00:26:11.650 --> 00:26:13.660
That's just how I feel.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.156
So even knowing he doesn't want to see me,

00:26:17.156 --> 00:26:19.542
I keep coming back.

00:26:20.742 --> 00:26:22.895
I don't know.

00:26:27.749 --> 00:26:32.379
I don't know the whole story,

00:26:32.379 --> 00:26:35.924
but Tae Hyung will probably need time.

00:26:35.924 --> 00:26:41.069
Walls like that don't come down easily.

00:26:45.184 --> 00:26:48.152
You're right.

00:26:48.896 --> 00:26:52.490
This is all my fault anyway.

00:26:54.232 --> 00:27:02.326
If you ever need help, even just a little,
please tell me.

00:27:02.326 --> 00:27:05.946
It's not easy raising a child
when you're young.

00:27:07.831 --> 00:27:09.737
Okay.

00:27:10.667 --> 00:27:11.766
Hey, Woo Joo.

00:27:11.766 --> 00:27:13.747
What's that?

00:27:13.747 --> 00:27:15.255
A police car?

00:27:15.255 --> 00:27:17.943
That's cool.

00:27:17.943 --> 00:27:19.736
Does it fly too?

00:27:21.178 --> 00:27:22.304
You closed the door.

00:27:22.304 --> 00:27:23.804
Ready for takeoff.

00:27:23.804 --> 00:27:26.090
Here you go.

00:27:26.934 --> 00:27:28.185
Is this for me?

00:27:28.185 --> 00:27:30.000
You have it.

00:27:31.063 --> 00:27:32.731
Alright, shoes off.

00:27:32.731 --> 00:27:34.191
All done. Let's get in.

00:27:34.191 --> 00:27:38.257
Mr. Sun Woo Joo, home from work?

00:27:39.556 --> 00:27:41.626
You're late.

00:27:48.744 --> 00:27:50.597
What?

00:27:51.416 --> 00:27:53.210
Actually...

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:56.504
I met your father.

00:27:56.504 --> 00:27:57.572
What?

00:27:57.572 --> 00:28:01.468
It just happened. We ran into each other.

00:28:01.468 --> 00:28:04.233
Did he say anything to you?
Did he ask for money?

00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:05.389
No, nothing like that.

00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:07.924
He didn't say much.

00:28:08.805 --> 00:28:10.185
He just seemed

00:28:10.185 --> 00:28:13.480
really happy to see Woo Joo.

00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:15.042
He told me

00:28:15.042 --> 00:28:18.609
you don't want to see him again.

00:28:19.695 --> 00:28:23.288
But he came anyway.
He said he just wanted to see you.

00:28:23.288 --> 00:28:26.451
So... you let him see Woo Joo?

00:28:26.451 --> 00:28:29.830
You know I cut him off. Why even listen to him?

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.984
Do you have any idea how...

00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:35.043
Well...

00:28:35.043 --> 00:28:37.101
He just wanted to talk.

00:28:37.101 --> 00:28:38.839
How was I supposed to refuse?

00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:40.173
And whatever happened,

00:28:40.173 --> 00:28:42.301
he's still your father.

00:28:42.301 --> 00:28:45.377
You could at least hear him out once.

00:28:45.377 --> 00:28:47.472
Hear what?

00:28:47.472 --> 00:28:49.725
Why he never looked for me
for almost twenty years?

00:28:49.725 --> 00:28:51.685
Is that the story?

00:28:51.685 --> 00:28:55.721
Leaving a nine-year-old at a children's home
and never coming back.

00:28:56.898 --> 00:28:58.651
Sun Woo Jin or him, it's the same thing.

00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:01.653
What explanation could there be?

00:29:01.653 --> 00:29:03.751
Maybe...

00:29:04.615 --> 00:29:07.695
maybe Woo Jin had a reason.

00:29:08.535 --> 00:29:10.575
Right.

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:14.499
Then I guess I had a reason to be abandoned.

00:29:14.499 --> 00:29:16.084
That's not what I meant.

00:29:16.084 --> 00:29:19.504
I've thought about it over and over.

00:29:19.504 --> 00:29:21.048
What did I do wrong?

00:29:21.048 --> 00:29:23.537
What made my brother, my dad

00:29:24.348 --> 00:29:26.927
throw me away?

00:29:27.846 --> 00:29:30.499
I've thought about it for years.

00:29:31.767 --> 00:29:34.487
And I still don't know.

00:29:38.435 --> 00:29:40.428
Honestly...

00:29:42.361 --> 00:29:45.601
When Sun Woo Jin said he'd come back for me...

00:29:47.824 --> 00:29:50.017
I already knew.

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.090
Like,

00:29:54.975 --> 00:29:57.561
"He's never coming back."

00:29:58.835 --> 00:30:01.276
"So this is how I get left behind."

00:30:02.589 --> 00:30:05.467
That's why I forced myself to believe

00:30:05.467 --> 00:30:08.482
if I waited, he would come.

00:30:10.103 --> 00:30:13.822
If I didn't believe that,
I think I would've lost it.

00:30:17.024 --> 00:30:18.980
Tae Hyung...

00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.775
I didn't mean it like that.

00:30:21.775 --> 00:30:24.455
I didn't understand the whole situation.

00:30:30.784 --> 00:30:34.037
Talking about this stuff just feels pathetic.

00:30:34.955 --> 00:30:37.557
That's why I never did.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:42.655
At least you...

00:30:43.463 --> 00:30:46.092
I thought you'd be on my side.

00:31:02.170 --> 00:31:05.944
Gosh, isn't Hanbi Foods shady?

00:31:05.944 --> 00:31:07.808
No ethics at all.

00:31:07.808 --> 00:31:09.293
[Final Partner Selection On Hold:
Hanbi Food submitted a similar proposal.]

00:31:09.293 --> 00:31:11.491
Hanbi Foods beat us to it.

00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:13.910
Their proposal is almost identical to ours.

00:31:13.910 --> 00:31:16.820
Same menu lineup. Even the same vendors.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.540
So what do we do?

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:21.126
Our vendors are already asking what's going on.

00:31:21.126 --> 00:31:24.025
For now, let's each handle what we can.

00:31:24.737 --> 00:31:26.625
Hello.

00:31:34.097 --> 00:31:35.874
Did you hear about Planning Team 3?

00:31:35.874 --> 00:31:38.643
Their whole proposal got leaked.

00:31:38.643 --> 00:31:42.230
Hanbi Foods is shady, sure, but who did it?

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.222
Who leaked the files to them?

00:31:44.222 --> 00:31:45.373
Haven't you heard?

00:31:45.373 --> 00:31:47.332
Apparently it was someone
on contract in that team.

00:31:47.332 --> 00:31:49.362
Honestly, it was kind of suspicious.

00:31:49.362 --> 00:31:51.279
With those credentials, how did she get into BS

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:53.928
and lead a core project as a contract employee?

00:31:53.928 --> 00:31:57.370
And Manager Park was always protecting her.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:58.622
That's true.

00:31:58.622 --> 00:32:02.000
Didn't she get in here because of him?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.213
- They went to the same school.
- Right.

00:32:07.923 --> 00:32:09.591
It wasn't me.

00:32:09.591 --> 00:32:12.260
I didn't leak the proposal.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.512
And like you said,

00:32:13.512 --> 00:32:15.247
how would a contract employee

00:32:15.247 --> 00:32:18.299
even pull something like that?

00:32:18.299 --> 00:32:20.644
Isn't that exactly why you could?

00:32:20.644 --> 00:32:21.784
You're on contract.

00:32:21.784 --> 00:32:24.523
You probably don't feel
any loyalty to the company.

00:32:24.523 --> 00:32:27.234
And in a few months, you'll be gone anyway.

00:32:27.234 --> 00:32:30.420
Do you have any proof that I did it?

00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:31.738
Well, by that logic,

00:32:31.738 --> 00:32:34.366
you don't have proof that you didn't.

00:32:34.366 --> 00:32:36.743
You eavesdrop on us and then act like this?

00:32:36.743 --> 00:32:38.696
Let's go.

00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:48.554
This is the full-timer chat,
and things are getting weird.

00:32:48.554 --> 00:32:50.457
[BS Food Internal Chat]
Please manage your files more carefully.

00:32:50.457 --> 00:32:53.009
I heard Hanbi Food even tried to recruit her.

00:32:53.009 --> 00:32:55.895
Then that proves she leaked it.

00:33:04.688 --> 00:33:07.315
I had a feeling you might be out here.

00:33:07.315 --> 00:33:09.621
And you are.

00:33:13.196 --> 00:33:16.582
I just needed some air.

00:33:28.336 --> 00:33:31.214
Don't let the gossip get to you.

00:33:31.214 --> 00:33:33.383
This is our project.

00:33:33.383 --> 00:33:36.469
And you're doing more than fine.

00:33:39.639 --> 00:33:41.933
I'm really okay.

00:33:41.933 --> 00:33:44.597
You don't have to pretend in front of me.

00:33:44.597 --> 00:33:48.890
If it's hard, just say it's hard.

00:33:50.483 --> 00:33:53.528
And sometimes,

00:33:53.528 --> 00:33:56.823
lean on me a little.

00:33:56.823 --> 00:33:59.951
I want to be someone you can rely on.

00:33:59.951 --> 00:34:01.843
Okay?

00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:06.842
Okay, I will.

00:34:07.459 --> 00:34:09.958
Thank you. Always.

00:34:18.002 --> 00:34:22.648
Which one looks more like it was crafted
by a true artisan?

00:34:24.935 --> 00:34:26.770
Definitely the one on the right.

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:30.028
It feels more handcrafted.

00:34:31.274 --> 00:34:32.317
Good.

00:34:32.317 --> 00:34:36.043
Then we'll remove
all leaked concepts from the lineup.

00:34:36.043 --> 00:34:39.360
We'll focus on one item, tteokbokki,

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.542
the dish that best highlights
the flavor of gochujang.

00:34:41.542 --> 00:34:44.287
The samples are ready,

00:34:44.287 --> 00:34:46.498
so we can start internal tastings right away.

00:34:46.498 --> 00:34:49.000
Then let's schedule the tasting
as soon as possible.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.271
Ms. Woo Hyun Jin,

00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:52.480
from now on, focus solely
on preparing the pitch.

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.340
Yes, I'll get right on it.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.009
I heard the contract employee
from Planning Team 3 did it.

00:34:58.009 --> 00:35:00.637
- Really?
- Yeah, it's all over the office.

00:35:00.637 --> 00:35:02.514
That's bold for a temp.

00:35:02.514 --> 00:35:05.016
She can't leak to a competitor. Right?

00:35:05.016 --> 00:35:07.227
I can't trust new hires these days.

00:35:07.227 --> 00:35:08.307
Exactly.

00:35:08.307 --> 00:35:11.553
How's she supposed to survive here after this?

00:35:16.528 --> 00:35:18.863
You'll probably have to work late tonight,
right?

00:35:19.627 --> 00:35:22.882
As you see, things got messy.

00:35:24.536 --> 00:35:26.620
About yesterday...

00:35:27.497 --> 00:35:30.500
I was too emotional.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.752
I shouldn't have taken it out on you.

00:35:32.752 --> 00:35:34.450
No.

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:38.336
I spoke without really knowing the whole story.

00:35:39.009 --> 00:35:41.261
Hyun Jin.

00:35:41.261 --> 00:35:43.030
Let's go.

00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:45.020
Yes.

00:35:46.345 --> 00:35:47.646
You look busy.

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.151
Go take care of it.

00:35:49.151 --> 00:35:51.405
Yeah, I've got another meeting.

00:35:51.405 --> 00:35:53.678
Let's talk later.

00:36:04.442 --> 00:36:06.202
How could a proposal leak happen?

00:36:06.202 --> 00:36:08.913
We have to win the GloMarket deal.

00:36:08.913 --> 00:36:10.790
We can't lose this.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.375
How's the pitch coming along?

00:36:12.375 --> 00:36:14.655
You know that's the most important part, right?

00:36:14.655 --> 00:36:15.795
Yes.

00:36:15.795 --> 00:36:18.099
Ms. Woo Hyun Jin has been preparing it.

00:36:18.099 --> 00:36:19.999
Who?

00:36:19.999 --> 00:36:22.792
I'm preparing it, sir.

00:36:24.612 --> 00:36:26.056
Instead of her...

00:36:26.056 --> 00:36:28.260
How about Assistant Manager Choi
from Planning Team 1?

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.327
From what I saw last time,
with his overseas background,

00:36:30.327 --> 00:36:32.771
his English is solid. Very global.

00:36:32.771 --> 00:36:33.796
What about him?

00:36:33.796 --> 00:36:37.233
Our Planning Team 3
has been developing this project

00:36:37.233 --> 00:36:39.682
since before it was selected
as a BS core project.

00:36:39.682 --> 00:36:41.029
So it's only right

00:36:41.029 --> 00:36:43.505
that someone from our team handles the pitch.

00:36:43.505 --> 00:36:45.784
The presenter represents the company.

00:36:45.784 --> 00:36:48.286
We need someone of that caliber up there.

00:36:48.286 --> 00:36:50.392
Replace her.

00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:52.457
Then...

00:36:52.457 --> 00:36:54.918
Please review them yourself and decide.

00:36:54.918 --> 00:36:56.461
Review what?

00:36:56.461 --> 00:36:58.838
Assistant Manager Choi from Planning Team 1
and Staff Woo Hyun Jin.

00:36:58.838 --> 00:37:02.467
Please hear both of their pitches
and make the call.

00:37:02.467 --> 00:37:04.552
From the company's standpoint,

00:37:04.552 --> 00:37:06.096
it does make sense to send

00:37:06.096 --> 00:37:08.918
the most capable person
for a high-stakes presentation.

00:37:08.918 --> 00:37:10.725
What do you think, sir?

00:37:10.725 --> 00:37:15.502
Internal competition for a pitch slot
isn't uncommon.

00:37:15.502 --> 00:37:19.788
It may actually be the fairest approach.

00:37:22.695 --> 00:37:24.405
Well...

00:37:24.405 --> 00:37:26.533
That's not a bad idea.

00:37:26.533 --> 00:37:29.485
Ms. Woo Hyun Jin, what's your position?

00:37:30.745 --> 00:37:32.789
I'll do it.

00:37:32.789 --> 00:37:35.853
I'll compete fairly.

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:38.378
Then, you're the hero of our villa.

00:37:38.378 --> 00:37:40.671
You caught the thief. Right?

00:37:40.671 --> 00:37:41.756
No, no.

00:37:41.756 --> 00:37:44.033
I didn't catch him.

00:37:44.033 --> 00:37:46.469
They just said my testimony helped.

00:37:46.469 --> 00:37:48.096
That's basically the same thing.

00:37:48.096 --> 00:37:49.964
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

00:37:49.964 --> 00:37:51.141
But mister,

00:37:51.141 --> 00:37:54.657
have you still not made up
with Woo Joo's uncle?

00:37:56.396 --> 00:37:58.356
That guy has no respect.

00:37:58.356 --> 00:38:00.108
That brat has no manners.

00:38:00.108 --> 00:38:01.734
I could tell the first time I saw him.

00:38:01.734 --> 00:38:03.314
He's got zero manners.

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:04.737
Yeah, he was a little rude.

00:38:04.737 --> 00:38:06.990
That's what I'm saying.

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:09.200
Don't be too hard on him.

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.127
It's because I wasn't much of a father.

00:38:12.912 --> 00:38:14.532
Honestly,

00:38:14.532 --> 00:38:17.750
just seeing his face in passing

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.961
is enough for me.

00:38:19.961 --> 00:38:22.630
Oh my, oh my. What's going on?

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.673
Unit 301!

00:38:23.673 --> 00:38:26.134
I will help you.

00:38:26.134 --> 00:38:28.678
Oh gosh, my back.

00:38:28.678 --> 00:38:30.138
He's so kind.

00:38:30.138 --> 00:38:32.082
Hello.

00:38:33.737 --> 00:38:35.700
Thank you.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.100
Tae Hyung.

00:39:00.251 --> 00:39:03.017
Oh my, that rude guy.

00:39:12.228 --> 00:39:14.662
Oh, it's already this late...

00:39:18.478 --> 00:39:20.262
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:39:21.594 --> 00:39:22.857
Yoon Seong?

00:39:22.857 --> 00:39:24.275
You're still here?

00:39:24.275 --> 00:39:25.598
Just about to leave.

00:39:25.598 --> 00:39:27.904
Get in.

00:39:27.904 --> 00:39:29.968
Thank you.

00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:46.172
The number you're calling is not...

00:39:46.172 --> 00:39:49.152
Why isn't she picking up?

00:39:50.176 --> 00:39:52.220
She's not picking up?

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.138
No, she's not.

00:39:54.138 --> 00:39:55.464
Your aunt's not picking up.

00:39:55.464 --> 00:39:56.641
Try calling her.

00:39:56.641 --> 00:39:58.893
Is Auntie not picking up?

00:39:58.893 --> 00:40:01.058
No, still not.

00:40:08.027 --> 00:40:10.280
Thanks for the ride.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.365
Hyun Jin.

00:40:12.365 --> 00:40:15.702
If you ever need my help, just say the word.

00:40:15.702 --> 00:40:18.087
I'll back you up.

00:40:21.791 --> 00:40:23.726
Yoon Seong.

00:40:23.726 --> 00:40:25.670
Can I ask you one favor?

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:27.714
Sure. Anything.

00:40:27.714 --> 00:40:30.967
This time, I don't want your help.

00:40:30.967 --> 00:40:31.968
What?

00:40:31.968 --> 00:40:34.137
I want to do this on my own.

00:40:34.137 --> 00:40:36.431
Without relying on you.

00:40:36.431 --> 00:40:39.309
I need to prove myself with my own skills

00:40:39.309 --> 00:40:43.440
so I can stand tall in front of everyone.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:45.328
Woo Hyun Jin...

00:40:49.490 --> 00:40:51.630
Alright.

00:40:52.655 --> 00:40:55.158
Looks like you've made up your mind.

00:40:55.158 --> 00:40:57.285
Thank you for understanding.

00:40:57.285 --> 00:40:59.120
It's not about understanding.

00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:01.331
It's about believing in you.

00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:05.376
I know you can handle this on your own.

00:41:05.376 --> 00:41:07.795
Just remember one thing.

00:41:07.795 --> 00:41:10.404
I'll always be behind you.

00:41:10.404 --> 00:41:12.967
Whether it's help or just someone to lean on,

00:41:12.967 --> 00:41:15.393
come to me if you need it.

00:41:24.437 --> 00:41:26.134
Woo Joo?

00:41:26.134 --> 00:41:28.053
Why are you here...

00:41:28.053 --> 00:41:30.193
You said you were leaving
but didn't answer your phone.

00:41:30.193 --> 00:41:31.861
We were worried.

00:41:31.861 --> 00:41:33.905
- Sorry.
- Auntie.

00:41:34.947 --> 00:41:37.986
Yoon Seong, I should go.

00:41:42.419 --> 00:41:43.481
Yoon Seong,

00:41:43.481 --> 00:41:46.064
It's late. You should head home too.

00:41:46.709 --> 00:41:48.628
Thank you.

00:41:48.628 --> 00:41:50.329
For what?

00:41:50.329 --> 00:41:51.964
For...

00:41:51.964 --> 00:41:55.426
not letting her go home alone this late.

00:41:55.426 --> 00:41:59.392
That's not something you need to thank me for.

00:42:03.476 --> 00:42:05.269
Woo Joo, your auntie's late, huh?

00:42:05.269 --> 00:42:07.242
Hyun Jin.

00:42:08.272 --> 00:42:10.951
I'll trust you and wait.

00:42:10.951 --> 00:42:13.807
When this project is over,

00:42:13.807 --> 00:42:16.160
let's go on a date.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.249
Hyun Jin.

00:42:32.609 --> 00:42:34.231
Do you still...

00:42:34.231 --> 00:42:36.956
have feelings for Manager Park?

00:42:36.956 --> 00:42:38.838
What?

00:42:40.125 --> 00:42:41.163
Well...

00:42:41.163 --> 00:42:44.245
Why would you ask that all of a sudden?

00:42:44.245 --> 00:42:45.313
I was just...

00:42:45.313 --> 00:42:49.212
curious how you really feel about him.

00:42:50.604 --> 00:42:53.317
And I wondered if you'd forgotten how I feel.

00:42:55.006 --> 00:42:57.524
I just wanted to say

00:42:57.524 --> 00:42:59.785
I'm here too, right beside you.

00:43:10.355 --> 00:43:12.578
Woo Joo's awake.

00:43:25.144 --> 00:43:27.097
I just wanted to say

00:43:27.097 --> 00:43:29.419
I'm here too, right beside you.

00:43:33.044 --> 00:43:36.424
Why would he say something like that...

00:43:37.966 --> 00:43:41.595
It's not like I don't know
he's always been by my side.

00:43:41.595 --> 00:43:44.192
When this project is over,

00:43:44.192 --> 00:43:46.652
let's go on a date.

00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:48.351
Whatever...

00:43:48.351 --> 00:43:49.603
Get it together.

00:43:49.603 --> 00:43:51.207
Focus on what's urgent.

00:43:51.207 --> 00:43:53.207
Work comes first.

00:44:54.826 --> 00:44:57.623
When did I fall asleep?

00:44:59.421 --> 00:45:00.757
You tired?

00:45:00.757 --> 00:45:03.351
Come on. I'll drive you home.

00:45:04.169 --> 00:45:07.013
No, I'm wide awake now.

00:45:07.013 --> 00:45:09.015
Aren't you heading out?

00:45:12.687 --> 00:45:14.587
I should...

00:45:14.587 --> 00:45:17.560
but I've got a mountain of work tonight.

00:46:09.701 --> 00:46:11.077
Oh, you're up?

00:46:11.077 --> 00:46:12.997
Come eat.

00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.543
Did you sleep well?

00:46:20.211 --> 00:46:21.755
When did you make all this?

00:46:21.755 --> 00:46:24.713
You haven't been eating properly lately.

00:46:24.713 --> 00:46:26.628
Eat.

00:46:27.218 --> 00:46:29.570
Thanks for the meal.

00:46:34.559 --> 00:46:36.745
This is so good.

00:46:42.776 --> 00:46:44.976
Is it good?

00:46:48.569 --> 00:46:50.496
Hey...

00:46:51.156 --> 00:46:53.174
Is something going on lately?

00:46:54.371 --> 00:46:56.206
I told you.

00:46:56.206 --> 00:46:59.242
Things are crazy because of that competitor.

00:46:59.242 --> 00:47:00.284
Really?

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:02.379
Yeah, it's all over the office.

00:47:02.379 --> 00:47:04.964
That's bold for a temp.

00:47:04.964 --> 00:47:07.583
I don't think that's all of it.

00:47:09.803 --> 00:47:12.963
What is it? What happened?

00:47:15.517 --> 00:47:18.730
Well... actually...

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.689
What? Are they insane?

00:47:20.689 --> 00:47:23.842
Accusing someone without proof
is workplace harassment.

00:47:23.842 --> 00:47:24.909
This isn't right.

00:47:24.909 --> 00:47:26.486
Call HR.

00:47:26.486 --> 00:47:28.527
This needs to be reported.

00:47:28.527 --> 00:47:30.615
Come on, it's not that serious.

00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:33.526
It is. Treating you differently
because you're a contract worker,

00:47:33.526 --> 00:47:35.412
looking down on you, that's harassment.

00:47:35.412 --> 00:47:38.540
People like that only learn
when it happens to them.

00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.646
This makes me so mad.

00:47:39.646 --> 00:47:41.102
Right?

00:47:42.468 --> 00:47:44.980
Hearing you say that
makes me feel so much better.

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.632
That's why I end up telling you everything.

00:47:47.632 --> 00:47:49.573
Hey, Hyun Jin.

00:47:49.573 --> 00:47:51.946
Why don't you come to our shoot today?

00:47:51.946 --> 00:47:53.655
Your shoot?

00:47:53.655 --> 00:47:55.306
We're filming a global brand today.

00:47:55.306 --> 00:47:56.933
All the models are foreigners.

00:47:56.933 --> 00:47:58.601
You said what you need right now

00:47:58.601 --> 00:48:00.311
is real market feedback, right?

00:48:00.311 --> 00:48:02.230
Instead of staring at data all day,

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:05.150
why not have them taste it

00:48:05.150 --> 00:48:07.235
and get real reactions?

00:48:07.235 --> 00:48:08.361
Seriously?

00:48:08.361 --> 00:48:10.879
That would be amazing.

00:48:10.879 --> 00:48:12.807
Yes!

00:48:12.807 --> 00:48:14.727
Wait...

00:48:15.621 --> 00:48:19.372
Then... what about Woo Joo?

00:48:19.372 --> 00:48:21.338
Woo Joo?

00:48:24.282 --> 00:48:26.504
It's my mother-in-law's birthday today,

00:48:26.504 --> 00:48:28.419
we were just heading out for dinner.

00:48:28.419 --> 00:48:31.134
I see. Then it can't be helped.

00:48:31.134 --> 00:48:32.510
Hello, Se Yeon.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:35.722
Can you look after Woo Joo for a little while?

00:48:35.722 --> 00:48:38.141
Ui Jun, do you have time?

00:48:38.141 --> 00:48:40.047
Okay.

00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:47.442
Of all days, everyone's busy today.

00:48:47.442 --> 00:48:48.810
What do we do?

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.906
We can't take Woo Joo to the shoot.

00:48:52.906 --> 00:48:56.250
I guess we don't have a choice.

00:49:02.957 --> 00:49:04.070
Hello?

00:49:04.070 --> 00:49:06.544
Hey, Unit 206. You called?

00:49:06.544 --> 00:49:07.796
Is something wrong?

00:49:07.796 --> 00:49:10.340
We need to step out urgently.

00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:13.092
Could you take care of Woo Joo for a bit?

00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:15.553
Oh dear...

00:49:15.553 --> 00:49:17.880
I'm out hiking with my mom right now.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:19.992
She's asking if we can look after Woo Joo.

00:49:21.851 --> 00:49:23.042
Okay.

00:49:23.042 --> 00:49:24.145
It can't be helped.

00:49:24.145 --> 00:49:26.125
Woo Joo's grandfather could take care of him.

00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:28.191
Oh right, then

00:49:28.191 --> 00:49:30.568
why don't you ask his grandfather?

00:49:30.568 --> 00:49:32.570
He's been saying he really misses Woo Joo.

00:49:32.570 --> 00:49:35.100
And Woo Joo absolutely loves him.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:37.335
Oh no, Never mind.

00:49:37.335 --> 00:49:39.219
Enjoy your time.

00:49:39.219 --> 00:49:41.126
Okay.

00:49:44.397 --> 00:49:47.564
Woo Joo, your Grandpa is here.

00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:49.629
Woo Joo, look at this.

00:49:49.629 --> 00:49:51.047
See the dinosaur?

00:49:51.047 --> 00:49:53.139
With the dinosaur...

00:49:54.525 --> 00:49:56.539
His food's in the fridge.

00:49:56.539 --> 00:49:58.615
And the diapers are right here.

00:49:58.615 --> 00:50:01.099
And if anything happens,

00:50:01.099 --> 00:50:02.934
please call me right away.

00:50:02.934 --> 00:50:04.672
Alright, don't worry.

00:50:04.672 --> 00:50:05.979
You said you're busy. Go on.

00:50:05.979 --> 00:50:08.815
Thank you.

00:50:08.815 --> 00:50:10.908
It disappeared, didn't it?

00:50:11.569 --> 00:50:12.709
Where do you think it is?

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:13.736
Here it is.

00:50:13.736 --> 00:50:16.222
You got it right.

00:50:20.967 --> 00:50:23.072
The dinosaur is here.

00:50:24.974 --> 00:50:27.000
Look at this.

00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:33.326
Chan Woo, bring the light in a little.

00:51:03.661 --> 00:51:05.580
We'll focus on the natural elements

00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:07.457
and shoot a lot using the background.

00:51:07.457 --> 00:51:10.243
It's my first time seeing him work like this.

00:51:19.093 --> 00:51:21.146
Oh, nice.

00:51:47.896 --> 00:51:49.422
- Hi, everyone.
- Hi.

00:51:49.422 --> 00:51:50.758
Can I have your attention please?

00:51:50.758 --> 00:51:51.823
Oh, sure.

00:51:51.823 --> 00:51:54.454
First of all,
thank you so much for helping us today.

00:51:54.454 --> 00:51:56.154
I really appreciate it.

00:51:56.154 --> 00:51:58.451
Try some tteokbokki and
let me know what you think.

00:51:58.451 --> 00:52:00.813
It doesn't matter if it's good or bad.

00:52:00.813 --> 00:52:02.909
I want to know your honest opinion.

00:52:02.909 --> 00:52:04.589
- Is it free?
- Yes, it's free.

00:52:04.589 --> 00:52:06.848
Because I love free food.

00:52:06.848 --> 00:52:08.755
I love the free meals!

00:52:08.755 --> 00:52:10.001
I can't wait!

00:52:13.745 --> 00:52:15.155
- Is this spicy?
- Yes, it's spicy.

00:52:15.155 --> 00:52:16.440
Nice.

00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:17.731
Let me smell it.

00:52:20.521 --> 00:52:22.011
- Thank you.
- What do you have here?

00:52:22.011 --> 00:52:23.033
What is this?

00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:25.547
Thank you.

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:31.212
It's good.

00:52:31.212 --> 00:52:32.410
How is it?

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:34.136
- It's so good.
- Good?

00:52:35.576 --> 00:52:36.601
Thanks.

00:52:36.601 --> 00:52:37.791
Can I interview you?

00:52:37.791 --> 00:52:39.240
- Sure, go ahead.
- Go.

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.433
Thank you.

00:52:41.513 --> 00:52:43.053
Come on.

00:52:43.053 --> 00:52:45.120
- Delicious.
- Oh my god. Okay, we got it.

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:47.220
I don't know.

00:52:56.017 --> 00:52:58.901
Today's been insane.

00:52:58.901 --> 00:53:00.821
Did you get any good feedback?

00:53:00.821 --> 00:53:02.113
Yeah. A lot.

00:53:02.113 --> 00:53:04.101
That's a relief.

00:53:04.741 --> 00:53:06.284
Oh, it's raining.

00:53:06.284 --> 00:53:07.326
It is.

00:53:07.326 --> 00:53:09.370
They didn't say anything about rain today.

00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:11.462
What do we do?

00:53:13.166 --> 00:53:15.095
Woo Hyun Jin.

00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:32.018
At least we found somewhere to take cover.

00:53:32.018 --> 00:53:33.269
You're not cold, are you?

00:53:33.269 --> 00:53:35.229
Why did it get dark so fast?

00:53:35.229 --> 00:53:37.315
The moon's out.

00:53:40.008 --> 00:53:41.837
Why are you smiling?

00:53:41.837 --> 00:53:43.783
Because I'm happy.

00:53:44.447 --> 00:53:47.492
I told you I like rainy days.

00:53:47.492 --> 00:53:50.508
Even though you said you don't.

00:53:51.534 --> 00:53:53.831
Well...

00:53:53.831 --> 00:53:57.354
Maybe it's not so bad.

00:54:00.963 --> 00:54:03.249
It'll stop soon.

00:54:36.322 --> 00:54:37.419
Oh no.

00:54:37.419 --> 00:54:40.319
You're completely soaked.

00:54:40.319 --> 00:54:41.546
It's fine.

00:54:41.546 --> 00:54:44.292
It's just a little rain. That's nothing.

00:54:46.310 --> 00:54:48.543
If it's just this much rain,

00:54:49.595 --> 00:54:51.859
I don't mind

00:54:51.859 --> 00:54:55.048
getting soaked with you.

00:54:56.665 --> 00:54:58.521
So...

00:54:58.521 --> 00:55:01.914
if things ever get tough, tell me.

00:55:03.192 --> 00:55:06.362
I may not be your umbrella,

00:55:06.362 --> 00:55:09.795
but at least until the rain falling on you

00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:13.585
finally stops,

00:55:14.704 --> 00:55:17.183
I can stay by your side.

00:55:23.588 --> 00:55:25.514
You too...

00:55:27.592 --> 00:55:30.477
You can do the same for me.

00:55:31.321 --> 00:55:32.847
I'm

00:55:32.847 --> 00:55:35.213
always on your side too.

00:55:36.142 --> 00:55:37.852
Back then...

00:55:37.852 --> 00:55:39.378
I just said that out of frustration.

00:55:39.378 --> 00:55:40.730
Forget it.

00:55:40.730 --> 00:55:41.813
I just...

00:55:41.813 --> 00:55:43.608
didn't want you to misunderstand.

00:55:43.608 --> 00:55:45.926
No misunderstandings, okay?

00:55:45.926 --> 00:55:48.519
I'm really on your side.

00:55:49.458 --> 00:55:50.632
Sure?

00:55:51.782 --> 00:55:53.682
Sure.

00:56:03.544 --> 00:56:05.213
I think I like it.

00:56:05.213 --> 00:56:07.144
Like what?

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:13.040
Rainy days.

00:56:20.036 --> 00:56:22.271
That's good.

00:56:22.271 --> 00:56:25.210
Now we have something we both like.

00:56:28.527 --> 00:56:30.446
For this tteokbokki meal kit,

00:56:30.446 --> 00:56:34.533
we plan to specifically tailor it
to suit global tastes.

00:56:34.533 --> 00:56:39.330
We'll introduce a soy-based option
and position it as the main flavor.

00:56:39.330 --> 00:56:40.481
Hello.

00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:43.079
I'm Woo Hyun Jin from Planning Team 3.

00:56:43.079 --> 00:56:44.710
A few years ago,

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:48.210
BS failed to secure the final contract
with GloMarket.

00:56:48.210 --> 00:56:50.049
But now, years later,

00:56:50.049 --> 00:56:52.677
why is GloMarket so receptive

00:56:52.677 --> 00:56:54.136
to our proposal?

00:56:54.136 --> 00:56:55.724
The answer lies

00:56:55.724 --> 00:56:58.556
in the global rise of K-culture.

00:56:58.556 --> 00:57:01.343
"Bringing out the true essence of K-food."

00:57:01.343 --> 00:57:04.617
For example, when people think of tteokbokki,

00:57:04.617 --> 00:57:06.188
they expect bold heat.

00:57:06.188 --> 00:57:09.332
So we plan to highlight
that signature spiciness even more.

00:57:14.523 --> 00:57:15.720
[On-site reaction footage]

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.246
- This is really good.
- It's good.

00:57:18.743 --> 00:57:20.273
Because I'm really good with spicy one.

00:57:20.273 --> 00:57:21.583
I'm the king of spicy food.

00:57:24.929 --> 00:57:27.154
It's spicy, but it's delicious.

00:57:27.154 --> 00:57:28.893
I think this sauce is amazing.

00:57:29.682 --> 00:57:31.855
It's hot, but it's so good.

00:57:32.591 --> 00:57:35.177
[A Focus on Cultural Experience]
BS's first slogan in challenging GloMarket

00:57:35.177 --> 00:57:37.138
was this.

00:57:37.138 --> 00:57:40.225
"Not just experiencing food,"

00:57:40.225 --> 00:57:42.393
"but experiencing culture."

00:57:42.393 --> 00:57:44.061
We should remember this.

00:57:44.061 --> 00:57:46.071
What do you think?

00:58:01.713 --> 00:58:04.353
This GloMarket pitch

00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:07.766
will be handled by our team.

00:58:08.502 --> 00:58:09.979
Ms. Woo Hyun Jin,

00:58:09.979 --> 00:58:12.094
great work.

[Temporary helper]
Did your presentation go well?

00:58:27.521 --> 00:58:29.023
Really?

00:58:29.023 --> 00:58:30.063
Really?

00:58:30.063 --> 00:58:31.984
Yeah, I knew she'd pull it off.

00:58:31.984 --> 00:58:34.737
Woo Joo, your auntie did it.

00:58:34.737 --> 00:58:35.802
High five.

High five.

So many cakes, right?

00:58:46.810 --> 00:58:48.959
Which one should we get?

00:58:48.959 --> 00:58:51.220
Which one do you want? Pick one.

00:58:51.220 --> 00:58:53.452
Which one?

00:58:53.452 --> 00:58:54.650
That one?

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:55.716
- Yeah.
- Okay.

00:58:55.716 --> 00:58:56.879
We'll take this one, please.

00:58:56.879 --> 00:58:58.692
Okay.

I don't have an umbrella...

00:59:32.784 --> 00:59:34.802
Yoon Seong?

00:59:42.596 --> 00:59:44.682
I like you.

00:59:48.833 --> 00:59:51.473
I really like you, Woo Hyun Jin.

01:00:51.123 --> 01:00:52.828
What? See, I told you.

01:00:52.828 --> 01:00:54.654
I said he had feelings for you.

01:00:54.654 --> 01:00:56.454
Just go out with me three times.

01:00:56.454 --> 01:00:57.478
As a man.

01:00:57.478 --> 01:00:58.778
It worked!

01:00:58.778 --> 01:01:00.891
Wait, hold on. Why are you tying your hair?

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:02.094
Want to do it together?

01:01:02.094 --> 01:01:03.554
Did you two... sleep together?

01:01:03.554 --> 01:01:05.761
Hyun Jin, I knew you could do it.

01:01:05.761 --> 01:01:06.785
Hyun Jin!

01:01:06.785 --> 01:01:08.819
- Where are we going?
- Let's go clear your head.

01:01:08.819 --> 01:01:11.218
I'm not just going to stand back anymore.

01:01:11.218 --> 01:01:12.243
Tae Hyung.

01:01:12.243 --> 01:01:14.245
So annoying...

01:01:14.245 --> 01:01:15.462
Woo Joo...

01:01:15.462 --> 01:01:17.236
- Woo Joo!
- Mommy!

01:01:17.236 --> 01:01:19.909
