WEBVTT

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.880
I didn't expect that face of yours

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:57.119
to be so effective.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.119
For him,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.960
it's likely a fatal weakness.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.920
Tonight, we

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.040
made eight figures.

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:09.599
But this is only the beginning.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.599
Can I take over Lang Jiu's business now?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.400
So impatient.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.560
The final showdown hasn't even started yet.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.879
When he's beaten down so hard he can't get up,

00:01:52.519 --> 00:01:53.319
what I promised you,

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.000
I will arrange it.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.199
Gentlemen, what is the meaning of this?

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.560
Winning and losing is part of the game.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:15.759
Besides,

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.680
isn't there still one round left?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240
The match isn't over yet.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:20.800
Cut the crap.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.280
Is this how you treat your guests?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.680
Unlucky in the game,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.400
but lucky in pleasure.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.599
How could I let you gentlemen

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.919
go home disappointed?

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:32.120
Come in.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.560
Gentlemen,

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:42.479
have some fun.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.840
Another round!

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.840
Come on.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.240
Where is Hei Ba?

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:06.520
Count off.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.400
Eight-two-six-zero-eight-one.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.960
You.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.879
Eight-six-six-five-eight-eight.

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:17.120
Darn it! Do you want to die?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:19.800
Please!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.039
Let me go!

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.240
Let you go?

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.319
Now that you're here,

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.319
your life is no longer yours to control.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.000
Listen up, all of you!

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:36.599
You've come to Nine Heavens,

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.599
entered Liheng.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.879
Whether you go to heaven or hell

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.039
depends on your own fate.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.080
Smile and get in line!

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.319
Just like when you

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.560
were all smiling and begging me

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.199
to sign streamer contracts with you.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.199
Once this is over,

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.120
every single one of you

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.599
will realize your greatest value.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.560
Help!

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.560
Save us!

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:09.800
Help!

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.800
Scream all you want.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.039
No one outside can hear you scream.

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:17.120
Save us!

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.800
Is anyone there?

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.279
Is anyone there?

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.720
Save us!

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.920
Let me go! Let me go!

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.319
Help!

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.120
Help!

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.279
Save me!

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.639
Is anyone there?

00:05:05.279 --> 00:05:06.199
Your face...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.720
Does it hurt?

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.639
You're just here to play pool.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.759
Everything else has nothing to do with you.

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:21.600
How did you...

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.519
Why are you here?

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:24.879
Do you know what kind of setup this is?

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:25.879
And you dared to come up here alone?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.720
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.439
Besides, my idol is here.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.040
I have to protect him.

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:39.160
Have you forgotten the lesson at the Abandoned building?

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:41.000
You won't be that lucky every time.

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:42.639
Like I said...

00:05:43.439 --> 00:05:44.399
You're on your own.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.560
What's with that attitude?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.279
Do you have any idea how dangerous it is here?

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:53.560
Why did you come here?

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.160
Who am I?

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.680
I'm a Popular Nine-ball streamer.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.720
Sneaking into a place like this...

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.120
...is a piece of cake for me.

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:03.279
You've got some nerve.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.879
How dare you sneak out to the high seas alone to compete?

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.480
Aren't you afraid of being sold by Lang Jiu?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.319
The grudge between us is already set.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.879
I have to beat him this time.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.279
I also discovered...

00:06:14.519 --> 00:06:16.040
...this high seas tournament isn't that simple.

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:17.240
I just heard something.

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:18.360
Don't worry.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:19.680
This time, I came...

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:20.959
...fully prepared.

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:22.480
Hello?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.639
Don't worry.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.079
They're all behaving.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.399
The exchange at the pier is soon.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:41.959
I can't believe they...

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.199
...are actually trafficking people.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.920
It's absolutely insane.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.680
We have to call the police and get them out.

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:54.600
Watch this.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.920
The last batch of girls was top-notch.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.040
Is this batch of goods ready?

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.680
Emergency tonight.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.439
Deal canceled.

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:24.360
Do not contact for now.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.959
If their ship goes back now...

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:32.439
...they'll be caught red-handed at the port.

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:34.000
The rest is up to the police.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.680
So that's it.

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.519
It actually helps me out.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:36.840
The deal is canceled.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.320
What should we do now?

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.320
What to do?

00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.440
If you want to live...

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.240
...leave the rest to me.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:52.480
Don't get involved.

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.240
Aren't you one of them?

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.879
Why should we trust you?

00:08:58.399 --> 00:08:59.000
Have you forgotten?

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.360
I saved you once before.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.320
So you can trust me.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.679
Because I'm a woman too.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.000
Boss Nan.

00:09:24.159 --> 00:09:24.720
Boss Nan!

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.320
Why are you wailing this early in the morning?

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:30.279
Boss Nan...

00:09:35.159 --> 00:09:36.279
B-B-Boss Nan...

00:09:36.399 --> 00:09:37.120
Something happened.

00:09:37.399 --> 00:09:37.879
The other side...

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.960
...canceled the deal.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.360
The pickup ship suddenly turned around.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.120
Since last night...

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.279
...we haven't been able to reach them.

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:44.360
This... this deal...

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:45.559
...is probably going down the drain.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.480
You useless idiots can't do anything right!

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.279
Today's match...

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.720
...you must win it for me.

00:09:55.879 --> 00:09:56.360
Get out!
