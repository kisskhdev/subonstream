watch closely.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.680
See if he's alone.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.980
Okay.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.920
I'll keep an eye out.

Calm down.

Daquan ran into a recycling station.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.500
He's holding a hostage.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.580
Shut up!

Where's the car?

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:08.990
It's on the way.

00:13:09.030 --> 00:13:09.950
Cut the crap!

00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:14.670
Call an ambulance!

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.730

I found something.

00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:58.920
There are over a dozen more boxes inside.

Is this everything?

00:14:05.390 --> 00:14:06.070
Yes.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.260
Liu, take photos here too.

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:32.930
Zhang Yan.

In the car.

Where's Ding Lai?

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:43.950
I don't know.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:45.810
I'm asking you. Where is Ding Lai?

00:14:46.430 --> 00:14:48.030
I've never even met Ding Lai.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:49.910
Ding Lai lives with Daquan.

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:51.110
You didn't know that?

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.150
Come down.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.670
Come down.

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:53.460
Come down.

Come down.

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.950
Don't.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.350
I heard from Quan

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.920
that they're meeting Ding Lai today.

00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:01.860
When?

00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:03.820
Right about now.

00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.450
What do you mean by "now"?

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:12.820
Now?

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.380
How many bags did that delivery guy have
when he went up?

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:19.790
One.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.340
When he came down,

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.670
why did he bring it down?

00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:32.380
Split up and chase him.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:32.910
Split up.

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:39.790
Hello.

00:15:40.030 --> 00:15:40.390
Police.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:41.550
Be gentle to my bike!

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.900
Pick it up at the PSB tomorrow.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:43.570
Hu Wenjing.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.250
Respond.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:48.910
Jin? Jin?

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.910
Find a way to contact them immediately.

00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:53.950
Be ready to provide backup.

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:54.790
Okay.

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:09.700
Do you hear me?

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:11.100
Jin Longzheng?

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:54.540
Ding Lai.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:16:56.550
What's up?

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.190
I am police.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.650
Please take off your mask.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.310
Sorry.

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:10.220
I can tell you that

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.109
we've been watching Han Qiang
for a long time.

00:17:13.109 --> 00:17:14.280
He has caused

00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.790
a loss of over two million yuan
to the Group.

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.950
But since he admitted his mistake,

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.130
we decided to keep him on probation

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:23.710
and not hand him over to the police.

00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:25.369
Over two million yuan?

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:27.250
It has nothing to do with me.

00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:27.859
I...

00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:29.260
I remember now.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.220
I reimbursed him

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.630
for over 80,000 yuan

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.770
in alcohol expenses once.

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:35.150
Just that one.

00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:36.010
That's enough.

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:37.480
Show him the evidence.

00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:02.460
This

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.310
doesn't prove anything.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:06.350
I told you

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.700
we're not the police.

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:09.230
You know exactly

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.520
what you did.

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.240
Don't come to work tomorrow.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.500
Go back to your department

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.870
and settle your severance pay.

00:18:19.910 --> 00:18:21.710
I just filed one invoice for him.

00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:23.980
I'm fired just because of this?

00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.640
We're just here to notify you.

00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.040
Do not make a scene.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.760
Or we'll call the police.

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.190
It's up to you.

00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:31.670
Think about it.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.190
Please, can you give me a chance?

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.620
I only did it this once.

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:43.430
I just took a sum of money.

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.630
I can pay it back.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.160
Let's just call the police.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.180
No!

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.680
I'll leave.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.100
I'll leave.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:00.130
Ding Lai!

00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.840
Ding Lai!

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.980
Ding Lai!

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:55.630
Ding Lai, stop!

00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:57.260
Police!

00:20:59.060 --> 00:20:59.670
Stop!

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.340
Stop or I'll shoot!

00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:11.390
Warning shot!

00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.060
Ding Lai!

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:20.590
Come out.

00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.020
Next time, it won't be a warning.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.110
Jin Longzheng!

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:34.460
Jin Longzheng!

00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:54.180
Ding Lai!

00:29:19.790 --> 00:29:20.650
Jin Longzheng!

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.700
Don't move.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:29.780
He ran over there.

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:30.870
Which way?

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:31.540
That way.

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:33.320
Go after him.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:34.430
No. No.

00:29:35.770 --> 00:29:36.830
Chase him!

00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:37.780
Leave me alone.

00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:39.220
You'll die if I leave you.

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.670
Don't move.

00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:42.830
Don't move.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:43.740
Get him.

00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:47.740
It's okay.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.350
No more chasing.

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:50.700
When you recover,

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:52.110
you catch him yourself.

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:54.710
Please.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:56.160
You go catch him.

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.730
Catch him.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:00.300
Don't move.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.420
Take small breaths.

00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.280
Jin Longzheng,

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:03.190
can you hear me?

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:04.050
Small breaths.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:06.830
Zhang Yan,

00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:07.830
where are you?

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.870
Hurry!

00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:10.420
At our last position.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:11.670
Jin Longzheng is injured.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.350
Hurry!

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:13.500
Okay.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.420
Jin Longzheng,

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.110
don't fall asleep.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.970
Jin Longzheng?

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:23.900
Jin Longzheng?

00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:24.690
Look at me.

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.840
Jin Longzheng.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.020
It's okay.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:29.590
Jin Longzheng, don't fall asleep.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:30.450
Jin Longzheng!

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:31.840
Jin Longzheng!

00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:17.790
What's taking so long?

00:31:21.390 --> 00:31:22.310
Hurry up.

00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:39.510
