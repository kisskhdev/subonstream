WEBVTT

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.640
I told you

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.170
not to walk around.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:19.590
I'm sorry.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.160
I didn't mean to see this.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.700
Hyung.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:39.680
Let's talk.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.940
Hyung, let's talk.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.570
No need.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.730
Now,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.680
I'm going to teach you what you should do.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.250
That's right.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000
You should've been a good boy like this.

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.930
I can't do it anymore.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.140
I'm sorry.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.990
I didn't mean it.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.260
Maybe I'm afraid

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:05.920
of losing you.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.730
Especially when I saw you
hugging that teddy bear

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.200
looking at the photo,

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.660
I was afraid

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.350
you would leave me
after knowing everything about me—

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.310
just like that woman did.

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.180
I can't handle

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.980
being abandoned again, Haejun.

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.080
Really.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.280
Tell me about your past.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.390
I won't leave you

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.630
because you were once injured.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:06.260
I won't leave you after knowing

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.530
your sad past.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.360
But

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.380
if you continue to keep it to yourself

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.480
and hurt me as a way to vent
your fear,

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.790
our relationship won't last long.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.290
I'll try to understand all your pain.

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:38.870
So...

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:42.280
You should also...

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:48.560
think about how

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:52.690
we can get rid of this fear together.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.330
That teddy bear...

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.230
was a Christmas gift
from my mom when I was young.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.510
She said even if she wasn't by my side,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.690
the teddy bear would always be with me.

00:08:21.470 --> 00:08:22.440
After that,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.580
my mother couldn't handle
the domestic violence anymore

00:08:35.299 --> 00:08:36.650
and ran away from home.

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:41.159
I should be happy for her.

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.500
Then I went to look for my father,

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.080
really wanting to kill him,

00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.040
carrying this teddy bear.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.620
I cried and shouted,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.150
asking him where my mom went.

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:00.870
But my father

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.710
threw the teddy bear into the trash can

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.690
and locked me in the attic.

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.620
The appearance of the teddy bear...

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.110
No.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.480
Your appearance

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.510
makes me feel like
I've found the teddy bear again.

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:27.980
So I want to keep you by my side.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.060
I don't want to lose you.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.080
I'm afraid of being alone again, Haejun.

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.630
I'm afraid you'll leave me like my mom

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.000
after knowing everything.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.850
I don't want to taste failure again

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.170
through that bear.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:09:59.920
You're wrong.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.980
You are like this...

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.310
only because you've never been loved.

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.940
Let's learn together.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.670
I won't leave you.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:19.410
But...

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.630
if you want to
shoulder that suffering alone...

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:52.920
Let me

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:54.090
untie you.

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:55.790
No.

00:10:58.010 --> 00:10:58.720
It's okay.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.170
I'll keep wearing it

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.730
until you've recovered.

00:11:09.420 --> 00:11:11.660
Until you learn how to love,

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.970
I will be wearing it.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.440
Take it as a token of our love.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:22.520
Keep it.

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.200
Promise.

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.570
[I already know Jaehun's past.
Thank you, Soohyuk. I'll help him
get rid of his childhood trauma.]

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:52.420
[I already know Jaehun's past.
Thank you, Soohyuk. I'll help him
get rid of his childhood trauma.]

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.760
Kim Haejun.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:01.710
So you've found out?

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.690
And you want to help him with it?

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.810
How naive.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:42.120
Hey, Jaehun.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:44.370
Let's have a drink.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:12:58.060
You're here.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.120
I came because you told me
something important came up.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.740
Shoot.

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:20.400
I need to go back.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.730
Why?

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.320
Are you going back
to take care of Kim Haejun?

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.530
You used to stay up all night and drink.

00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.580
You just got here and
you're thinking about leaving already?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:32.040
Jaehun.

00:13:32.970 --> 00:13:34.700
Do you know what you've become?

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:36.620
You're completely bound by him.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:39.900
Who knows

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.530
who's the one being bound?

00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.090
How confident.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.070
I really want to see

00:13:50.170 --> 00:13:51.170
when you are down.

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.610
Just imagine it.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.100
By the way,

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:07.870
a few days ago,

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.130
Yoon Minwoo called me.

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.700
He's now a certified physiotherapist.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.220
He majored in architecture,

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:19.690
[Physiotherapist Yoon Minwoo]

00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:21.840
but now he's suddenly a physiotherapist.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.800
I asked him why,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.400
but he didn't answer.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.600
Could it be...

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.240
for you?

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.620
You studied architecture,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:35.480
so he followed.

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.000
He heard you have a mental illness,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
so he got trained in physiotherapy.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:41.390
He's so loyal.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.400
I don't understand why he's so annoying.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.760
But you two know each other well.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:54.130
Isn't that better?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.130
Given your state recently,

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:58.270
you need someone by your side

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.630
to take care of you.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.100
It's better than
looking for another doctor out there.

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.690
Especially since

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.330
you're so out of focus lately.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.840
Okay.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.850
I'll contact him.

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:10.530
You're back.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.480
I came back quickly, right?

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:13.920
Yes.

00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:18.960
I need to finish reading this book.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.470
This is tomorrow's assignment.

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:22.760
No.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.770
Why would someone asleep
be reading?

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.280
Read it tomorrow.

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:27.620
Okay?

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.280
Reading at night is bad for your eyes.

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:34.670
More importantly,

00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:37.140
if you're not sleepy,

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.940
shall we do something fun?

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:40.830
I'm sleepy.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.950
Gosh.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:46.300
Okay.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:55.430
Good night, my baby.

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:56.680
I'm going to take a shower.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:57.010
Okay.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:20.990
[Physiotherapist,
Yoon Minwoo]

00:17:22.910 --> 00:17:23.589
Oh, right.

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.180
A few days ago,

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:26.440
Yoon Minwoo called me.

00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:31.240
He's now a certified physiotherapist.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.510
I gave him your business card.

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:15.460
Okay.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:15.940
But...

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:19.330
why don't you go to him yourself?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:21.380
You keep making me the messenger.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:23.550
Minwoo.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.660
When are you going to change that habit?

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.450
If you like him, go after him yourself.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.310
How many years has it been?

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.010
Is this love?

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:38.340
Yes.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.140
Are you...

00:18:41.090 --> 00:18:41.640
shy?

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:43.880
No.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.450
I just

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:49.750
don't know on what grounds

00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.700
I should meet him

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.210
as.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:00.800
Jaehun is a good person.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:03.790
Can I

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:06.280
be with him?

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.460
I've known him for so long.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.810
But I've never gotten tired of him.

00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:19.160
Then

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.290
go to him.

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.310
Isn't he the person you want the most?

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.070
He needs help now.

00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:29.980
And you're an expert.

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:32.940
Is there a better reason than that?

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:35.740
You're just like that

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.270
just because of Kim Haejun.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:39.990
From what I can see,

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.840
Kim Haejun is just a toy

00:19:42.150 --> 00:19:43.550
he fell momentarily for.

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.030
He'll get sick of it sooner or later.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.020
Your friendship of over 20 years

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.070
is stronger than that.

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:25.990
Kang Soohyung.

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:28.890
You're right.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.050
This is an opportunity.

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.380
I won't miss out

00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:39.450
on this opportunity.

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:42.660
Nice.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.820
I'm looking forward

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:47.530
to how it will turn out.

00:21:26.090 --> 00:21:28.220
What kind of sleeping posture is this?

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:18.710
Am I dreaming?

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:22.330
Yes.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.990
You're dreaming.

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:35.640
Yes, you're dreaming.

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.520
What are you doing?

00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:32.330
I'm hanging this up.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:34.150
This is mistletoe.

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.200
A mistletoe?

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.610
What's that?

00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:41.160
Is it a plant?

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:43.130
This is a plant

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.590
you hang up on Christmas.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:48.920
Legend has it that couples
who kiss under it

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:51.270
will be together forever.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:56.750
Then,

00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.000
what if I do it this way?

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.230
You learn so quickly.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:16.520
Well,

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.230
unlike a certain bad student.

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:22.010
Are you mocking me?

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.160
No.

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:26.820
You're going to hang this up?

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.370
Do you want me to carry you?

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.820
Yes.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.360
One.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:34.840
Two.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:35.280
Three.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.420
It is said that

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.840
lovers can ask for kisses

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.800
under the mistletoe.

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.680
I am asking

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:57.700
for a kiss.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.740
I won't refuse.

00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:20.450
You are...

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:23.120
Hello.

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:25.480
I'm a physiotherapist.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:27.880
Is Jaehun here?

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.840
Physiotherapist?

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.150
Jaehun.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:41.410
Why did you suddenly become
a physiotherapist?

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:42.400
Come in, Minwoo.

00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:42.730
Okay.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.780
What's going on?

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:55.310
I'm getting some treatment.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:57.070
I need to get well soon

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:58.880
so that I won't hurt you more.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:00.620
Will you be fine?

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.830
Are you worried about me?

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.240
I'll take care of myself.

00:27:13.460 --> 00:27:14.350
My baby.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:16.950
Okay.

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.790
As long as your body is fine.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.520
Just my body?

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.170
Yes, just your body.

00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:22.990
Don't worry. I'll go for my treatment.

00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.260
Okay.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:24.660
-Call me anytime.
-Okay.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:47.530
Your muscles are very tight.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:51.440
Are you under a lot of stress recently?

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:52.660
Or do you have

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.520
bad sleeping habits?

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:58.370
Maybe I haven't been sleeping well.

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:02.520
I heard you refused the marriage
arranged by your family.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:04.660
Your dad is quite angry.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:08.900
She seems nice.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.460
We met a few times before.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.430
Are you here to be a matchmaker?

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:19.670
No.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:20.980
I just

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:23.610
hope

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.850
you can meet someone

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.400
who suits you better.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:38.850
Leave me alone.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:41.310
Just worry about your own marriage.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.040
Was that your new bed partner?

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:47.310
He looks young.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.280
Is he a student?

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.140
That's very different

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:54.340
from your past partners.

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:59.160
Do you remember when you were younger?

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:00.890
I was worried

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.800
your dad would scold you,

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.710
so I'd say I'm staying for dinner.

00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:09.850
That's right.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.750
Back then, in my dad's eyes

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:15.360
you were just a beggar who'd always

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:16.890
come for meals at our place.

00:29:19.870 --> 00:29:21.540
But thankfully I was around.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.270
Since then,

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.050
I thought of

00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:30.370
protecting you

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.000
as my duty.

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:36.790
Even now too.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.350
No matter what happens,

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.640
I will be by your side.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:47.680
Okay.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:48.900
Thank you.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:11.730
It's over?

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:11.990
Yes.

00:30:30.550 --> 00:30:31.480
Have a good rest.

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.640
I'll come again

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:34.240
next time.

00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.200
See you next time.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:55.580
Wow.

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:56.520
My artist.

00:30:56.910 --> 00:30:58.280
You've improved a lot.

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:00.090
Hyung,

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.990
are you making fun of me?

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:04.900
By the way,

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.640
the person who just left
is called Yoon Minwoo, right?

00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:10.640
What's your relationship with him?

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.050
Minwoo and I

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.980
are neighbors and friends.

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.410
We grew up together.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:22.620
We just got in touch recently.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:26.860
I heard he's an expert,
so I'm receiving treatment from him.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.310
I see.

00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.610
But

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.450
the way he looks at me is different.

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:34.630
Are you hiding something from me?

00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:38.530
We've been friends since childhood.

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.270
We grew up together.

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.020
We just got in touch recently.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.810
He's an expert,
so I'm receiving treatment from him.

00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:46.200
That's all.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:50.780
As long as

00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.440
it's good for you,
everything's great.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.780
When you're having classes,
I can call him over

00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.040
and introduce you two.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:31:59.800
How's that?

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:00.930
I don't want that.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:01.800
Me neither.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.010
What is this?

00:32:13.930 --> 00:32:14.960
I just bought it.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.690
The previous one

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:18.800
was too heavy

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.660
and too exposed. I didn't like it.

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.360
I don't even feel this one.

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.050
Your name

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.620
is on the necklace too.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.350
Thank you.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.970
Kiss me if you're thankful.
