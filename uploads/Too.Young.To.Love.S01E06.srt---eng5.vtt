[Too Young To Love]

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.270
[Episode 6]

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.840
Open your books to page 248.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.460
Let's look at question 17.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
15 points.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.500
It's a freebie.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.280
Just memorize it.

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.229
Mr. Bu.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.720
Mr. Bu, I have a question too.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.400
Figure it out yourself.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.710
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.150
Sorry. The subscriber you dialed
is powered off.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.490
Don't worry about Tong.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.590
He promised emphatically

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.120
he'd definitely show up
for tonight's band performance.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.520
If we do well this time,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.250
we might be able to perform there
regularly for the next few months.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:28.710
You really think you can become a star?

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.829
[You really think you can become a star?]

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:30.520
[Look at you. You're nowhere near
as good-looking as my idol.]

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.680
Look at you.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.690
You're nowhere near as good-looking
as my idol.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.630
We're an independent band.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.120
We're nothing like your idol,
who's just famous for his face.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.520
How about this?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.470
Well,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.240
I'll go to the office
and photocopy the study materials for you.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.910
Okay?

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.870
Then you guys behave yourselves.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.870
Don't run around.

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:52.750
Be good.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.410
Wait for me to come back.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:10.150
Come in.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.120
Mr. Bu.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.680
My stomach hurts a bit.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.530
Can I skip the next self-study class
and go home?

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.690
Is it because you're worried
about Tong Xiaole?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.430
That's part of it,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.079
but my stomach really does hurt.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.870
I don't have any medicine

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.800
for a stomachache.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.680
However,

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.800
I specially prepared some study materials
just for you.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.630
Specially?

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.240
Yes.

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.430
For me?

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.190
Yes.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.470
Because you're my most promising student.

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:50.079
Most promising?

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.750
So just go back

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.310
for the next self-study class.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.360
As for Tong Xiaole,

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.520
I'll contact him.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.079
Okay.

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:57.520
Go back now.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.360
Okay.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.910
Mr. Bu, I won't let you down.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.470
Good.

Chen Fan.

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.240
What's wrong?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.750
Mr. Bu, my throat...

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.240
Is it also because you're worried
about Tong Xiaole?

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.480
Here.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.870
I really don't have any medicine

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.870
for a sore throat.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:31.680
However,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.430
I specially prepared some study materials
just for you.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.190
Specially?

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.800
Yes.

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.560
Because you're my most promising student.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.490
Most promising?

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.920
Yes.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.590
Just go back
for the next self-study class.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.560
Thank you, Mr. Bu.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.750
I'll definitely study hard.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:45.190
Good.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.100
Why haven't you come to class yet?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.159
It's already noon.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.990

Hello.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.240
Xiaole, you finally answered!

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.570
We were all worried sick
because you didn't come to school.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.630
I'm fine.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.310
I just overslept.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.120
Don't forget the band performance
at 7 PM tonight.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.240
I'll wait for you at the venue
after class.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:10.750
Okay.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.680
I got it.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.480
It's still early.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.080
Don't worry. I won't be late.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.630
Dad, why are you back?

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.120
Why are you at home?

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.450
You didn't go to school?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.430
Dad, I have something urgent.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:24.360
I'm heading out.

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:25.120
What kind of urgent matter
is more important

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.310
than going to school?

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.310
Do you realize you are skipping class?

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:29.120
Get inside!

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.680
What kind of attitude is that?

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.810
Apologize to Mr. Bu.

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.240
I'm sorry, Mr. Bu.

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.120
I overslept.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.750
You overslept?

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:49.120
You made so many people worry about you!

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.120
And I even rushed back from out of town.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.120
How can you be so thoughtless?

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:54.120
Mr. Tong.

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.680
Well,

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.800
as long as Xiaole is fine,
that's all that matters.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.240
Kids at this age

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.430
are quite rebellious.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.360
Just talk to him calmly.

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.890
Alright.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.560
I'm leaving first.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.120
Okay.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.240
It's fine.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.800
Take care.

[Pre-filled College Application

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.800
Explain yourself.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.560
Why didn't you fill it in?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.750
Didn't I tell you to choose Finance?

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.120
If I hadn't come back this time,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.070
I wouldn't have known
you did something so ridiculous!

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.630
You were not even at home.

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:25.310
Who was I supposed to ask?

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.360
Couldn't you have called?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.240
Like you ever answer your phone?

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.920
Fine.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120
You don't want to choose Finance.

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.450
Then tell me
what major you want to choose.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:38.310
Okay.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.560
Since you don't have a major
of your choice,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.960
you must choose Finance.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.750
Why should I listen to you?

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.240
Because I'm your father!

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.920
You must do what I say!

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.250
Choose Finance, right?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.000
You want me to choose Finance.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.240
Isn't it just because you want me
to become like you,

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.190
spending every single day chasing money?

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:58.120
Is that how you talk to your father?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.000
You ungrateful brat!

Are you okay?

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.730
I've been looking for you all day.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.909
Sir,

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.870
I'm begging you.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:34.789
My partner isn't here yet.

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.240
This performance is very important to me.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:37.320
It's important to everyone!

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.669
Can't you see everyone's already waiting?

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:39.789
Just give me a little more time, please.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.630
No! Let go!

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.750

Microphone.

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.670
Give it to me.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.200
Alright, just go.

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.320
Honestly, your dad is really something.

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.390
He's way out of line!

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.670
It's bad enough
that he usually doesn't care about you.

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:25.550
Now he's deciding everything for you!

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:27.320
What's wrong with asking him to come back?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.440
He got to have you without any pain,

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.320
and raise you without any effort.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.390
That's just not right!

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:31.670
How can he get such a free ride?

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:32.730
Don't you think so?

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.200
All right.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.330
Stay out of my business. Just go home.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.030
You're always meddling in my business.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:42.160
Now I can't have a say in your business?

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.150
You didn't come to school today.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:46.880
I was worried about you all day.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.670
What's there to worry about?

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:53.960
I just overslept.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.200
About your major,

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.800
what's in your mind?

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.030
Tell me.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.600
If someone really important to you

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.530
has all these expectations of you,

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.790
then you have to live up
to their expectations

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:14.320
until you leave this world.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:17.150
Is a life like that even meaningful?

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:18.790
How is it not meaningful?

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.570
Living itself is meaningful.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.440
Your existence is meaningful to me.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:26.150
You are the grand prize in my life.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.200
I promise I won't leave you.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.050
You are really important to me.

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.480
You are very useful!

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:21.200
Useful for what?

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.880
You...

00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:26.960
You...

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.030
You...

00:26:31.550 --> 00:26:32.830
Your family's villa is very useful.

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.550
You know I care about you!

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.740
Then why were you late on purpose?

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:44.150
I had a fight with my dad that day.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:50.790
Why didn't you tell me
something so important?

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.850
I also care a lot...

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:53.600
about...

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:55.560
your issues.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.400
I care about you too!

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.640
Chen Fan!

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.310
Xiaole!

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:17.110
Tong Xiaole, you didn't even wait
for me today!

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.710
Good morning, everyone.

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:21.240
You two are good now?

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:22.480
What are you talking about?

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.790
When did we ever fall out?

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:24.550
Never.

00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:25.550
Let's go.

00:27:31.350 --> 00:27:32.240
Men...

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:33.720
So complicated.

00:27:51.070 --> 00:27:51.720
Shan.

00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:53.000
What's up?

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.200
You seem distracted.

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.070
Nothing.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.510
I've got a teacher for you.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:02.310
When will you start practicing?

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:06.680
I haven't convinced my dad yet.

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.110
He still doesn't agree.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.310
Still doesn't agree?

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:13.110
Your dad is just...

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.640
How about...

00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:22.350
I go talk to him?

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:23.240
You'll go?

00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.510
Sure.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:29.850
When will you go?

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:33.480
Today, I...

00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:34.200
Tonight!

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.030
Tonight?

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.880
I've made up my mind.

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:40.880
Don't bring it up again.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.640
Please, allow me.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.000
Let me do it.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:43.400
Mr. Yi.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:49.030
Yi Lan

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.070
has been going to your place a lot lately.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:52.070
Sorry for the trouble.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:53.070
No trouble at all.

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.650
I like hearing Lan play the cello too.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.130
It always reminds me of my mentor.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.030
Your mentor...

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:12.070
She put all her time and energy

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.240
into the cello.

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:19.750
She sacrificed everything
to pursue her dream.

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:39.160
So,

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.200
I don't want Lan

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.230
to end up like her mother.

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:48.550
Have some tea.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:49.740
Thanks, Mr. Yi.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.520
I understand.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:55.510
But...

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.640
But don't you think...

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.830
that now you're

00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:03.590
not so different

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.840
from how my mentor used to be?

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:09.400
When Yi Lan was little,

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.640
my mentor forced her
to practice the cello.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.510
Now she has grown up,

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:14.750
and you won't let her practice the cello.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.550
She's like a fish in your tank.

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:17.790
She eats

00:30:17.790 --> 00:30:18.510
whatever you feed her.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.310
Do you really think she's happy?

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:25.070
Mr. Yi.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.700
Lately, Lan has been going to my place

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.790
to practice the cello
every day after school.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.450
Come and see when you're free.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.720
Shan.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.880
How did it go?

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.110
How did what go?

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:52.240
Did he agree?

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.550
Focus on your cello classes first.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.550
We'll talk about it later.

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:57.920
Go in.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.550
Did he agree or not?

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.360
We'll discuss it later.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:13.590
Lan, you're back.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.860
I made braised pork for you today.

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:17.270
Dad.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.400
Why won't you agree?

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:22.830
Let's talk after dinner,

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:23.550
okay?

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.480
All you ever do is cook for me.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.930
You're afraid I'll end up like Mom,

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:29.170
aren't you?

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.950
After Mom left,
you never even mention her.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.130
And now you won't let me play the cello.

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.550
Is it because in your heart,

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.480
you no longer have a place for my mom?

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.550
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:31:40.550 --> 00:31:43.000
There was nothing wrong
with Mom chasing her dream!

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.030
And there is nothing wrong
with me loving music.

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:46.430
Whether you agree or not,

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.280
I'm going to play the cello.

00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:49.960
I will prove it to you.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.880
It's about Yi Lan, isn't it?

00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:11.400
Yes.

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.070
Lan's father is stubborn.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:17.640
It will take some time to persuade him.

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:19.110
Oh, right.

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.010
I haven't paid for Lan's lessons yet,
right?

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.790
Don't worry about it.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:24.160
The teacher happens
to be a friend of mine.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.620
We can talk about it later.

00:32:25.790 --> 00:32:26.880
That won't do.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.690
How can I let her take lessons
without paying?

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.790
Tell me how much it is,

00:32:31.790 --> 00:32:33.320
and I'll transfer it to you.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:35.860
How about this?

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.750
I'll ask the teacher to contact you,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.680
and you two can settle it directly.

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:41.170
That works too.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:42.960
I'm leaving now.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.000
Okay, rest early.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:32:59.790
Xiaole,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.200
call me back when you have a moment.

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.550
We're out of town
dealing with something urgent.

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:06.550
We'll stay here for a few extra days.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.960
About choosing your major,

00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.200
if there's really no major
you have your heart set on,

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.060
consider your dad's suggestion.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.400
Got it.

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:37.400
I hope Mr. Tong can love Xiaole more.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.200
I'd give Xiaole
half of my dad's love for me.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:04.110
Sweetie,

00:34:04.550 --> 00:34:06.310
could you take a break
from practicing today?

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:07.640
You've been practicing for too long.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.040
Don't wear yourself out.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:11.480
I've made your favorite dish.

00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.340
I'm not eating!

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.760
It's your favorite!

00:34:31.590 --> 00:34:33.920
How did you know
I hadn't eaten dinner yet?

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:49.070
Red phoenix. Red phoenix.

00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:54.630
Pink phoenix. Pink...
Colorful phoenix. Pink phoenix.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.440
Mr. Yi,

00:34:55.550 --> 00:34:57.070
just got back
from dropping your son off at school?

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:57.760
Come on,

00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.710
let's play a couple rounds.

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:59.640
A couple rounds.

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.670
Your daughter's

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:02.760
voice...

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:04.280
She sounds amazing.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.590
Come on.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.150
Of course.

00:35:07.710 --> 00:35:08.970
With a voice like that,

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.110
she's gonna be on TV someday!

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:14.360
TV?

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.440
What's wrong with that?

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.400
Impressive.

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.230
I see your daughter playing

00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:20.030
the cello or whatever every day.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.510
Is she planning
to take the art exam too?

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.510
That's a tough path to take.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.150
Don't worry.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.550
Back in the day, her mom

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:30.000
was the top student in the cello major.

00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:32.000
If my daughter wants to take the art exam,

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.880
it'll be a piece of cake!

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:35.410
Let me tell you.

00:35:35.710 --> 00:35:36.880
Time is running out.

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.960
For the art exam,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:40.280
everyone is already getting
private tutors.

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.760
Your daughter still goes
to regular school every day.

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.190
You think she can make it?

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.400
Mr. Yi,

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.670
it seems like

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.840
you don't care

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.550
about your daughter at all.

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:51.760
Come on,

00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:53.220
another round.

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:55.110
I need to take this call.

00:35:55.110 --> 00:35:55.970
Another round.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:00.070
Such a sore loser.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.070
Shan.

00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:08.040
Do you still remember
what my mom looked like?

00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.030
I do.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.710
Although

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.800
my memory of her face

00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:16.400
is already blurry,

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.000
I always feel

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.840
that if she were still here,

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.230
she would definitely support me

00:36:22.230 --> 00:36:23.760
in doing what I want to do.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:24.800
Your dad

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:27.990
really shouldn't stop you
from playing the cello.

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:29.000
He probably

00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:31.280
hasn't made peace with himself yet.

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:32.940
You need to give him some time.

00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.360
But you're the one

00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:38.630
who decides your own life.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:41.090
It has nothing to do
with your mom or your dad.

00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:43.790
So you really need
to think about it carefully.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:18.230
Xiaole!

00:37:25.070 --> 00:37:26.400
Xiaole!

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.110
My dad agreed to let me take the art exam!
