WEBVTT

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.662
We're almost there, ma'am.

00:02:03.998 --> 00:02:08.503
What was supposed to be a two-hour drive
turned out to be a three-hour trip.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:12.799
But it's okay.

00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:18.096
When you leave your old life behind,
you don't have to rush.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:25.520
How do you start a new life,
when you feel dead inside?

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.314
I don't have a choice.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:32.777
Ma'am, I already told your father
that you’ve arrived.

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:35.112
Thanks, Kuya Rick. Take care.

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.363
Let me help you with your things.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:37.323
I can handle this.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:38.323
Okay.

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:42.452
I really need to start over.

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:43.705
A clean slate.

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:44.681
Oh!

00:02:44.776 --> 00:02:45.840
Lorelei!

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.543
I've been waiting for you for a while.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:50.262
Tita Martha.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.257
I think I was still in grade school
the last time I vacationed here.

00:02:54.674 --> 00:02:58.386
Wow, Lorelei, you’re all grown up now.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.597
You can just call me Lori.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.725
Lori! Oh!

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:07.896
Good thing Tita Martha is here.

00:03:08.104 --> 00:03:09.146
She's Mama's cousin.

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:10.147
Wait.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:11.426
Why...

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.285
did your Dad leave so soon?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.610
Too bad...

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.447
I haven't seen Walter in ages.

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.949
He didn't come along.

00:03:20.407 --> 00:03:21.408
The thing is...

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:24.161
he had an important meeting earlier.

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:25.913
Oh, is that so?

00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:28.541
But he really wants to see you, Tita.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:33.296
He said I should check in on you for him.

00:03:36.007 --> 00:03:38.717
We better go inside

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:41.011
so you can see your unit, okay?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.722
- I’ve really prepared everything. Come on.
- Sure.

00:03:43.723 --> 00:03:46.850
Alright. Come, grab your stuff. Let's go.

00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:48.936
Of course, that was a lie.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.527
But Tita Martha doesn’t have to know.

Almost everyone living here is a student.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:01.551
Especially those from far away.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:07.056
Because you can literally just walk
from here to Clark U.

00:05:07.598 --> 00:05:09.099
This place is really packed.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.268
You just don’t notice because it’s quiet.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:12.936
It's because all they focus on,

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:16.773
you know,
is computers and laptops, right?

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:17.774
Ouch.

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:19.152
Are you okay?

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.070
It's heavy.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:25.491
That's what I wanted to ask, actually.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:28.703
Are you okay sharing the unit
with someone else?

00:05:29.704 --> 00:05:30.704
What?

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:39.380
Since all the units are already full...

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:41.965
You have your own room,

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.885
you just have a common area.

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:47.513
You know, the kitchen,
bathroom, living room.

00:05:47.764 --> 00:05:49.932
I think it’s okay for us to share.

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.185
We’re both girls, anyway.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.686
He’s a guy, though.

00:05:58.149 --> 00:06:01.110
Your dad told me...

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.572
about what happened to you
at your old school.

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:09.285
I'm really sorry that happened to you.
I'm really sorry, okay?

00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:17.293
But trust me, alright?
Nothing bad will happen to you.

00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:23.508
This time,
you have a different kind of roommate.

00:06:24.258 --> 00:06:26.010
He's not like other guys.

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.179
How is he different?

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.851
- He's really quiet.
- Ah.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:36.562
It's like you have a roommate
that's like...

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:39.272
a stone.

00:06:40.441 --> 00:06:42.026
He's mysterious.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.904
And most importantly,

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:48.491
he's not interested in girls.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:51.202
Maybe he likes guys?

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:53.996
Guys?

00:06:57.625 --> 00:06:59.919
He has no interest in anyone.

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.004
Whether it's a girl or a guy.

00:07:02.422 --> 00:07:07.093
Because in the two years he’s lived here,
I don’t remember him ever bringing

00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:09.679
a friend or classmate over.

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:11.680
And I think,

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:15.685
maybe you just rarely get the chance
to see or talk to each other.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:19.981
Because that’s what
his previous roommates told me too.

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:25.153
Who were his old roommates
and why did they leave?

00:07:25.903 --> 00:07:28.156
He never had a roommate who stayed long.

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.992
But he’s not the one
being complained about.

00:07:31.492 --> 00:07:33.077
The stories vary.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:36.080
They say there's a ghost.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.707
Or they sense something else.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:42.211
But if you ask Loki,

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.255
he says there's no ghost.

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:47.300
That’s why he’s able to stay
by himself for so long.

00:07:47.592 --> 00:07:48.592
Right?

00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:51.429
So, it's nothing, right?

00:07:53.097 --> 00:07:54.390
Let's go inside?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.766
Alright.

00:07:58.603 --> 00:07:59.937
Loki?

00:08:02.356 --> 00:08:03.649
Loki!

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.739
Maybe he didn't hear us. Wait.

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.369
We're coming inside, okay?

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.746
Let's go in.

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:25.880
Oh, Loki. You’ve just been sitting there.
Your new roommate is here.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.258
Here's your common area,
this is the living room.

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:33.638
Hi.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:35.097
I'm Lorelei Rios.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:41.187
Loki Mendez.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.189
Pleased to meet you.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.899
I'm in the middle
of solving a puzzle here.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.319
Can you not disturb me
for another five minutes?

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:53.533
Isn't he nice?

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:56.994
I warned you earlier.

00:08:57.203 --> 00:08:58.663
But he’s really nice.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:03.334
Come on.
Let me take you to your room. Okay?

00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:05.628
Come, I'll go with you.

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:06.711
Right here.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.420
Here are the extra pillows and blanket.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:52.717
You can arrange the room however you like.

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.387
Here's your key card for the main door.

00:09:58.681 --> 00:10:01.601
And here's your key for the bathroom.

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:03.311
And this is for the room.

00:10:06.063 --> 00:10:07.857
If you need anything, anything at all,

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:11.485
just come to my unit, unit 101.

00:10:11.902 --> 00:10:13.821
Sure. Thank you, Tita.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:19.869
Tell your dad to visit every now and then,

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:23.456
so he won’t miss his only daughter
too much.

00:10:34.717 --> 00:10:36.344
Alright, I'll go ahead, okay?

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:25.493
Gab: Lori, why aren't you enlisted anymore?

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.829
Gab: Aren't you going
to enroll at St. Barth?

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.707
Che: Lori, what happened? Please reply.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:34.878
AJ: I heard about what happened.
You okay, girl??

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:40.885
Meg: I'm so sorry that happened to you.

00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:59.278
Should I talk to him?

00:13:00.321 --> 00:13:01.781
But he's reading,

00:13:02.323 --> 00:13:03.449
he might get disturbed.

00:13:06.076 --> 00:13:07.953
Your glances are making me uncomfortable.

00:13:08.704 --> 00:13:11.916
Oh, no. Did he read my mind?

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:17.004
Or, wait.
Maybe I'm not the one he's talking to.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.465
Is there anything you want to ask me?

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:22.217
Well...

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:24.887
I appreciate the silence between us.

00:13:25.429 --> 00:13:27.765
But I don't mind getting to know you.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.894
I mean, we're living under the same roof.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:34.605
It's better
if we get to know each other first.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.980
I mean...

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.660
we still don't know anything
about each other.

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.236
Oh, I disagree.

00:13:42.285 --> 00:13:43.494
Excuse me?

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.491
You're from Manila.

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.583
You decided to transfer here

00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:50.878
possibly to study at Clark University.

00:13:51.337 --> 00:13:53.548
- Did Tita Martha tell you that?
- Nope!

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:56.836
I deduced it based on how you dress.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.506
An all-black outfit
may be a fad in Manila,

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:01.757
but not here.

00:14:02.132 --> 00:14:03.884
The tags in your luggage show

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:07.638
that you travelled to and from Manila,
probably for leisure.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.892
You got all that information
from my clothes and my bags?

00:14:12.351 --> 00:14:13.978
People are like books.

00:14:14.478 --> 00:14:16.063
I like reading books.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:20.693
And if my hunch is correct...

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:24.113
you’re running away
from something in Manila.

00:14:25.322 --> 00:14:28.576
That’s why you’re looking
for peace and quiet in this faraway place.

00:14:35.416 --> 00:14:36.416
Don't worry,

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:39.003
Mrs. Henson didn't tell me anything.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.130
But even if she did,

00:14:42.423 --> 00:14:43.591
I wasn't listening.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.801
But tell me,

00:14:46.677 --> 00:14:47.677
am I right?

00:14:49.513 --> 00:14:51.306
How did you know
I was running away from something?

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:53.100
You ignored your friends' messages.

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:56.937
Disconnecting from people
is a form of social withdrawal

00:14:57.187 --> 00:14:59.105
where one pulls away
from friends and activities

00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:00.441
linked to stress and anxiety.

00:15:01.775 --> 00:15:03.152
You want to run away from them.

00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:05.821
Or forget them.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.325
- How did you know...
- I saw it on my way from the bathroom.

00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:12.161
Your screen's brightness was on full.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:14.330
It's hard not to notice.

00:15:16.081 --> 00:15:17.374
Why didn't you reply to them?

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:19.459
I wonder.

00:15:19.835 --> 00:15:22.295
They were so concerned about you.

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:22.838
Oh, my God.

00:15:22.839 --> 00:15:24.840
You're reading my messages?

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:28.260
What was that incident
you're running away from?

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:30.137
What are you trying to escape from?

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:32.639
Did something happen at your old school?

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.390
Enough.

00:15:33.391 --> 00:15:34.934
Looks like your family's well-off

00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:39.355
and there a lot of prestigious schools
that you could transfer to in Manila.

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:40.439
I can see three scenarios.

00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:41.565
Stop.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:45.526
First, you witnessed a crime.

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:46.278
Enough.

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:50.115
Second, you were involved in a scandal.

00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:51.991
And, third...

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:53.285
I said, enough!

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:14.932
I thought that when I got here,
I'd be able to forget those things.

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:26.777
But all it took was this weird guy
showing off his people-reading skills.

00:16:26.986 --> 00:16:29.613
What if I tell him to Tita Martha?

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:32.657
But, no.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:34.618
That would be childish.

00:16:34.827 --> 00:16:36.370
What am I, in high school?

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:45.004
Tomorrow, my new life begins
as a Journalism major at Clark University.

00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:47.714
That's what I need to focus on.

00:16:47.715 --> 00:16:48.715
Right, Mom?

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:08.193
I know that even if you're not here,

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.404
that's what you'd tell me.

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.115
I want to make you proud of me.

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:26.670
It's great that your nickname "Ley"
is also the old German word for "rock."’.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:29.757
And you are my rock, Mom.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.179
I can get through this as long as I carry
the memory of your love with me...

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.532
Hi!

00:18:36.573 --> 00:18:40.369
There's a freshmen orientation.
Please come.

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:41.911
Thanks, but I'm a transferee.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:46.625
Oh, sorry. Welcome to Clark University!

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:47.918
Thank you.

00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.002
Enjoy!

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.433
Good morning.

00:19:14.069 --> 00:19:16.405
Guys, the Clarion's out!

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.115
- Get your copy here.
- Clarion?

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:21.827
Yeah, our school paper. Do you want one?

00:19:21.994 --> 00:19:22.994
Sure!

00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:24.453
Thanks!

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.834
Guys, get your copies here!
The Clarion is out!

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:30.293
Come on.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.421
Come on, guys. Here.

00:19:33.589 --> 00:19:34.631
The Clarion is out.

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.732
Everyone seems so light and friendly.

00:19:55.027 --> 00:19:58.030
Now I miss my friends in St. Barth
even more.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:46.370
You're new here?

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:49.623
We're in the same course,
but we haven't met yet.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.459
I'm Rosetta. Rosetta Rodriguez.

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:54.628
Lorelei Rios.

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.090
You can call me Lori.
I just transferred this semester.

00:20:59.258 --> 00:21:01.134
I think we're gonna be friends.

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:03.345
I can sense some...

00:21:03.553 --> 00:21:05.138
I can sense some vibe.

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:07.266
You have a light aura.

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.644
I can also sense that...

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:12.562
your next class is Journ 103.

00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:14.939
You're good.

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.940
You're right.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:17.192
Are you going to class now?

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:20.027
Come on, let's go together.
We have the same classes.

00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:22.029
Our lockers are even next to each other.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.283
I feel like we're gonna be BFFs.

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:28.412
- Let's go? Come on, let's go.
- Sure.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:46.763
Hours turned into days.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:49.433
Days quietly became weeks.

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:54.146
I thought it would be hard for me
to adjust,

00:21:55.188 --> 00:21:58.775
but because of Rosetta
and my other blockmates,

00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:00.694
everything felt lighter.

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:20.422
Let's go.

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:27.178
- Bye, Lori. See you next week.
- See you around, Lori. Take care.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:27.888
Really?

00:22:27.889 --> 00:22:29.806
You're the only one they greeted?

00:22:30.098 --> 00:22:31.850
Beautiful. Such a long hair.

00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.685
Anyway, how are you? You're okay?

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:37.438
- The adjustments? New school? Is it okay?
- It's fine.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:39.231
- It's okay.
- It's okay? At least...

00:22:39.232 --> 00:22:42.443
Lori, let's eat at the kiosk. My treat.

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:44.905
Rosetta and I will
stop by the library first.

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:46.114
Next time, then?

00:22:47.324 --> 00:22:52.453
Hi, Lori. I got the STS readings
photocopied for you.

00:22:52.454 --> 00:22:55.831
- Excuse me. It's nice. Do I have one too?
- Thank you. You even bothered.

00:22:55.832 --> 00:22:57.458
Lori, anything you order, I got it.

00:22:57.459 --> 00:23:00.462
- It's okay. It's fine.
- What's your deal, man?

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:08.969
Clark University Repertory Club
Grand Auditions this Friday!

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:10.347
What's this, Rosetta?

00:23:15.018 --> 00:23:17.562
It’s Friday. It’s gonna be fun!

00:24:01.189 --> 00:24:04.484
See? I can do that too. Let's audition.

00:24:04.818 --> 00:24:06.778
I'm gonna pass on that.

00:24:07.028 --> 00:24:09.072
You're unbelievable.

00:24:09.281 --> 00:24:10.866
You're so pretty.

00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:13.076
No wonder so many boys like you.

00:24:13.326 --> 00:24:14.618
You're not gonna say yes?

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:15.828
- Even just one?
- Gosh.

00:24:15.829 --> 00:24:16.746
No.

00:24:16.747 --> 00:24:18.373
I'm focusing on the academics.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:20.625
And maybe next semester,

00:24:21.042 --> 00:24:22.919
I'll try joining The Clarion.

00:24:24.087 --> 00:24:26.465
Oh, so why not this semester?

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.801
Besides, it's Org Recruitment Week too.

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.763
I'll think about it, but,

00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:37.099
it seems too early
to get involved in an org.

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.602
I just transferred at Clark.

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:42.062
I'll just observe for now
how The Clarion works.

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:43.148
Fair point.

00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:47.360
But joining the dance group
sounds fun too. I want to dance.

00:24:53.867 --> 00:24:55.368
What happened to you?

00:24:56.578 --> 00:24:57.996
There's a scratch on this lock.

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:00.749
It wasn't there when I used it yesterday.

00:25:02.542 --> 00:25:04.126
Are you sure?

00:25:04.127 --> 00:25:06.379
Maybe you're the one who did that?

00:25:06.922 --> 00:25:07.922
No.

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:09.841
I'm careful with my keys.

00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.800
And...

00:25:12.886 --> 00:25:14.513
this is not just a simple scratch.

00:25:15.305 --> 00:25:16.848
Looks like it was forced.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.698
I knew it.

00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:36.451
Someone forced my locker open.

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:40.371
That's so sweet. I wish I had that too.

00:25:40.372 --> 00:25:41.581
What's so sweet?

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:43.250
Don't be surprised.

00:25:43.291 --> 00:25:47.087
You're gorgeous.
No doubt you'll have secret admirers.

00:25:47.128 --> 00:25:48.568
Right? You have a long hair like me.

00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:51.007
But someone still tampered with my locker.

00:25:51.967 --> 00:25:54.594
Rosetta, I'm freaked out.
He could steal from me.

00:25:55.762 --> 00:25:57.514
Is there a CCTV here?

00:25:58.306 --> 00:25:59.306
No.

00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:01.059
What's with you?

00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.268
Just chill.

00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:07.399
I'm sure he doesn't mean to rob you.
Look how sweet he is.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:09.401
It's yours.

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:10.777
Are you sure? 'Cause...

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:12.361
I'm on a diet.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.239
It's yours.

00:26:16.575 --> 00:26:19.035
We are all familiar
with the decimal system.

00:26:20.412 --> 00:26:25.750
But there are various number systems,
though we don't usually use them often.

00:26:26.376 --> 00:26:28.211
Can anyone give me examples?

00:26:29.045 --> 00:26:31.423
This is just a review, okay?

00:26:51.067 --> 00:26:52.319
I'm tired.

00:26:52.402 --> 00:26:53.570
Aren't you tired?

00:26:54.321 --> 00:26:57.032
I'm tired.
How come you still look so fresh?

00:26:57.616 --> 00:27:00.452
The world is so unfair. Why, universe?

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:14.883
Here he goes again.

00:27:15.383 --> 00:27:17.469
This was taken during our Math class.

00:27:18.428 --> 00:27:21.431
Rosetta, I have a stalker.
I need to report this.

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.933
And who exactly are you going to report?

00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:27.062
Who in our Math class did this?

00:27:27.270 --> 00:27:29.230
Who are the guys who like you?

00:27:29.564 --> 00:27:32.692
- Or girls, who knows?
- I need to find out who it is.

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:34.361
It's hard to point fingers.

00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:36.862
Why go through all this?

00:27:36.863 --> 00:27:38.906
He could've just talked to me in person.

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:42.243
Maybe he knew
you'd just reject him anyway.

00:27:42.827 --> 00:27:45.830
Actually, maybe you
already rejected him, so...

00:27:45.955 --> 00:27:46.706
there.

00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:47.832
So, what?

00:27:47.833 --> 00:27:49.376
Does that mean he get to stalk me?

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:52.462
And he can just force himself on me?

00:27:52.629 --> 00:27:54.089
That's not right either.

00:27:54.547 --> 00:27:57.676
If he really wants me,
he'll respect my choice.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.471
Hey, you know what.

00:28:02.472 --> 00:28:07.143
If you want to know who it is fast,
you could go to the...

00:28:07.352 --> 00:28:09.270
the detective club, the...

00:28:09.771 --> 00:28:10.771
Q.E.D. Club.

00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.440
- Detective club?
- That one.

00:28:13.233 --> 00:28:14.525
Like, when...

00:28:14.526 --> 00:28:17.236
say Clark U students have a problem,

00:28:17.237 --> 00:28:20.198
or if they’ve got mysteries
they want solved,

00:28:20.365 --> 00:28:21.783
that's where they go.

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:24.452
Like private investigators?

00:28:24.703 --> 00:28:26.663
Yeah, but they're students.

00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:31.334
It seems like it's gone now,
but maybe they're still active.

00:28:32.293 --> 00:28:33.544
You know what,

00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:37.716
if your secret admirer
hasn’t given up by tomorrow…

00:28:37.966 --> 00:28:39.843
go ahead and ask them for help.

00:28:40.218 --> 00:28:42.679
They're at Ibarra Hall,
on the third floor.

00:28:42.887 --> 00:28:44.681
At the row of the org rooms,

00:28:44.806 --> 00:28:46.975
they're at the far end.

00:28:47.183 --> 00:28:49.436
They have a sign on the door
that says Q.E.D. Club.

00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:52.188
Alright. I'll go ahead, okay?

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.441
See you. Bye.

00:29:05.285 --> 00:29:09.705
What the... Even my old photos?

00:29:09.706 --> 00:29:10.957
This has to stop.

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:55.752
Whatever this Q.E.D. Club is,

00:29:56.336 --> 00:29:58.505
I need to talk to them.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:02.091
To put an end to this mystery
once and for all.

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:39.879
Excuse me.

00:30:40.463 --> 00:30:42.465
Is this the Q.E.D. Club?

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.592
If you're familiar with
the English alphabet,

00:30:45.593 --> 00:30:47.136
and you know how to read,

00:30:47.512 --> 00:30:49.639
the answer to your question is obvious.

00:30:56.312 --> 00:30:57.312
Wait.

00:30:57.605 --> 00:30:58.773
Are you my roommate?

00:30:59.732 --> 00:31:00.942
What's your name again?

00:31:01.734 --> 00:31:02.734
Lorraine?

00:31:03.444 --> 00:31:04.444
Lorena?

00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:06.446
What?

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:08.240
I can't believe.

00:31:08.241 --> 00:31:10.868
After living in the same apartment
for the past few weeks,

00:31:10.869 --> 00:31:12.787
you still can't remember my name?

00:31:14.205 --> 00:31:16.331
You know what, never mind.

00:31:16.332 --> 00:31:18.626
Looks like I went into the wrong room.

00:31:19.711 --> 00:31:20.837
No need to lie.

00:31:23.089 --> 00:31:25.592
Just now you were asking
where the Q.E.D. Club is.

00:31:26.801 --> 00:31:28.219
And you're in the right room.

00:31:28.678 --> 00:31:31.054
And you're the last person
that I want to see today.

00:31:31.055 --> 00:31:34.058
So, if it's okay with you, I'll go ahead.

00:31:34.475 --> 00:31:35.475
Another lie.

00:31:36.853 --> 00:31:38.187
Excuse me?

00:31:40.690 --> 00:31:43.359
I'm not the last person you want to see.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.487
It's the person bothering you.

00:31:46.905 --> 00:31:48.656
A secret admirer perhaps.

00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:53.119
How did you know that?

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:54.913
Did someone tell you?

00:31:55.413 --> 00:31:56.456
Just a guess.

00:31:57.373 --> 00:31:58.373
And as usual...

00:31:59.709 --> 00:32:00.752
I'm right.

00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:07.342
Our first conversation must have left
a bitter taste in your mouth.

00:32:08.927 --> 00:32:10.386
But I believe I can help you.

00:32:12.138 --> 00:32:14.098
No pressure, of course.

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.226
You have two options.

00:32:19.103 --> 00:32:20.313
Option 1...

00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:24.651
You can leave now, like you said.

00:32:25.068 --> 00:32:27.528
And deal with your secret admirer.

00:32:29.405 --> 00:32:30.573
Or Option 2...

00:32:31.324 --> 00:32:33.618
You can tell me the details
of your problem.

00:32:33.826 --> 00:32:37.330
And I'll expose
the identity of this person.

00:32:39.499 --> 00:32:40.750
Don't worry,

00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:42.919
once your problem is solved,

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:45.421
we can go back to playing strangers again.

00:32:48.591 --> 00:32:49.591
Fine.

00:32:51.469 --> 00:32:52.720
Tell me what happened.

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:59.394
It started last Monday.

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:05.024
I noticed scratches on my locker lock.

00:33:05.191 --> 00:33:10.154
True enough, someone sent me a note,
chocolates, and flowers.

00:33:10.196 --> 00:33:15.535
I feel like it's one of my blockmates,
and he even found my old photos.

00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:17.370
And that was the latest gift.

00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:19.789
I came straight here right after I saw it.

00:33:21.833 --> 00:33:23.960
What time do you usually check
your locker?

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.964
Around 9 a.m.?

00:33:28.297 --> 00:33:29.549
9:30 a.m.?

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.885
And then in the afternoon, around 4 p.m.

00:33:33.136 --> 00:33:34.470
Sometimes, 3 p.m.

00:33:35.638 --> 00:33:37.473
Unless, there's P.E. class.

00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:40.767
Well...

00:33:41.602 --> 00:33:43.104
consider your problem solved.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.980
If you want,

00:33:45.148 --> 00:33:47.191
I can expose him this afternoon.

00:33:48.693 --> 00:33:49.902
Well, that was fast.

00:33:50.737 --> 00:33:52.113
Do you know who it is?

00:33:53.364 --> 00:33:54.364
Not yet.

00:33:56.117 --> 00:33:58.411
But I have an idea how I can find out.

00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:01.039
Until what time are your classes today?

00:34:02.206 --> 00:34:03.206
Until 4.

00:34:04.167 --> 00:34:05.167
Perfect.

00:34:05.668 --> 00:34:08.671
Meet me at exactly 5 p.m.
at the Main Building rooftop.

00:34:09.505 --> 00:34:12.467
This admirer of yours
will no longer be a secret.

00:34:13.593 --> 00:34:15.303
And your problem will be over.

00:34:18.556 --> 00:34:20.183
I hope you're right.

00:35:38.886 --> 00:35:39.886
Aaron?

00:35:40.763 --> 00:35:42.140
What are you doing here?

00:35:43.391 --> 00:35:44.976
You said you wanna see me.

00:35:47.019 --> 00:35:48.019
What?

00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:50.940
To be honest,

00:35:50.941 --> 00:35:52.775
my class actually ends at 5 p.m.

00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:55.403
But I came as fast I could.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:00.658
Sorry, but I didn't write that.

00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:02.994
You must be mistaken.

00:36:04.745 --> 00:36:06.539
I'm waiting for someone else here.

00:36:07.665 --> 00:36:09.792
But you left the message in your locker.

00:36:10.042 --> 00:36:12.211
You said you wanted to see me.

00:36:13.129 --> 00:36:14.755
Here, on the rooftop,

00:36:14.922 --> 00:36:15.923
at 5 p.m.

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:19.218
You wanted to get to know me?

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:22.054
So you could thank me

00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:23.555
for the gifts.

00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:25.265
Look.

00:36:28.644 --> 00:36:29.644
You?

00:36:30.271 --> 00:36:32.273
You're my secret admirer?

00:36:34.192 --> 00:36:35.859
Bye, Lori. See you next week.

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.819
See you around, Lori.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.820
Take care.

00:37:00.509 --> 00:37:01.636
Yours truly.

00:37:04.347 --> 00:37:05.348
What's wrong?

00:37:06.265 --> 00:37:08.017
You said you wanted to see me, huh?

00:37:09.435 --> 00:37:10.435
I'm here.

00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:14.189
Huh?

00:37:16.234 --> 00:37:17.234
No.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:19.237
I didn't write that note.

00:37:20.029 --> 00:37:21.029
Okay.

00:37:23.115 --> 00:37:24.115
Then who?

00:37:27.286 --> 00:37:28.287
Oh, you...

00:37:29.914 --> 00:37:31.707
You really like being funny, right?

00:37:32.541 --> 00:37:33.542
You know...

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.171
ever since your first day here,

00:37:37.672 --> 00:37:39.340
I really wanted to get to know you.

00:37:40.508 --> 00:37:41.801
Your smile is so cute.

00:37:42.635 --> 00:37:44.637
And I love when you laugh.

00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:46.722
Honestly,

00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:48.933
I thought you were avoiding guys.

00:37:50.017 --> 00:37:52.520
That's why I was so happy
when I found out...

00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:55.021
that...

00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.149
you like me back.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:59.277
That's not true.

00:37:59.777 --> 00:38:00.861
No, no, no.

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:03.698
It's okay. No need to be shy.

00:38:05.616 --> 00:38:06.659
It's just you,

00:38:07.159 --> 00:38:08.159
and me...

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:09.995
alone.

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:12.123
- Just like...
- Stay away from me.

00:38:14.083 --> 00:38:16.127
- Come here!
- No, no! No.

00:38:16.544 --> 00:38:18.169
- You wanted this, right?
- No, no.

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:20.046
- That's why you're here, right?
- No! No!

00:38:20.047 --> 00:38:21.047
Come here!

00:38:23.718 --> 00:38:25.011
Give it to me!

00:38:26.012 --> 00:38:27.388
Try screaming for help.

00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:28.555
Go!

00:38:35.688 --> 00:38:36.856
- No!
- Come here!

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.987
Loki, thank God you're here.

00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:37.166
As usual,

00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:38.876
my timing is perfect.

00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:48.677
But I had to make sure
that he was indeed your stalker.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:51.472
So, I waited for him
to force himself on you.

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:52.722
Huh?

00:39:53.307 --> 00:39:54.307
Don't worry.

00:39:54.558 --> 00:39:55.976
I have the evidence on video.

00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:58.938
- No! No!
- Come here!

00:39:59.814 --> 00:40:01.064
No! No!

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:03.233
- You wanted this, right?
- No! No!

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.234
What "no"?

00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:07.822
Wait, you've been here all this time?

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:11.283
Since 4:45.

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:12.910
I've been hiding there.

00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:16.329
When he finds out you're here alone...

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:17.790
he would lower his guard.

00:40:18.207 --> 00:40:20.251
And we will know his true intentions.

00:40:20.793 --> 00:40:21.793
And I'm right.

00:40:22.628 --> 00:40:24.380
He has bad intentions toward you.

00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:29.051
You've been here all this time,
but you let him touch me?

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:32.805
Don't worry about him.

00:40:33.722 --> 00:40:37.059
That's enough evidence
to expel that stalker.

00:40:37.726 --> 00:40:38.726
Besides,

00:40:38.978 --> 00:40:40.688
you won't get any love notes,

00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:42.648
chocolates, and...

00:40:50.239 --> 00:40:51.782
Is this how you say thank you?

00:40:52.825 --> 00:40:53.826
If yes,

00:40:54.743 --> 00:40:55.743
you're welcome.

00:40:56.036 --> 00:40:59.748
You have no idea how much you hurt me.

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:02.877
You lied to me

00:41:02.918 --> 00:41:05.671
and even used me as bait to catch him.

00:41:05.963 --> 00:41:07.715
You put me in danger!

00:41:08.048 --> 00:41:11.050
You just watched while he touched me!

00:41:11.051 --> 00:41:13.095
Which one of you is the worst?

00:41:15.723 --> 00:41:18.100
The end justifies the means.

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:20.895
You asshole!

00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.946
Aaron, I've been looking for you.

00:41:31.947 --> 00:41:33.281
Lisa, I can’t talk right now.

00:41:33.282 --> 00:41:34.824
Wait, I have something important to say.

00:41:34.825 --> 00:41:35.909
Lisa, I have to go!

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.953
- Are you okay? What happened?
- Never mind!

00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.164
Why are you so annoying?

00:42:25.042 --> 00:42:26.835
Did you miss us, Lorelei?

00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:31.549
You really think you can escape us?

00:42:32.466 --> 00:42:34.510
No matter where you go,

00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:36.845
we will follow you.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.640
Come on.

00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:42.059
Stop playing hard to get.

00:42:45.604 --> 00:42:47.481
Come with us.

00:42:48.941 --> 00:42:49.941
Come on.

00:43:33.819 --> 00:43:38.407
He is the most awful housemate!

00:43:39.074 --> 00:43:45.998
I thought moving here would help,
but it only got worse.

00:44:10.689 --> 00:44:11.940
I'd like to say sorry.

00:44:18.781 --> 00:44:20.407
What I did yesterday was wrong.

00:44:42.304 --> 00:44:45.265
I never thought I'd hear you say sorry.

00:44:47.976 --> 00:44:49.436
Do you accept my apology?

00:44:51.313 --> 00:44:53.399
Do you really think it's that easy?

00:44:53.649 --> 00:44:56.318
You think I'll forgive you
just because you said sorry?

00:44:58.112 --> 00:45:00.447
There’s nothing I can do
if you won't forgive me.

00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:06.120
I just felt compelled
that I need to say the magic word.

00:45:07.037 --> 00:45:08.247
Compelled?

00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:10.752
So you’re only doing it
because you feel forced?

00:45:12.584 --> 00:45:14.586
When you commit a mistake,

00:45:14.628 --> 00:45:16.296
yes, you should say sorry,

00:45:16.672 --> 00:45:18.549
but it should come from the heart.

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:20.843
Not because you're just being forced.

00:45:21.176 --> 00:45:22.176
Is that so?

00:45:22.970 --> 00:45:24.805
I thought it was done for reset.

00:45:25.472 --> 00:45:26.557
Reset?

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.640
Reset.

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:29.351
When you say sorry,

00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.104
the mistakes you committed gets reset.

00:45:32.813 --> 00:45:34.314
You can make mistakes again.

00:45:34.648 --> 00:45:37.234
And you can make mistakes
with that person too.

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:39.319
You already said sorry.

00:45:40.988 --> 00:45:42.906
Just like when someone says thank you.

00:45:43.907 --> 00:45:46.160
When they expresss
their gratitude to someone,

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.204
you can ask them to do a favor

00:45:49.413 --> 00:45:51.331
- for you in the future.
- Hold on.

00:45:51.707 --> 00:45:55.711
Which dictionary taught you
the meaning of "sorry" and "thank you"?

00:45:56.211 --> 00:45:57.421
My God.

00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:00.674
What kind of childhood did you have
that made you think like that?

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:02.925
Well,

00:46:03.302 --> 00:46:04.762
from my observation

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:07.639
that's just how people are.

00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:10.058
When you make mistake,

00:46:10.642 --> 00:46:11.685
say sorry.

00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:13.479
Then you'll make mistakes again.

00:46:13.854 --> 00:46:15.439
The cycle repeats.

00:46:16.732 --> 00:46:18.233
Even with your family?

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.068
Or friends? Really?

00:46:21.695 --> 00:46:22.946
I dont have friends.

00:46:25.657 --> 00:46:27.201
I don't need friends anyway.

00:46:28.535 --> 00:46:30.329
They're all just excess baggage.

00:46:33.165 --> 00:46:34.165
Fine.

00:46:34.833 --> 00:46:36.710
I'll accept your apology.

00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:38.337
But you owe me a favor.

00:46:41.590 --> 00:46:42.925
On the contrary...

00:46:44.676 --> 00:46:47.262
I solved your problem.

00:46:48.222 --> 00:46:51.141
So you owe me a favor.

00:46:53.185 --> 00:46:55.646
I want you to revise your blog post.

00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:57.731
It's written well,

00:46:58.357 --> 00:46:59.691
but I look like the bad one.

00:47:00.943 --> 00:47:02.736
You made me look like a villain.

00:47:04.446 --> 00:47:05.447
What?

00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:07.825
If it weren't for me,

00:47:07.950 --> 00:47:09.618
Arnold would still be bothering you.

00:47:09.743 --> 00:47:13.080
- Aaron! His name is Aaron!
- The point is...

00:47:14.122 --> 00:47:15.666
I did it for free.

00:47:16.625 --> 00:47:17.334
Now,

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:19.461
if you revise this blog post of yours,

00:47:20.128 --> 00:47:21.128
let's call it quits.

00:47:22.548 --> 00:47:24.591
You really are something, huh?

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:28.011
You're even going to meddle
with my personal blog post?

00:47:28.887 --> 00:47:30.764
Make your own blog if you want,

00:47:30.889 --> 00:47:32.641
but I'm not changing mine.

00:47:40.190 --> 00:47:42.817
This blog will be taking
an indefinite hiatus

00:47:42.818 --> 00:47:44.695
due to personal reasons.

00:47:44.778 --> 00:47:45.987
When the time is right,

00:47:45.988 --> 00:47:48.240
the letters to my Mom Ley
in my drafts folder

00:47:48.407 --> 00:47:50.367
can finally be published again.

00:48:01.879 --> 00:48:03.422
Don't come any closer!

00:48:03.505 --> 00:48:05.882
Lisa, please! Step back!

00:48:05.883 --> 00:48:10.136
I'm not coming down
until you take back Aaron's expulsion!

00:48:10.137 --> 00:48:13.473
If you don't take it back now,
I'll really jump!

00:48:14.892 --> 00:48:16.435
Don't come any closer!

00:48:38.832 --> 00:48:40.472
Oh, no, it looks like he's about to jump.

00:48:41.001 --> 00:48:44.922
They say Aaron committed a grave offense,
that's why he was expelled.

00:48:47.841 --> 00:48:49.134
This is my fault.

00:48:51.053 --> 00:48:52.304
This is my fault.

00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:06.567
It's you again.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:08.931
Are you gonna watch the shooting?

00:49:09.780 --> 00:49:10.781
Shooting?

00:49:11.114 --> 00:49:12.449
Everyone's freaking out.

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:14.075
What genre is this?

00:49:14.076 --> 00:49:14.952
Action?

00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:15.952
Drama?

00:49:16.161 --> 00:49:18.872
- Comedy?
- Loki, no. There's no shooting.

00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:22.792
Loki, I need your help.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.503
Please! We're running out of time.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.839
There's always time.

00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:29.382
And why my help?

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:32.844
Because we're the reason
Aaron got expelled.

00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:35.681
And that’s the reason Lisa will jump.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.433
Why the hell would she do that?

00:49:38.976 --> 00:49:40.601
I don't know. Okay?

00:49:40.602 --> 00:49:42.896
All I know is she wants
the expulsion reversed.

00:49:43.355 --> 00:49:44.648
Otherwise, she'll jump!

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:46.524
Look, Loki.

00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.567
I'm already forgetting
what Aaron did to me,

00:49:48.568 --> 00:49:50.612
because Lisa's life matters more.

00:49:50.946 --> 00:49:52.364
Don't you feel guilty?

00:49:53.615 --> 00:49:54.615
Why?

00:49:55.784 --> 00:49:57.911
I don't feel guilty
even when I step on a cockroach.

00:49:58.912 --> 00:50:01.247
This stalker of yours
has conciousness and free will

00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:03.542
yet he decided to force himself on you.

00:50:04.251 --> 00:50:05.491
I don’t feel guilty about that.

00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:07.086
Besides,

00:50:08.005 --> 00:50:09.923
what do I gain by stopping Lina?

00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:10.757
Lia?

00:50:10.924 --> 00:50:11.924
Lisa!

00:50:12.342 --> 00:50:13.468
What are you, Loki?

00:50:13.593 --> 00:50:14.803
What do you gain from this?

00:50:15.137 --> 00:50:16.388
You save a life!

00:50:16.596 --> 00:50:17.973
Isn't that enough?

00:50:18.598 --> 00:50:22.477
I swear, my conscience couldn't handle it
if anything bad happened to her.

00:50:24.646 --> 00:50:25.647
Not my cup of tea.

00:50:26.982 --> 00:50:27.982
But...

00:50:28.525 --> 00:50:30.152
if you wanna help her, go ahead.

00:50:33.363 --> 00:50:35.949
If you help, I'll be in your debt.

00:50:42.914 --> 00:50:44.291
So you owe me a favor?

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.501
Fine! Okay!

00:50:47.002 --> 00:50:48.587
I'll revise the blog post.

00:50:49.713 --> 00:50:50.713
No need.

00:50:51.465 --> 00:50:52.591
I have a better idea.

00:50:54.384 --> 00:50:56.261
Anything, I'll do it.

00:50:56.970 --> 00:50:59.389
As long as it's not against
my morals or principles.

00:50:59.598 --> 00:51:00.932
Just help.

00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.478
Good.

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.230
I'll be back in five minutes.

00:51:07.981 --> 00:51:10.317
I just need to get something
or I can't function.

00:51:10.525 --> 00:51:11.568
Five minutes?

00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:12.985
Loki!

00:51:18.533 --> 00:51:19.159
Miss!

00:51:19.367 --> 00:51:21.619
We can still talk this out!
Get away from there!

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:22.621
Talk about it?

00:51:22.954 --> 00:51:25.957
Talk about what? You're just fooling me.

00:51:36.593 --> 00:51:38.720
Lisa, don't do it. Please.

00:51:46.686 --> 00:51:47.686
Go ahead!

00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:50.272
Jump.

00:51:53.068 --> 00:51:54.319
What took you so long?

00:51:55.821 --> 00:51:57.447
I can't start without my coffee.

00:51:59.991 --> 00:52:03.411
This is all unnecessary morning drama.

00:52:03.703 --> 00:52:06.748
I told you not to come closer,
didn't I? I'll jump!

00:52:07.749 --> 00:52:09.042
Can't you hear me?

00:52:10.127 --> 00:52:11.253
I said, jump.

00:52:12.254 --> 00:52:13.672
No one's stopping you anymore.

00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:15.966
Loki, what are you doing?

00:52:17.676 --> 00:52:18.676
Come on,

00:52:19.094 --> 00:52:20.095
I have classes.

00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:21.763
We all have work.

00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:23.390
So, let's finish this.

00:52:24.057 --> 00:52:24.766
Why?

00:52:25.016 --> 00:52:26.434
You're not stopping me, huh?

00:52:26.935 --> 00:52:28.061
Why would I do that?

00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.312
If you want to jump off a building

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:32.273
because of some worthless guy,

00:52:32.274 --> 00:52:34.151
a stalker and abuser,

00:52:34.818 --> 00:52:35.818
be my guest.

00:52:36.361 --> 00:52:38.195
No need for this selfish behavior.

00:52:38.196 --> 00:52:39.196
Selfish?

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.241
And I'm the selfish one, huh?

00:52:41.575 --> 00:52:42.575
Yes.

00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:44.369
You only think about yourself.

00:52:45.287 --> 00:52:47.205
You don't care about your schoolmates,

00:52:47.664 --> 00:52:48.664
friends,

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:49.790
your family.

00:52:50.584 --> 00:52:53.211
You don't care
if you hurt them when you're gone.

00:52:54.087 --> 00:52:56.380
And you don't care if you let them down

00:52:56.381 --> 00:52:58.988
by wasting your life over what you want.

00:53:00.093 --> 00:53:01.678
If that's not selfishness,

00:53:02.679 --> 00:53:03.763
I don't know what is.

00:53:04.181 --> 00:53:05.515
I'm not selfish!

00:53:05.974 --> 00:53:07.893
What right do you have to judge me, huh?

00:53:08.143 --> 00:53:09.186
You don't know me.

00:53:09.436 --> 00:53:10.687
Take back what you said!

00:53:10.896 --> 00:53:14.107
Take back what you said!
Take back what you said!

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.569
Let me go! Let me go!

00:53:17.944 --> 00:53:19.446
Let me go!

00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.158
Let me go!

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.080
That was a close one.

00:53:29.539 --> 00:53:31.708
I really thought Lisa was going to jump.

00:53:32.667 --> 00:53:33.877
But, wait.

00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:37.297
Is that a technique you use
in these kinds of crises?

00:53:38.423 --> 00:53:40.299
Reverse psychology
with pattern interruptions

00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.385
usually works on these kinds of people.

00:53:42.761 --> 00:53:45.847
I wouldn't say it
if I wasn't confident it would work.

00:53:47.015 --> 00:53:48.015
Impressive.

00:53:50.727 --> 00:53:52.771
But now that I've kept
my end of the bargain,

00:53:53.688 --> 00:53:55.315
you owe me a favor.

00:53:55.815 --> 00:53:57.651
Favor? What favor?

00:53:59.444 --> 00:54:01.278
I expected you to deny

00:54:01.279 --> 00:54:02.781
or conveniently forget.

00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:04.699
So, I have this.

00:54:06.952 --> 00:54:08.870
Anything, I'll do it.

00:54:09.537 --> 00:54:11.790
As long as it's not against
my morals and principles.

00:54:12.123 --> 00:54:13.375
Just help.

00:54:16.211 --> 00:54:17.211
Fine!

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.420
Okay.

00:54:18.546 --> 00:54:20.173
What do you want me to do?

00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:27.305
I want you to join the Q.E.D. Club.

00:54:39.526 --> 00:54:42.736
The student council vice president
is bullying me.

00:54:42.737 --> 00:54:44.948
I don't know anything
about solving mysteries.

00:54:49.577 --> 00:54:53.539
I think I hear rustling
in the ceiling and walls.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.042
It's only been a few weeks
this semester, guys,

00:54:56.626 --> 00:54:58.086
but we already have a lot of issues.

00:55:01.756 --> 00:55:03.883
Why, Tita Martha?

00:55:05.593 --> 00:55:07.804
Lorelei, help me!

00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:12.308
Oh, my God.

00:55:20.608 --> 00:55:22.694
I did not expect you to figure it out.

00:55:23.945 --> 00:55:25.196
Just do it, Lori.

00:55:25.905 --> 00:55:32.287
The Q.E.D Club is the one and only
detective club in Clark University.

00:55:32.871 --> 00:55:35.707
Our mission is to
investigate hidden truths,

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:38.792
solve mysteries, logic and injustice.

00:55:38.793 --> 00:55:39.793
