00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.880
Seriously...

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.880
Is it that juicy?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.759
The gossip has hit our own college.

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:53.560
I didn't notice any signs before at all.

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.119
Fang'er.

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:59.320
Our Guifang is here.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.719
Quick, make way, make way.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:01.960
Hurry up, make way.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:03.159
Sit, sit, sit.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.640
What's up? What's up?

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:05.879
You don't know yet?

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:08.359
The whole school is talking about you and Wei Mingtian.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.959
I even saw the video on my feed.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:12.920
It looks pretty convincing.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.319
It can't be true, right, Guifang?

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:16.079
He's got good taste.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.400
Girls from our College of Agriculture...

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.680
...have both inner beauty...

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.680
...and good looks.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.920
Exactly.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.840
Wait a sec, wait a sec.

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:23.760
Where did this picture come from?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.480
Are you and Wei Mingtian really together?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.560
Dating a handsome guy...

00:01:30.879 --> 00:01:32.480
...is it different from us regular people?

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:33.879
What dating?

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.480
There's nothing going on between us.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.159
We're just classmates.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:38.719
I don't believe that.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:39.319
Really.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.359
Doesn't matter if it's real or not.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.879
Look, you both have the looks and the traffic.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.200
Why not start a live stream?

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.439
I could make a quick buck.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.400
Stop. You want to get yourself killed?

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.040
Wei Mingtian's fans...

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.680
...want to protect their most innocent...

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.040
...and kindest Brother Xiaotian.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.120
Your stream would get blown up in seconds.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.959
That makes sense.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.480
More news! More news!

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:02.959
The campus belle who rejected Wei Mingtian...

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.799
...is actually an ageless goddess.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.239
What is that?

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.599
Are they crazy?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.520
This person is really funny.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.960
Saying Fangfang is over forty.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.639
Who'd believe that? They're sick.

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:16.520
Spreading rumors.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.080
That's just ridiculous.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.919
Fangfang, they even photoshopped your ID.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.360
Really interesting. Funny.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.919
It looks real.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:25.520
Fang'er.

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.240
It must be fake.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:28.479
This... this...

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:30.960
F-Fake, right?

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.120
Yes, yes, yes, it's an impromptu stream.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.280
That's why we didn't post a teaser.

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.759
He's already on the way.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.919
He'll be there any minute.

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.479
I have class later, Brother Maizi.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.919
And I'm not in a relationship with Guifang.

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.360
You just put that...

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.759
Okay, okay, okay, I know, I know.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.599
Expiring food can be sold at a discount.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.840
But our Xiaotian isn't like that.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:59.759
Do I really need your traffic for the top spot?

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.879
Let's just leave it at that.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:01.520
Tonight...

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.759
I can have Xiaotian stream until dawn for you.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.479
What are you staring at? Get in the car.

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.960
I'm not in a relationship with Kong Guifang.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.599
You...

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.400
Do you really have to...

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.400
Fine.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Let's talk about this.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.400
The company...

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.319
created a cool, aloof persona for you.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.000
But look at you, you've become a simp.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.759
What is this? This is "Image shattered."

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.000
Boss Chen, who sells seal pills,

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:28.599
called me all afternoon.

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:29.960
Do you know how much I have to pay in damages?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.120
Sorry for the trouble, Brother Maizi.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.319
But that trending topic isn't...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.080
Let me tell you from experience.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.520
Removing a trending topic costs way more than getting on one.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.520
Do you know how much it costs?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.919
Do you know how much we have to spend now?

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.759
You, you, you... your rent,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.000
tuition fees,

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:51.159
renting clothes, renting cars.

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:52.879
My rent, buying clothes.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.439
Which of these doesn't cost money?

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:57.919
I know it's not easy for you, Brother Maizi.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.159
But that trending topic really is...

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.520
Fine.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.879
I'll take down the trending topic for you.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.479
But...

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.159
about this extra stream...

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.520
Darn it.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:12.719
Don't you have class?

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.039
I can ask for leave.

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.759
By the way,

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:21.120
what's that female classmate of yours called?

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.000
Guifang.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.759
Guifang.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.680
Let me see her photo.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.240
I think her image is pretty good.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.839
I think, how about...

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.519
you just bring her over.

00:04:29.519 --> 00:04:30.519
And then we can just...

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.199
just roll with the mistake and go with the flow, right?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.000
That works too.

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.519
How old is she again?

00:04:46.519 --> 00:04:47.120
Sorry.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.160
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:05.639
Why aren't you picking up?

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:06.600
Look at the trending topics, quick.

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:07.759
Auntie's secret is out.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.279
How is that possible?

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:17.759
That's so creepy.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.240
I don't believe it.

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.800
Could she be wearing a fake skin?

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.800
How on earth did she do it?

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:22.560
Must be plastic surgery.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.120
A Fu.

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.879
A Fu.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.720
A Fu.

00:05:44.399 --> 00:05:44.839
I'm calling

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.000
Brother Bee

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.879
Do you know A Fu?

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.399
Then please pass a message to him for me

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:58.399
I wasn't the one who leaked that stuff about my mom

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.199
Make sure he doesn't void the contract

00:06:00.399 --> 00:06:01.680
Also, ask him if he can come see me soon

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:03.920
Brother Bee

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:05.240
Did you hear me? I...

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.279
I'm training

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.199
Sister Rui wants you to check your phone

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.560
I saw it

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.800
Look at these psychos

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.519
Talking about Wei Mingtian's fans

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.160
Rumoring that Cousin is a 40-year-old auntie

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.240
Isn't that ridiculous? Seriously

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.000
You don't believe it?

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:19.079
Do you take me for a fool?

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.439
Who doesn't know how to photoshop an ID?

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.560
Pick up

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.720
Brother, that's not the most important thing

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.680
Let me ask you

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:25.120
Wei Mingtian

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.040
did he confess to Cousin?

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.240
Confessing is useless

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:31.319
Then I'm relieved

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.800
I knew Cousin wouldn't fall for him

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.319
That Wei Mingtian even told me

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:36.279
they were some kind of comrades

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.399
The one with the worst intentions

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.399
is a fake comrade like him

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.720
Luckily, Cousin has sharp eyes

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:43.399
and didn't let his scheme succeed

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.680
What if

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.959
Guifang is really old

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:52.480
and is my mom?

00:06:53.399 --> 00:06:55.680
The number you dialed is not answering

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:57.399
Brother

00:06:58.079 --> 00:07:00.120
there's a famous quote that puts it well

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.000
From now on, we address each other our own way

00:07:02.399 --> 00:07:03.120
I call you Brother

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.319
you call me Dad

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.000
B-B-B-Brother, I'm joking

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.240
But Brother, let me tell you

00:07:12.439 --> 00:07:13.639
for the sake of my sincerity

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.079
you have to side with me

00:07:15.079 --> 00:07:16.879
You can't side with Wei Mingtian, you know?

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.040
Alright, I'm going to get the meat

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.720
Get lost, get lost

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:20.519
Put it on your tab

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:22.720
Pick up the phone

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.800
Hello, Mom

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:25.199
Mom

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.480
Do you feel any discomfort right now?

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:29.279
Like your stomach or anything?

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:29.920
I'm fine

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.639
Then before that

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:33.519
Do you have those symptoms of the illness now?

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.519
But about my age being exposed

00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:37.000
What does that have to do with the illness?

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:43.160
You... don't be too anxious right now

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.720
The internet is just like that

00:07:44.959 --> 00:07:45.959
Without solid evidence

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:47.560
It's not like everyone will believe it

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:49.120
But anyway, for the next couple of days

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.360
You... just don't go out

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:51.079
Stay at home

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.279
Remember, you can't tell anyone

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.120
You can't tell anyone

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.839
Don't worry, Mom's lips are sealed

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.639
I didn't mention the medicine

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.399
Mom knows what to say and what not to say

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:03.800
Mom

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.120
You and that Wei Mingtian, you aren't...

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.480
You little brat

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:10.600
He's just a kid

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.120
Look at his age and look at mine

00:08:12.319 --> 00:08:13.040
You just analyze your mom all day, don't you?

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:13.519
Okay, okay, okay

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:14.519
Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye. See you, see you, see you

00:08:14.519 --> 00:08:15.439
I'm telling you, if you keep this up

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.079
Hello?

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:16.959
Hello?

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:20.560
Little brat

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.360
No wonder after she borrowed my tablet

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:25.680
She said I wasn't doing anything productive

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.480
I even laughed at her for being a mama's girl

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.320
She knew that to buy concert tickets

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.080
I drank tofu soup for half a month

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.000
I even taught her how to skip listening to long voice messages

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.519
And perfectly fool parents

00:08:40.279 --> 00:08:41.440
Her name is also

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:43.720
Very retro

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.679
So many clues

00:08:47.039 --> 00:08:48.240
Were we blind back then?

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:49.960
She uses face cream that costs five yuan a pack

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.039
And her skin is still that good

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:51.840
Impossible

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:52.840
Absolutely impossible

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.879
This must be some new medical beauty technology

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:57.120
Even rejuvenated female stars don't look this good

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.399
Our Guifang wouldn't spend that money

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.440
Could she have done something wicked?

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.159
She stays in the lab all day

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.759
Guifang's faith is science

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:06.279
Could she be raising a little fairy?

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:07.879
That casts spells on her every night?

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:10.120
Stop watching those fantasy dramas

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.720
The fairy she's raising is Xiao Yin, right?

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.240
Bringing her soy milk and buns every day

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.240
Guifang added her mom's WeChat

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.080
Her mom's WeChat

00:09:26.759 --> 00:09:27.519
Take care

00:09:43.279 --> 00:09:43.919
Xiao Yin

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:45.840
Xiao Yin, your keys

00:09:50.639 --> 00:09:52.799
How about... I take them to her?

00:11:26.679 --> 00:11:28.080
I also want to ask her myself

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.639
Exactly how old she is

00:11:43.279 --> 00:11:43.759
Professor Wang

00:11:44.159 --> 00:11:44.840
Wang... Professor Wang

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:47.000
That... that student Kong...

00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.919
Is that thing about student Kong Guifang true?

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:51.720
Sh-sh-she looks way too young

00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:52.840
What about it?

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.080
Let me find out for you

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.440
What magic pill did she take?

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.720
Teacher Gao

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.639
Guifang came to the university to learn

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.559
Nothing else is important

00:12:00.639 --> 00:12:01.480
That's true, that's true

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.080
So... so the school knows about it?

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.080
Of course

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.960
The school has already suggested that those

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.919
Students spreading Kong Guifang's personal info

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:10.919
Delete their posts and apologize

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:13.399
And as teachers

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:15.279
We need to ensure that students'

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:16.840
Studies and lives on campus are unaffected

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:17.879
Anything else has nothing to do with you

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.480
Or with me

00:12:21.159 --> 00:12:22.240
R-right, right

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.279
How come I'm the only one who didn't know?

00:12:26.279 --> 00:12:27.519
Are you guys isolating me?

00:12:47.799 --> 00:12:49.200
The BOT fans are delusional.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:51.399
Saying she's old? Who'd believe that?

00:12:51.919 --> 00:12:52.679
I believe it.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.279
Maybe she just has great genes.

00:12:54.279 --> 00:12:55.360
And really is over forty.

00:12:55.919 --> 00:12:56.840
Our Duxing University BOT

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.080
isn't a fake news BOT.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.480
Why spread rumors like this for no reason?

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.480
If she's forty and looks like this,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.480
she must have had plastic surgery.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:04.320
No way.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.759
She'd have to get her whole body done.

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:06.879
Quiet down, everyone.

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:10.480
Welcome to the Happiness Class.

00:13:11.039 --> 00:13:12.159
I am your instructor.

00:13:12.159 --> 00:13:12.720
My surname is Gao.

00:13:13.799 --> 00:13:15.039
This class is all about happiness.

00:13:16.159 --> 00:13:17.000
Some people think

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.679
"The wide sea allows fish to leap,"

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.600
"the high sky lets birds fly" is happiness.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.879
Some think "The moon over the willows,"

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:26.519
"a meeting after dusk" is also happiness.

00:13:27.519 --> 00:13:28.000
Of course,

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.879
happiness is not a formula.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.440
So, how do we find happiness?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.279
How do we find our own happiness?

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:35.679
Over the next eight weeks,

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.279
we will slowly reveal the answer.

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.240
First, let's take a look at

00:13:39.559 --> 00:13:40.639
the books I recommend for you.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.840
You probably think the teacher played the wrong thing, right?

00:13:58.759 --> 00:14:00.480
Yes, they just made a mistake.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.480
Anyway...

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.759
Let's continue with the class. Come on.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.039
For those who missed out before...

00:14:11.039 --> 00:14:12.120
For those who missed out...

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.080
You really have to be quick on the draw today.

00:14:14.639 --> 00:14:15.600
These items today...

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.000
Are all products near their expiration date.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.600
But there is no problem with the quality.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.320
They are all within the shelf life.

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.000
So, our first bundle...

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:22.960
Our first special deal is...

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:25.639
A bundle for twenty-eight eighty-eight.

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.519
What does it include?

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:28.360
It's packed with goodies.

00:14:28.519 --> 00:14:30.480
There's a row of Osmanthus yogurt.

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:32.159
And a box of Osmanthus square cakes.

00:14:32.399 --> 00:14:33.279
That's not all.

00:14:33.399 --> 00:14:36.360
We'll add a bottle of this Osmanthus honey.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.480
It's worth mentioning that...

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.879
This Osmanthus honey...

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.600
It has been aged over time.

00:14:40.759 --> 00:14:42.480
The fragrance of the Osmanthus...

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:43.840
Is even more intense.

00:14:44.399 --> 00:14:45.480
So, everyone take a guess.

00:14:45.639 --> 00:14:47.440
Among all these foods...

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:48.080
Our Xiaotian...

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.000
Which one does he like the most?

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.919
You can type the answer...

00:14:51.919 --> 00:14:52.960
In the chat.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.600
Let's see if you guess right.

00:14:55.559 --> 00:14:56.159
Gui.

00:14:58.519 --> 00:14:59.200
Yes, yes, yes.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:00.759
The fam really knows what's up.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.039
So is it...

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:02.960
Link number two.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.840
Link number two is already sold out.

00:15:05.279 --> 00:15:06.799
Your speed is absolutely top-notch.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:07.960
How about this?

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.320
Let's give everyone a bonus, okay?

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.519
Let's have our Xiaotian...

00:15:10.679 --> 00:15:12.960
Perform for everyone...

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.799
Chugging a bottle of yogurt in one go, okay?

00:15:17.039 --> 00:15:18.960
Type "1" in the chat if you want to see it.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.480
Let me see if anyone wants to watch.

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.679
Xiaotian can't wait.

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:23.720
It seems this yogurt...

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:26.120
Really has won Xiaotian's heart.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:29.000
So if the fam also likes to drink it...

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.519
Don't miss out on our link number two.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.639
Xiaotian downed it in one gulp!

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:36.200
Okay, let's interview Xiaotian.

00:15:36.679 --> 00:15:38.600
How is this Osmanthus yogurt, really?

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.120
Can you tell us? Is it good?

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.360
This Guifang yogurt...

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:45.080
Guifang...

00:15:45.279 --> 00:15:47.159
Right, Gui... Osmanthus yogurt is delicious.

00:15:47.159 --> 00:15:47.679
Right?

00:15:48.039 --> 00:15:48.519
Come, come, come.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:49.399
Our Xiaotian...

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:50.559
Must have had too much.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:51.960
He's drunk... drunk on milk. Come on.

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:53.039
Xiaotian, wipe your mouth.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:53.639
He's tired too.

00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.120
Go down and rest a bit, Xiaotian.

00:15:55.399 --> 00:15:56.200
Go rest for a moment.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.120
Our Xiaotian works pretty hard.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.600
Let's let Xiaotian rest for a while.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.919
Hurry up and sell all that backlog stock.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.399
No, we're out of food.

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:06.200
You're not running a food company.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.120
Don't you sell everything?

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:07.840
Anything with "Gui"...

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.000
Bedside cabinets, bookshelves, wardrobes...

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.840
Anything with "Fang"... sugar cubes, instant noodles...

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:12.679
Sell whatever you can.

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:13.799
Put up the links.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:15.399
I can't stand the way you do business.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:18.320
Don't worry about what kind of buzz it is.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.039
As long as it's hot, it's buzz, right?

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.399
It doesn't matter if it's a black cat or a white cat.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:22.559
If it catches mice, it's a good cat.

00:16:23.799 --> 00:16:24.240
Wait a minute.

00:16:30.799 --> 00:16:31.240
What are you doing?

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.200
Hurry up.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.559
We're talking hundreds of thousands a minute here.

00:16:35.559 --> 00:16:36.399
And you have time to rest?

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:37.320
Hey!

00:16:37.919 --> 00:16:38.879
Hey, where was I?

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:40.480
Black cat, white cat.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:42.960
Make way, make way.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:43.600
Make way.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:54.159
Uh, Fang'er...

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.000
You...

00:16:56.919 --> 00:16:59.440
Are you coming back to the dorm with us?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.400
I'm going home tonight.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:08.279
Alright then, we'll head out first.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.279
Auntie, move aside.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:13.079
Auntie, move aside. Auntie.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.119
What's wrong with "Auntie"?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.799
"Auntie" isn't a shameful title.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:18.240
Everyone gets old eventually.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:20.480
Look at this.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.200
Wearing a floral dress at her age?

00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:23.640
Yeah.

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:24.640
It looks so out of place.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.559
She probably doesn't realize it herself.

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.119
The older they get, the more they try to act young.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:29.440
At her age...

00:17:29.839 --> 00:17:30.960
At her age...

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.039
In another two years, she could be called "Grandma."

00:17:33.039 --> 00:17:33.440
You can say that again.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.920
Jealous?

00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:35.400
People in their twenties...

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.039
No one looks that young at that age.

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:38.759
Pathetic. Brainless.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.160
Hurting someone you don't even know.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.640
You're just like those...

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.599
...mean, stereotypical villains on TV.

00:17:44.759 --> 00:17:45.319
Who are you talking about?

00:17:45.319 --> 00:17:45.799
Who are you talking about?

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.279
Who is that?

00:17:46.839 --> 00:17:47.839
I'm talking about people in their twenties.

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:48.319
You guys...

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.440
...don't look it.

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:52.039
You're really something.

00:17:52.039 --> 00:17:52.960
You're just too much.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.240
You are seriously too much.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:13.759
Is the info reliable?

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.000
According to reliable sources...

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.880
...the info is absolutely reliable.

00:18:23.599 --> 00:18:24.039
Let's get to work.

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:25.240
Phone number? Check.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.480
HD photos? Got 'em.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.960
Verification code bomber? Ready.

00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:29.440
Five hundred real-person trolls? Ready.

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:31.240
We have to let Brother Xiaotian know the truth.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:43.920
Brother Xiaotian, your heart was wasted on her.

00:18:44.119 --> 00:18:46.279
Kong Guifang is just an old hag.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.799
She's in her forties or fifties.

00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:49.799
Don't let her deceive you.

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:50.839
Don't worry.

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:52.880
We'll expose her true colors.

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.359
You're back.

00:19:40.279 --> 00:19:40.680
Senior.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.480
Morning, Senior.

00:19:48.519 --> 00:19:49.720
I saw that person in the cafeteria...

00:19:50.319 --> 00:19:51.359
...what's-her-name's boyfriend.

00:19:51.519 --> 00:19:51.839
This...

00:19:56.319 --> 00:19:57.400
Is that really true?

00:19:58.079 --> 00:20:00.039
Are they really mother and son?

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:00.839
Nineteen seventy-seven.

00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:02.480
Why do they look like a young couple?

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:03.759
You don't get it.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.559
Isn't this "stepmom romance"?

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:07.200
It's very trendy.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.240
I was saying, when she was in the Student Union...

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.039
...she felt a bit weird.

00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.200
Turns out she has a heavy "mom vibe."

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.079
Coming through, coming through.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.039
Sorry, coming through.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:42.960
Xiao Yin

00:20:43.559 --> 00:20:44.079
What are you doing?

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:45.440
Playing "The Thinker" here?

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:47.240
Let me tell you

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.480
Today is my lucky day

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.839
Second breakfast is half price

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.920
Come on, let's eat together

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.480
What's wrong?

00:20:57.279 --> 00:20:58.680
You're pouting enough to hang a fried dough stick on your lip

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.039
What else could it be?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.119
It's just that thing

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.400
I really didn't expect she could lie to me for so long

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:07.960
That...

00:21:08.799 --> 00:21:09.400
Which one?

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.160
Him?

00:21:12.559 --> 00:21:13.440
The kid is heartbroken

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:17.720
Right

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:19.599
No matter what

00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:21.079
Lying is wrong

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000
But you can't say it like that

00:21:25.039 --> 00:21:26.119
If I were in her situation

00:21:26.119 --> 00:21:27.279
I wouldn't be able to say it either

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.519
But I'm the person closest to her

00:21:30.799 --> 00:21:32.119
How could she not even tell me?

00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.440
Even if she didn't tell others, she should've told me

00:21:36.359 --> 00:21:37.559
Looks like you still have feelings

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:39.720
This...

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:41.079
How should I put this?

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:43.559
Some things...

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.559
Are actually harder to tell those closest to you

00:21:45.559 --> 00:21:46.359
The closer they are, the harder it is to say

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:47.519
Why is that?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:49.640
Because a hundred words from outsiders

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.640
Can't match one word of misunderstanding from a loved one

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:54.759
Of course

00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:56.640
These are your personal choices

00:21:57.519 --> 00:21:58.519
If you're really that angry

00:21:58.960 --> 00:21:59.759
Just ignore him

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.680
From now on, you go your separate ways

00:22:02.759 --> 00:22:03.559
How can I do that?

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:05.240
How can a person be so cold-blooded?

00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:07.319
She's being scolded so badly right now

00:22:07.839 --> 00:22:09.480
If I draw a line with her at this time

00:22:09.559 --> 00:22:10.240
What would I become?

00:22:10.559 --> 00:22:11.559
Am I that kind of person?

00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:13.720
Look

00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:15.039
Actually

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.839
You already have the answer in your heart

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:19.119
You're just resentful

00:22:19.599 --> 00:22:20.240
If you ask me

00:22:20.519 --> 00:22:21.720
You're just draining yourself

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:22.480
Wasting time

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:25.039
You have to learn to face the facts

00:22:26.079 --> 00:22:27.759
Actually, there are only two choices

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.319
Accept or reject

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:31.920
Since you don't want to cut ties with him

00:22:32.319 --> 00:22:34.279
Then the only option left is to accept it

00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:34.960
Right?

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:40.839
You're right

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:43.279
Actually, I'm just a bit conflicted

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.279
She didn't trust me

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:46.079
She didn't tell me this immediately

00:22:46.559 --> 00:22:47.000
Yes

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.880
It was me being too petty

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:50.680
No, no, no

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.799
You even liked her

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.119
And you're still this open-minded

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:57.519
I really admire you a bit

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:02.559
That...

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:04.279
Wait a minute, that...

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.039
You mean this "him"... I...

00:23:09.359 --> 00:23:10.640
Don't you like Fang'er?

00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:15.039
You're saying this "she" is the cousin?

00:23:15.519 --> 00:23:16.960
Yeah, Guifang

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:18.519
Then what you just said...

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.240
You mean the cousin lied to you?

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.319
Otherwise what?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:23.359
No...

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.119
Why do you still call her cousin?

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.279
No...

00:23:26.279 --> 00:23:27.680
Then... then what the reports said...

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.759
Aren't those all rumors?

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.279
No, bro, are you on 2G?

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:35.599
Guifang has already admitted it

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.279
She is forty-six years old

00:23:39.559 --> 00:23:40.079
Wait a minute

00:23:43.039 --> 00:23:43.599
Say that again

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.720
No, bro, are you on 2G?

00:23:47.359 --> 00:23:48.200
Guifang has already admitted it

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.839
Alright, stop talking

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.920
Alright, look for yourself

00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:01.880
I, Kong Guifang,

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:03.720
was born in 1977.

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:05.200
I am forty-six years old this year.

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:23.559
No

00:24:25.599 --> 00:24:28.119
Cousin

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:10.319
What are you two doing?

00:25:11.039 --> 00:25:11.960
Stop messing around.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.000
Come with me, quick. Something happened.

00:25:19.599 --> 00:25:20.519
You too, come with me quickly.

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:23.920
Hurry.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.039
I brought them all.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.079
Okay.

00:25:31.039 --> 00:25:31.640
Everyone's here.

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.079
Alright, Intelligence Team.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.480
Right now, most students...

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.440
...still don't really believe it.

00:25:36.759 --> 00:25:37.559
Their focus is all on...

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.240
...how Guifang maintains her looks.

00:25:39.559 --> 00:25:40.160
To be honest...

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.519
...I really want to know too.

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:44.440
But there's a small group...

00:25:44.599 --> 00:25:46.200
...using this as an outlet to vent.

00:25:46.519 --> 00:25:48.160
Someone even started a thread on our school forum...

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.200
...specifically dedicated...

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.039
...to spreading rumors about you and your mom.

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:52.799
The insults are pretty nasty.

00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:56.400
These...

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.559
...are all ones I tore off the bulletin board.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.079
They might be posted elsewhere too.

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:02.079
This means the person who wants to hurt Auntie...

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.519
...is right here close to us.

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.880
So we must unite now...

00:26:06.039 --> 00:26:07.039
...and form an Avengers alliance.

00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:07.799
To protect Guifang.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.319
Right.

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:10.000
Wait a minute.

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:11.240
Wait a minute.

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:13.920
What are you guys talking about?

00:26:15.559 --> 00:26:16.599
Who is whose mom?

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:17.880
You didn't tell him?

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:19.400
I didn't have time.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.160
See for yourself.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:21.599
Look.

00:26:46.559 --> 00:26:47.079
Godmother.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:05.599
What Godmother?

00:27:08.839 --> 00:27:09.279
Hello.

00:27:10.519 --> 00:27:11.119
I'm Li Wai.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.000
We're a perfect match.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.079
Let's check our astrological compatibility later.

00:27:13.079 --> 00:27:14.960
How about I call you Fangfang?

00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.680
As long as I'm here...

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:18.160
...I won't let anything trouble you.

00:27:18.359 --> 00:27:19.680
My admiration for you...

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.359
...is beyond words.

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:22.720
I'm going to confess to her.

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:23.920
Brother-in-law.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:56.319
Godmother.

00:28:32.039 --> 00:28:32.960
Can't count on him anymore.

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.480
I'll go ask the school if we can check the surveillance.

00:28:35.759 --> 00:28:36.880
See who actually posted these.

00:28:37.079 --> 00:28:38.039
I'll go check other places too...

00:28:38.039 --> 00:28:39.039
...to see if there are more posters.

00:28:39.359 --> 00:28:40.680
This person is really foul-mouthed.

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:42.000
Watch me flame him to death.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:42.920
I'll flame him.

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:43.359
Forget it.

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:44.400
On the internet...

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.400
...arguing with anonymous people is pointless.

00:28:47.039 --> 00:28:49.200
The most important thing now is to protect my mom.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.240
Let's go.

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:51.440
You're right.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.119
I almost acted rashly there.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.079
Let's go.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.519
We should act our age.

00:29:25.319 --> 00:29:27.200
Why do you keep trying to fit in with young people?

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:29.720
You went to the amusement park...

00:29:30.839 --> 00:29:32.279
...and mingled with the kids.

00:29:33.359 --> 00:29:34.640
You even got a confession from Wei Mingtian.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.799
Do you really think you're young now?

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:39.400
Do you even know who you are anymore?

00:30:00.279 --> 00:30:00.680
A Fu

00:30:01.359 --> 00:30:01.759
A Fu

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:02.640
A...

00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:06.400
You wander around all day when nothing's up

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.359
But disappear when I actually need you

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:15.319
Brother Cow, Brother Cow

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.759
Do you know A Fu?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.279
If you know him, tell him to find me

00:30:18.359 --> 00:30:18.839
Do you know him?

00:30:19.599 --> 00:30:21.160
A Fu, A Fu, A Fu

00:30:24.279 --> 00:30:24.720
Thanks

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:29.880
Brother Sheep

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:31.680
Brother Sheep, Brother Sheep

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:33.440
Do you know A Fu?

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:35.039
If you know him

00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:36.240
Tell him to hurry up and find me, okay?

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:36.960
Tell him to show up

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:37.680
Brother Sheep

00:30:38.759 --> 00:30:39.079
Brother Sheep

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:40.960
Thanks, thanks

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:47.440
Brother Goose

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.319
Brother Goose

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:49.440
Do you know A Fu?

00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:49.920
A Fu

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.359
Where is he? Over there?

00:30:51.559 --> 00:30:52.160
Brother Goose, Brother Goose

00:30:52.519 --> 00:30:53.519
Brother Goose, where is A Fu?

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.799
Are you two messing with me?

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.039
If you know, say something

00:30:56.039 --> 00:30:56.799
If you don't, say something too

00:30:56.799 --> 00:30:57.400
Do you know him or not?

00:30:58.519 --> 00:30:58.920
Big Brother

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:20.519
Goodbye

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.559
My ninth first love

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:31.359
Goodbye

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.599
Cousin

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:36.599
No

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.160
Godmother

00:31:42.759 --> 00:31:43.319
Godmother

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:49.599
Should I let Xiaocan know?

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:52.640
Is that her and her son?

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.720
Looks pretty immoral

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:55.839
Seriously

00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:57.319
I certainly wouldn't

00:31:58.359 --> 00:31:59.640
That is just too much

00:31:59.799 --> 00:32:02.359
Always rushing around, who knows what she's up to

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.079
It was you guys, wasn't it?

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.039
Auntie

00:32:09.799 --> 00:32:10.759
What did you say?

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:11.559
Yeah, what are you talking about?

00:32:11.559 --> 00:32:12.279
Yeah, Auntie

00:32:12.359 --> 00:32:13.519
I'm talking about spreading rumors

00:32:13.799 --> 00:32:15.559
You're the ones sending me harassing messages, right?

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:18.160
You chase stars until you can't tell right from wrong

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.640
Are you doing right by your idol?

00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:21.519
You have the nerve to mention our Xiaotian?

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:23.160
Why don't you take a look at yourself?

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.519
What kind of old hag you are

00:32:25.519 --> 00:32:26.839
Isn't that the truth?

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.680
Why did you hide your age?

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.759
Don't you know yourself?

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.720
And besides

00:32:31.079 --> 00:32:33.279
If you dare to do it, don't be afraid of people talking

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:35.279
Yeah, stop playing dumb

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.200
I, Kong Guifang

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.839
Was born in 1977

00:33:02.319 --> 00:33:03.279
I am 46 years old this year

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:08.160
This year's Tier 1 cutoff for science students

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:10.119
Was 512 points

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:12.640
I scored 563 points

00:33:13.079 --> 00:33:15.599
And am a formally admitted student of Duxing University

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.960
Since I was seven years old

00:33:21.519 --> 00:33:23.039
My life's wish has been to go to college

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.599
But when I was 18

00:33:26.279 --> 00:33:27.519
Something happened in my family

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:28.960
And I had to drop out

00:33:31.359 --> 00:33:33.000
Over 20 years passed in a flash

00:33:35.319 --> 00:33:37.039
I still feel that not going to college

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:40.319
Is the biggest regret of my life

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.759
So I went to a prep school

00:33:43.759 --> 00:33:45.119
And studied my heart out for a year

00:33:46.599 --> 00:33:47.680
Just like all of you

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.720
I took the college entrance exam

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.559
And am standing in a university classroom now

00:33:53.559 --> 00:33:55.680
Yes, I look young

00:33:56.599 --> 00:33:57.319
I don't look my age

00:33:59.079 --> 00:34:00.359
But if I told everyone I met

00:34:01.279 --> 00:34:02.759
That I'm 46 years old

00:34:03.359 --> 00:34:04.480
You wouldn't be able to tell, right?

00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:06.680
Wouldn't you think

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:09.280
I came to the school to sell cosmetics?

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.559
Then would you still be able to

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:14.559
Be as close to me as before?

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.400
College life, for me,

00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:29.239
is truly precious.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:31.920
I've longed for it for over thirty years.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.639
I just wanted to experience college life properly.

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.440
I didn't want so many people focusing on

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.639
why I look so young.

00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:45.320
After all, how many people in this world

00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.159
can fulfill a regret from their twenties

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.880
when they are nearly fifty?

00:35:01.159 --> 00:35:02.360
If my hiding the truth

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:04.440
has hurt everyone,

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:08.360
then right here,

00:35:10.159 --> 00:35:11.840
I want to sincerely say to everyone:

00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:15.679
I'm sorry.

00:35:28.159 --> 00:35:30.440
Actually, my mom has always wanted to go to college.

00:35:31.119 --> 00:35:32.920
For so many years, I've known

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:33.960
she wasn't content.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.280
Aren't we being a bit too harsh?

00:35:35.519 --> 00:35:36.719
She just wanted to go to college.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.760
What's wrong with that?

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:47.840
Kong Guifang, I support you.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.840
What is going on here?

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:53.480
Even if you love studying,

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.519
going to the same university as your own son,

00:35:56.519 --> 00:35:58.920
isn't that disgusting, Auntie?

00:35:59.239 --> 00:36:00.440
Exactly.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.840
Me going to the same university as my son,

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.559
how is that disgusting?

00:36:05.159 --> 00:36:05.840
How is it not disgusting?

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.440
Aren't you the ones being disgusting?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.400
Aren't you the ones saying disgusting things?

00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:10.760
Let me tell you,

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.800
delete that stuff online for me.

00:36:13.159 --> 00:36:14.280
Or else I won't be polite.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:14.920
Alright then.

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:16.519
I'd like to see

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.199
how you won't be polite to me.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:19.679
I...

00:36:20.199 --> 00:36:21.559
Mom, Mom, Mom.

00:36:21.559 --> 00:36:22.039
Stop fighting.

00:36:22.239 --> 00:36:22.639
Let go.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:24.000
How does this kid talk like that?

00:36:24.199 --> 00:36:25.960
Where is your conscience? Where did it go?

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:28.320
Kong Xiaocan.

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:30.480
What is wrong with you?

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:32.840
Be reasonable.

00:36:33.079 --> 00:36:34.760
Do you have a conscience? Do you?

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:35.760
How can you talk like that?

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.400
Okay, okay.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.039
Let go.

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:39.599
Did you hear what she just said?

00:36:40.159 --> 00:36:41.199
She was so out of line.

00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.280
Kong Xiaocan, why are you stopping me?

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:42.800
Enough, enough, enough.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.920
I'm telling you, did you hear what she just said?

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.039
Look how old you are.

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:46.760
Why are you arguing with a kid?

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.039
Look how old I am?

00:36:48.119 --> 00:36:48.679
Whose side are you on?

00:36:48.679 --> 00:36:50.039
Don't give me that "whatever" attitude.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:50.840
Enough, listen to me.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.719
Can you be reasonable, Mom?

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:52.960
Who's reasoning with you?

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.559
You don't understand the internet.

00:36:55.639 --> 00:36:57.039
The internet's memory only lasts three days.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.440
In three days, everyone will focus on something else.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.239
And forget about this.

00:36:59.239 --> 00:36:59.840
Just endure it.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.840
Can't you wait three days?

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.119
If you argue and make a scene like this,

00:37:02.519 --> 00:37:03.480
more and more people will pay attention.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:04.840
Won't that affect your life?

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:06.320
Don't be in such a rush to give your opinion.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.480
I have more say in this matter than you.

00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:08.840
I've been online more than you've eaten meals.

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:11.079
Mom.

00:37:12.159 --> 00:37:13.480
You've worked hard for most of your life.

00:37:14.039 --> 00:37:15.840
You finally get to live the life you want.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:17.719
Can't we just live comfortably?

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:18.840
Don't bother with them.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.400
Your son isn't afraid of trouble.

00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:22.679
But I don't want

00:37:22.679 --> 00:37:24.000
others to affect your current life.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.039
You don't have a dad.

00:37:25.039 --> 00:37:26.360
Why do you sound so much like a dad?

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.440
I'm really doing this for your own good.

00:37:28.559 --> 00:37:29.280
Now it smells even stronger.

00:37:34.519 --> 00:37:35.719
Is that what you all think?

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.960
Guifang, this thing is never-ending.

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:39.800
People who believe in you,

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.320
even if you don't say anything, we know clearly.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.400
Those mobs, no matter how much you explain,

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.199
they will only believe what they want to believe.

00:37:45.199 --> 00:37:46.639
Who said I'm going to use my mouth?

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:47.320
Then what?

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:48.840
You going to crawl through the internet cable and pull their hair?

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.639
Slap them in the face?

00:37:49.639 --> 00:37:50.519
Why can't I?

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.440
Just because we can't see them,

00:37:52.559 --> 00:37:53.920
does that mean they can say whatever they want

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:54.840
on the internet?

00:37:55.239 --> 00:37:56.480
You can't do that in reality,

00:37:56.559 --> 00:37:58.039
so why is it okay online?

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:00.079
The internet is not a lawless place.

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.280
If they dare to say that,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.880
they have to be responsible for their words.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:03.599
Do you understand?

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:05.039
Right.

00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:08.400
Godmother, Godmother.

00:38:09.079 --> 00:38:10.039
I support you.

00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:14.599
The law is indeed the most effective method.

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:15.920
But it will be very hard.

00:38:16.519 --> 00:38:17.400
Have you thought it through?

00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:20.159
I've made up my mind.

00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:22.079
Okay.

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:24.519
Since you've made up your mind,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.679
then let's just do it.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:27.239
Let's go all out.

00:38:35.199 --> 00:38:36.119
Kong Xiaocan, are you still going to endure this?

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.519
If that's the case...

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.360
Endure my ass.

00:38:44.360 --> 00:38:44.960
Don't swear.

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:47.840
Screw it.

00:38:53.199 --> 00:38:53.800
Feel free to look around.

00:38:55.719 --> 00:38:56.639
Everything is fresh.

00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:01.760
Their family's Old Kong...

00:39:02.719 --> 00:39:04.559
Hasn't he been paralyzed for years?

00:39:04.559 --> 00:39:06.400
He was fine for so long while paralyzed.

00:39:06.559 --> 00:39:08.400
But died just when the girl got pregnant.

00:39:08.719 --> 00:39:10.000
If that's not a curse, what is?

00:39:11.079 --> 00:39:13.039
The child in her belly is also a jerk.

00:39:13.159 --> 00:39:15.039
Heard she tried for years without success.

00:39:15.039 --> 00:39:17.079
But got pregnant the day Old Kong died.

00:39:17.679 --> 00:39:19.079
Exactly. So shameless.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.840
Tolerance only encourages them to go further.

00:39:27.639 --> 00:39:28.559
We have to draw our swords.

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.000
Let them know we're not pushovers.

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:32.159
Shut up, all of you!

00:39:33.199 --> 00:39:34.920
Do you all have nothing better to do?

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:35.840
Badmouthing me right here.

00:39:36.199 --> 00:39:37.000
Let me tell you something.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.320
I, Kong Guifang, haven't wronged anyone.

00:39:41.239 --> 00:39:42.719
Neither has the child in my belly.

00:39:44.679 --> 00:39:45.599
Our child...

00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:47.800
The due date is in June.

00:39:48.719 --> 00:39:50.480
You'd better all come to the full moon party then.

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.000
Don't any of you run away.

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:53.360
Also...

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.519
If I hear...

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.519
you badmouthing me and my child again...

00:39:58.159 --> 00:39:59.480
don't blame me for overturning your stall...

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:00.519
and smashing your door.

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:03.000
Don't blame me for getting nasty.

00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:06.599
This radish is over a jin.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:09.039
Keep the change.
