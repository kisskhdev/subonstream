00:00:51.187 --> 00:00:54.300
(I once had a dream.)

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.420
(A dream that filled me with dread.)

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.300
(Could it be that today…)

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.700
(is the day this dream comes true?)

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.220
Come with me.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.700
Chu Ying.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:41.895
Chu Ying.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.300
Chu Ying.

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:48.895
Chu Ying.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.100
You're awake. How do you feel?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.260
Have you gone daft?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.820
This isn't a dream.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.740
What a surprise.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.140
You gave me quite a fright last night.

00:02:11.512 --> 00:02:13.392
I thought that nightmare had come true.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.095
It's so quiet.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:33.900
It's beautiful here.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.660
Where is this place?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.619
This is a lake

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.580
a few li outside the capital.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.620
The terrain nearby is complex.

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.300
The rebels can't track us here.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.380
Nor will it be easy for you to leave.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.580
What?

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.460
Afraid I might run off?

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.820
You won't let the rebels
overrun the capital.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.300
And I won't let you leave either.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.860
I have a question.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.780
Jia Yi and Sun Gong
are plotting rebellion.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.259
I assume the invasion

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.419
and this palace coup

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.140
are orchestrated by them.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.500
I've been investigating them in secret.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.060
They're connected to the Zhen clan case.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.740
I believe

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.059
Sun Gong is actually

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.780
Zhen Muyu,
who vanished twenty years ago.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.739
And

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.220
he calls Jia Yi "Uncle."

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.820
Uncle is an illegitimate son,

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.220
so he's not truly tied to the Zhen clan.

00:03:23.525 --> 00:03:24.245
However,

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.130
Father and Mother treated him
very well since childhood.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.750
An elder brother is like a father,
and his wife like a mother.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.700
In his heart,

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.180
they mattered more than his own parents.

00:03:34.487 --> 00:03:37.657
So they're your brother and your uncle.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.779
I've secretly tried

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.259
to stop Uncle and my brother

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.820
from colluding with foreign forces,

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.260
to prevent tragedy.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.860
But their resentment runs too deep.

00:03:51.087 --> 00:03:52.487
I couldn't turn things around.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.780
I had no choice but this last resort.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.620
You should've told me sooner.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.820
If I had,

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.579
back when you doubted

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.140
my purpose for returning,

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.020
what would you have done?

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.019
I would've joined forces with Aunt,

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.700
killed the two of them,

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.939
then placed you under house arrest

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.180
to eliminate any risks.

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.740
Just as I expected.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.340
So I allowed myself one selfish choice.

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.459
But things are different now.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.820
After learning
the full story behind this case,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.660
I can't bring myself to kill them.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.859
I, Chu Ying,
have always put the state first.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.740
This time, I'll be selfish too.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.540
I haven't told anyone.

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.020
Even my aunt is still in the dark.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.499
Trust me.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.380
I'll do everything I can
to resolve this feud.

00:04:39.962 --> 00:04:41.082
Thank you.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.620
I have another question.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.440
Your brother is my uncle-in-law.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.460
Doesn't that mean you're my elder?

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.420
Indeed.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.100
That would make me your aunt.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.100
I won't allow that.

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.499
You can only be my one and only...

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.540
Enough.

00:05:04.712 --> 00:05:06.019
At a time like this,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.260
it isn't appropriate.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.099
I have another question.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.140
Why were you in the hall?

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.020
I couldn't bear to see
someone dear to me

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.540
fight to the death.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:39.220
You didn't want to lose me, did you?

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.100
Chu Ying.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.820
Last night,
I didn't go there to save you.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.260
I know.

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:52.220
Jia Yi must've sent you to capture me.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.460
I defied my uncle's orders
and saved you.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.700
I meant to take you far away,

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:59.140
away from this blood feud.

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.300
I'd find us
a distant mountain near a river

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.660
and spend our lives there.

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.299
In those distant hills and rivers,

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.859
I'd farm, you'd weave,

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.900
and we'd raise a son and a daughter.
Wouldn't that be bliss?

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.980
What do you say?

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.380
Of course I'd want that.

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.940
But I can't promise you.

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.340
Xiao Man,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.500
as Chu Ying,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.099
I'd gladly cast everything aside

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.380
to live an unshackled life with you.

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.899
But as an emperor,

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.420
as the ruler of this realm,

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.140
I must stand
with the land and its people.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.540
The capital is in grave danger now.

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.659
Your elite forces are
all reinforcing the borders.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.059
How will you stand against my uncle?

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.499
As long as we stay together...

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.660
Enough.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.380
If I could abandon
my uncle and my brother,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.740
I wouldn't have
suffered all these years,

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.300
nor would I have brought you here.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.220
Xiao Man,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.020
we're both exhausted.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:57.870
Get some rest.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.260
Let me think.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.940
Come.

00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:58.860
Stop right there.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:05.410
So you've made up your mind to leave.

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:06.624
Yes.

00:09:06.625 --> 00:09:08.705
No matter what, I must face this.

00:09:09.462 --> 00:09:11.699
My uncle originally
planned to capture you alive,

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.900
then have you executed
before the rebel army.

00:09:14.687 --> 00:09:16.124
This force here

00:09:16.125 --> 00:09:17.999
was former soldiers of the Xiao Army.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.120
I know.

00:09:19.412 --> 00:09:21.131
They've been waiting for your return

00:09:21.132 --> 00:09:22.499
to use your flesh and blood

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.339
to appease my mother's soul.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.060
If that is truly the case,

00:09:27.425 --> 00:09:29.905
then this is my destiny.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:39.300
Chu Ying.

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:42.139
I'm torn between you
and my own kin.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.619
Can you understand how I feel?

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.100
Of course I can.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.700
Then for my sake,

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:49.620
will you yield?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:51.236
This is something I must face

00:09:51.237 --> 00:09:53.195
as a descendant of the Chu clan.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.900
I can't let the moment
I fear most come to pass.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.300
I will never let you

00:10:02.637 --> 00:10:04.597
walk toward your own death.

00:10:07.025 --> 00:10:09.705
All this tragedy was
caused by my father.

00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:11.739
I believe I owe

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:13.220
the Zhen clan justice.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:23.659
If the blood in me

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:26.140
that belongs to the Chu lineage
were to run dry,

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:28.980
would we return
to how we were as children?

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.570
Xiao Man.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:34.899
Once I leave,

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.940
I may never see you again.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:38.700
Before I go,

00:10:39.037 --> 00:10:41.597
will you dance with me?

Are you set on risking your life?

If I don't face this,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:46.860
neither of us will ever live in peace.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.420
Don't worry.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.260
I'm going back to resolve the hatred.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.420
Xiao Man,

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:54.540
come back with me.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.100
I can't.

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.819
I don't want to
face someone important to me

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:00.819
in a fight to the death.

00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:01.540
I...

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.460
Enough.

00:13:03.525 --> 00:13:04.645
I understand.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.380
Don't go.

00:13:10.512 --> 00:13:12.272
When everything is settled,

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:15.370
I'll still be waiting for your return.
