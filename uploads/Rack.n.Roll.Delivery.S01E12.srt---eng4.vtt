WEBVTT

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.799
Everything you did back then,

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:46.240
I'm paying it all back.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.719
Don't you want to know the truth about your ban?

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.079
That report of yours...

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:55.759
was actually mine.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.359
What did you say?

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.920
Let me go,

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.359
and I'll tell you.

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:12.400
Speak.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:15.239
Don't be in such a rush.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.599
Actually, you only have yourself to blame.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.319
Who told you back then

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:24.959
to refuse to fix the match?

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.920
So,

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:27.959
Jiang Nanshuo ordered me to perjure myself

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.560
and report you for match-fixing.

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:31.480
Hei Ba,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.120
I really should thank you

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.680
for taking that ten-year ban for me.

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.560
So it was you all along.

00:01:38.879 --> 00:01:39.920
You bunch of scumbags!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.719
You jerks!

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.480
Don't get angry just yet.

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:43.439
Don't get angry just yet.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.879
I have another wonderful show

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.280
prepared for you.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.959
An even better show.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:57.879
Wei Wei...

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:12.080
Hei Ba...

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.319
Jiang Nanshuo!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.039
You jerk!

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.840
You jerk!

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.199
Are you even human?

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:45.000
Why get so worked up?

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.560
Didn't my woman sleep with you for a night, too?

00:02:47.919 --> 00:02:49.240
As Wei Wei's ex-boyfriend,

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.400
you really are a failure.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.039
To not know what she went through before she died.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.680
Go to hell!

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.680
Kill me if you have the guts!

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.879
Nan-ge!

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:17.039
Don't do it here.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:22.439
Come with me.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.840
Let go of me!

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.680
Take him away.

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.479
Move!

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.080
Wait.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.199
You want to play with me?

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.560
I'll destroy you.

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.879
It's as easy as crushing an ant.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.599
Throw him out.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.879
Let's go.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.159
I'll see myself out.

00:03:59.479 --> 00:04:00.520
I've found the recently world-famous

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.080
Five Little Dragons of the East.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.159
Rumor has it,

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.960
aside from Captain Jack,

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:06.280
no one can beat them.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.960
Wouldn't it be better to just get Captain Jack?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.599
After the Inescapable Net Tournament,

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.639
Captain Jack never appeared again.

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.480
What if he suddenly shows up?

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.279
Why don't we

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:19.879
set a threshold for the competition?

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.720
Require a substantial deposit

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:22.920
to receive an invitation.

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.920
That way,

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.160
all the contestants

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.519
will be under our control.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.959
However...

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.439
However what?

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.480
The Five Little Dragons have a big appetite.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:34.319
With Liheng Group's current cash flow,

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:35.279
we can't satisfy their demands.

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.759
No matter how big their appetite,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.079
I have a way

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:42.000
to make them spit it all out after the match.

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:44.399
How much are we short?

00:04:44.959 --> 00:04:45.839
At least half.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:59.079
This is 40% of Liheng Group's shares.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.959
Pledge it to the Chaoli Group.

00:05:01.519 --> 00:05:02.959
Qujiang's wealthiest, the Chaoli Group?

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:04.959
Isn't that too risky?

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.519
Chaoli Group has always wanted to acquire Liheng.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.120
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.600
Do as I say.

00:05:13.399 --> 00:05:13.959
Understood.

00:05:47.399 --> 00:05:48.439
You're crazy!

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.959
You...

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.000
What do you want?

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.040
What are you doing?

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.160
Kidnapping a woman in broad daylight?

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:13.800
You've got some nerve!

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.279
You dare touch the boss's woman?

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.519
I'm taking you away.

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:20.600
Recently, Jiang Nanshuo

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.839
to revive the group's finances,

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:25.079
is organizing the Five Little Dragons of the East Tournament.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:27.680
I've lain low for years

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.680
just to send him to prison with my own hands.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.120
You go compete.

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:35.680
Defeat them.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.319
Sever all of Liheng's financial arteries.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.759
I just need to win.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:41.920
Right.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.680
You need to win a match.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.240
I'll handle the rest.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:48.240
Okay.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.480
Ever since I took over Nine Heavens Media,

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:57.879
I found that recruiting streamers is just a front.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.000
Some of them

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:02.560
are sent to the Red House,

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.519
while others

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.920
are sent to Kaye Mountain

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:09.000
to perform stripteases

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:10.839
and engage in the sex trade.

00:08:12.199 --> 00:08:13.720
Jiang Nanshuo is full of tricks.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.879
After doing so many evil deeds,

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.879
he still manages to get away scot-free.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.959
You are someone even more important

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:24.680
than myself.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.399
So no matter what,

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:29.480
I will help you get revenge.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:37.279
Kaye Mountain must be hiding

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:38.679
even more shady dealings.

00:08:40.399 --> 00:08:42.279
The Red House is just one of his bases.

00:08:43.399 --> 00:08:44.200
Unfortunately,

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:47.000
I haven't found solid evidence yet.

00:08:52.679 --> 00:08:53.639
I have to go there again.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.600
I'll go with you.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.399
Okay.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:09.759
Let's go.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.639
Who's there?
