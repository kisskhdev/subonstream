(All people, incidents,
and backgrounds...)

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.580
(in this drama are fictitious
and unrelated to reality.)

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.110
(Also, children were filmed
under production guidelines.)

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:07.910
She's refusing the surgery?

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.120
Are you saying
she didn't get the third surgery?

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.390
The patient herself refused.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.720
Our Seoul hospital had no choice
but to cancel the procedure.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.920
(Admissions, Registration)

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.230
Please, reschedule the surgery.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.200
She needs the surgery quickly
before the cancer spread.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.170
In that case, you need
to convince the patient first.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.000
When patients like Kim Dan Hui
give up on treatment,

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.310
it's because they don't want to be
a burden on their families.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.570
Can I see my sister now?

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.180
Yes, you should be able to visit her
in Ward B.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760
- Where could she have gone?
- She was here this morning...

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.000
Hold on.

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.630
Kim Dan Hui seems to be missing.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.230
(Dongwoo University Hospital)

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.530
Dan Hui!

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.270
Dan Hui, no!

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.620
Dan Hui.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.220
Please, don't do this.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:02.860
Come to me, please.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.800
Please.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.340
Dan Hui!

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.560
How did that happen?

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.330
Just come down, please.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.500
Answer me, darn it!

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.850
What's this?

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.050
Explain yourself. Now.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:05.690
Jung Ran!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.930
She said she was craving
some tart apples...

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:20.810
Jung Ran?

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.370
You can't mean...

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.880
That's right. It was that day.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.780
You came to the country house
two months ago.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.550
Two months ago?
The day we had that huge fight?

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.690
We may have fought,
but we shared a room that night.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.300
You passed out drunk in the bedroom,
and I did in the kitchen.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.170
And then, we...

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.930
I remember it clearly.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.770
What's with that look?

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.610
I'm pregnant with the child
you've always wanted.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.650
You having a child with someone else
tore me apart.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.750
That's right. I guess it's true...

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.790
that jealousy can lead to pregnancy.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.720
I'm carrying your child too.
The child you've always wanted...

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.190
is right here.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.440
Geun Tae.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:25.770
Yes, sir?

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:32.380
Call Dr. Do and make an appointment.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:39.880
Yes, sir.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.310
You're pregnant?

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.380
How?

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.950
After all these months, you show up
like this and don't say a word?

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.280
You're so worried about me,

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:16.520
- yet you meant to leave me and die?
- Myung Hui!

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.060
Why would you refuse the surgery?

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.430
If the cancer spreads,
there'll be nothing we can do.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.930
How could you give up
on your treatment...

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.070
- and climb up there to...
- I have to die for you to live.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.770
What?

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:34.770
It's all I've thought about lately.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.810
Why hasn't she come to see me?

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.610
Did something bad happen
that she has to hide from me?

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.650
Are my medical bills
ruining her life again?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.880
Because of me, is she...

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:46.780
It's not like that.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.060
This baby?

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.030
I met someone I love,

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.130
and I'm having his child.

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:03.270
Then why are you
only telling me now?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.110
Because I felt guilty.

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:13.710
With you being so sick,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.150
I felt guilty for being the only one
who was happy.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.190
I suppose...

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.030
this is my punishment.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.560
When you got better,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:36.000
I was going to tell you about him,
and vice versa.

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.340
You haven't told him about me yet?

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.740
I didn't want him
to get the wrong idea.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:47.980
That I was only with him
because you're sick...

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.350
and I needed the money
for your surgery.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.450
I didn't want us
to be like that because...

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.530
what I felt for him was real.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.460
Also,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.300
he was always so lonely
because he didn't have a family.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.540
Growing up without parents,
enduring all sorts of indignities...

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.010
That's you and me.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.080
It's the perfect jewel for us,
don't you think?

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.580
So...

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.020
I couldn't say I had a family
when he didn't,

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.850
or that I had a twin sister
who was adopted.

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:34.390
After the baby was born...

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.730
and we became a real family,

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.570
then...

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.100
Once he stopped feeling so lonely,

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:49.740
I was going to tell him.

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.110
You...

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.880
really do love him, don't you?

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.890
This baby...

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.020
and you as well...

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.690
I love you both so much...

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.530
that I'll do anything
to protect you.

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.480
Dan Hui?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.080
Dan Hui!

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.620
Dan Hui, what's wrong? Dan Hui!

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.320
Over here. Is anybody there?
Somebody help!

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.620
Over here!

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:39.390
Dan Hui, come on.
Dan Hui, what's wrong?

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.760
Somebody, please help us!

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:46.460
You recognize her, right?

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.630
I saw her going into the ward
over there a little while ago.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:51.870
What happened?

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:53.640
What's this about?

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:54.670
Oh, right.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.340
I'm on the job
and could use your help.

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.650
You must talk to the director first.
Without his permission,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.720
I can't just give out
patient information.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.390
Patient information? That means...

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.500
she's a patient here. I see.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:20.870
This should be enough
to report back.

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.810
Wait, should I have said she was
a guardian and not a patient?

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.340
Whatever.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.110
It doesn't matter. I can't give out
the information either way.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.150
- What the...
- My gosh.

00:09:40.590 --> 00:09:43.520
- I'm sorry.
- Unbelievable.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:53.630
Congratulations.
You waited a long time,

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.270
and a spot finally opened up.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:58.240
I wasn't expecting
to hear back so suddenly.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.710
It seems like they're rushing
because a spot opened up suddenly.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.740
Here, these are the documents
from the US.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:07.010
This is all you'll need.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.810
Thank you.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.980
When you said you were preparing
to study in the US,

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.550
I assumed you'd specialize
in obstetrics...

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.990
or forensic medicine,
since you like it.

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:20.390
I was surprised you chose
a different field like biotech.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.060
I'm thinking of taking over
my father's business.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.200
Really?

00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.800
Someone as smart and diligent as you
would do well in business, too.

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.540
Anyway, you'll need
to wrap things up at the hospital,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.040
so you must have a lot
on your plate.

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:38.810
I'm more worried about my wife
than the hospital.

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:41.780
The departure date is too close
to her delivery date.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.210
I can see that.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:46.050
Still, don't worry too much.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:48.390
She's with her husband,
who's an obstetrician.

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:49.820
What could possibly go wrong?

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:07.140
It's a real shame.
Her younger sister has cancer,

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.510
but she's stubbornly
refusing the surgery.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:11.740
Oh, really?

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.120
Dan Hui!

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.860
What is the matter with you?

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.700
You need to get your strength back
for your surgery in Seoul.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.930
This is already the third surgery.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.230
This might not even
be the end of it,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.600
and I could end up dying
after a lifetime of surgeries.

00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:45.340
I have to be realistic now.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.280
That's why I went up there.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:52.750
From now on,

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.090
take care of your life, not mine.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.690
I said I don't want to.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.030
You were supposed to be
the one to go from the start.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:10.530
I'm fine here.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.070
You're frail, so go to a good home,
be loved, and get treatment.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:20.850
No, I don't want to go alone
and leave you behind.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.450
Then are you going to stay like this
and die in pain?

00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:27.050
Mom and Dad are gone, so if you die,

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.550
I'll be all alone.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:53.140
Who do you think ruined my life?

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.450
Blaming me again, are you?

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:56.450
You were happy
about the adoption too.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:12:58.150
Then you should've chosen
a better one.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.390
You adopted a sick, unlucky kid,
and now we're bankrupt.

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.420
It was fine when we had money,
but now that we're broke, it's not?

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:07.220
If you'd run your business well,
there wouldn't be a problem!

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:10.460
We shouldn't have adopted her.
Kick her out.

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:12.500
Throw all of her things out!

00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:15.870
I'm so sick of this!
Fine, go ahead and smash everything!

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.400
Dan Hui.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.210
What are you doing here?

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.040
I'm so sorry.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.110
- Why?
- I should've checked in more often.

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:31.350
I found out too late...

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:34.120
that you were this sick
and all alone.

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:38.560
I'm sorry, Dan Hui.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.490
No matter what it takes,

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:41.890
I'll make you better.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.760
So you can't give up either. Okay?

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.530
Promise me already.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.370
I'm scared that you'll leave me.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.570
I'm so scared
that you'll leave me all alone.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:06.450
Back then,

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.590
the misery...

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.320
should have ended with just me.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:15.760
My selfish desire to live...

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:18.260
made you unhappy too.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.870
How can you say that?

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.900
You can't even be fully happy
because of me.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:30.010
You found someone you love,

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:32.540
and all you're worried about
is my surgery bills.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:37.510
I can't live like this anymore,
chipping away at your life.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.580
So...

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.450
you want me
to just let you die like this?

00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.760
How can I live alone without you?

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.100
- Alone...
- What's wrong with being alone?

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.500
That's just how life is.
You're not 12 anymore.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:59.600
You can live perfectly fine
even if I die.

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:06.540
It's best for everyone...

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.080
if I stop here.

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.950
Stopping?

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.920
How is that the best option?

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.590
The best thing to do
is try everything we can.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:23.690
I'm...

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.560
still like a 12-year-old kid.

00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.470
Dan Hui, a world without you
is too scary for me.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.980
That's why I can't give up
and run away.

00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.480
I can't live if I don't do this.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:48.050
So I have no choice
but to see it through to the end.

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:53.290
What about you?

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:58.560
Are you okay
with stopping like this?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.200
Are you really?

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:10.370
I'm begging you, Dan Hui.

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:13.110
Please, live for me.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:21.520
If I lose you,

00:16:24.250 --> 00:16:26.860
I might want to give up
on everything.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.200
Saving you will give me strength,

00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:35.630
and I need that strength
to protect my child too.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.600
Help me do that, Dan Hui.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.460
All the test results are normal,

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.830
and she's two months along.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.730
Right.

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.370
What about the special favor
I asked?

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:17.570
I spoke to the country house manager
where your wife was staying,

00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:20.740
and he said no outsiders
came or went.

00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:25.220
Okay, good work.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:30.650
I told you everything
after I came back from the checkup.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.920
Why would you doubt me
and call someone else to check?

00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:37.660
And what was that special favor
you asked for?

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.330
You don't need to know.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.100
I have to go back to the office.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.040
You get some rest.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.600
On a day like today,

00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:49.010
do you really have to go?

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.080
I'm busy with
the Wooju Department Store deal.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:57.510
Our Adele needs to establish itself
as a luxury jewelry brand...

00:17:57.710 --> 00:18:00.450
before we can expand to fashion,
cosmetics, food, and bio.

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:03.120
That's how we can paint
the bigger picture.

00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:04.720
Adele's future...

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:09.190
- depends on this contract.
- Then...

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:12.700
At least feel the baby
before you go.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.610
It's a little late,

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.210
but we officially have an heir.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:30.910
Having an official heir,
unlike your late father-in-law,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.890
means you've won. Doesn't it?

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.190
(Last Will and Testament)

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:50.670
How dare you?

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.500
How dare you lay a hand on my will?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.010
I can't just sit back
and let Munhwadang be taken away.

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:02.810
Munhwadang...

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.980
Munhwadang is our family business!

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.920
You aren't even family.

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.390
I'd never, ever give it to you!
You little...

00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:14.420
Wrong!

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:17.090
You're wrong.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.860
I'm the one who made Munhwadang
what it is today.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:25.970
It's a success I achieved
by enduring so much humiliation.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.210
Munhwadang will be my stepping stone
for a bigger,

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.510
brighter success.

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.610
I will build
the biggest corporation...

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.750
in this country,

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.780
spanning every sector.

00:19:41.250 --> 00:19:43.650
You snake!

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.860
Foolish old man.

00:19:48.590 --> 00:19:50.930
Fine. Just you wait.

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.730
Whatever you achieve,

00:19:54.670 --> 00:19:59.200
it will surely be stolen
by someone else.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.240
You, too, will suffer...

00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:04.640
the exact same fate.

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.610
Mark my words!

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:09.380
We'll see about that.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.130
Adele's heir is right here.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.200
I'll give you the son
your father-in-law never had.

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.030
A son?

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:30.730
We don't know
whether it's a boy or a girl yet.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.070
Of course it's going to be a son.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.340
Forget it. It doesn't matter.

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.410
Because soon my son,

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:46.120
the heir to Adele, will be born.

00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.420
What?

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.450
Don't tell me you're going to
name that wretch's brat your heir.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.560
Watch your mouth!

00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.960
He's a precious son
I was finally blessed with.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:20:59.130
Just you try bringing him here.

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:01.670
I'm your wife, the lady of Adele!

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.500
My child is the true heir to Adele!

00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.040
Darn it.

00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:11.240
(Dongwoo University Hospital)

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:28.630
Dan Hui.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:32.860
What are you doing here again?

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.630
Myung Hui asked me to.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.040
You see her
as a big sister so naturally,

00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.270
even though you're the same age.

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.470
We've been friends for ten years,
since middle school.

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.780
So your big sister's my big sister,
and my little brother's yours.

00:21:44.780 --> 00:21:46.310
That's just how it is with us.

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:49.010
I guess that's my famous loyalty.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.250
Without my loyalty,
I'm just skin and bones.

00:21:52.820 --> 00:21:54.120
That's how I can wear a size zero.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:02.160
You made the right choice.
Once you have the surgery in Seoul,

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.460
I'm sure it'll go well.

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:05.860
Myung Hui's devotion
didn't go unseen.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.700
It's about time
the universe noticed.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.270
Right.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:19.080
Wait here.
I'll go check if our cab is here.

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.790
Up there in the sky,

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.730
if someone really is listening,

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:43.700
you must already know.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.670
I have never once been okay.

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.550
I was always in pain,

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.520
I was scared,

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.860
and I wanted to live.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.190
Please, let me live.

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.330
So I can stay by my sister's side.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.230
So I can protect her.

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.270
Please help me.

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:32.080
Well, Jung Ran...

00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:38.320
Why does this have to be
so darn delicious?

00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:41.390
They say these cravings mean a girl.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.060
What if I have a girl
when she's having a boy?

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.100
You can forget about an heir.
He wouldn't even acknowledge her.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.800
There's no way.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.840
Thinking there's no way
is exactly how you get blindsided.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:58.680
I guess I have no choice
but to take care of it.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640
Take care of it?

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.580
You mean you'll leave Tae Ho
and be with me?

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.390
My child will be Tae Ho's only child.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:11.250
What?

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:13.590
Park Tae Ho's child?

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:19.630
I'll take everything Park Tae Ho has
and hand it all to my child.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:22.530
It doesn't matter
if it's a son or a daughter,

00:24:23.330 --> 00:24:26.170
as long as they become
Adele's heir and owner.

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.940
Adele's heir and owner?

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:35.150
Rather than live
my whole life with regret,

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:37.280
I'm going to do what I have to.

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.020
Why are you giving me
that look again?

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.590
What are you plotting now?

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.380
Even if you don't have an appetite,

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:14.950
you have to think of the baby.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:17.920
Here, have a bite.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.730
Right.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.200
I'm putting you out, aren't I?

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.070
I'm sorry.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.540
I know I'm being a burden,

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:43.450
but I just can't find the courage
to go back to that house.

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.950
Tell me about it.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.220
If I were you, I couldn't set foot
in that house either.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.460
Just hearing about it
makes my blood boil.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.260
I can't imagine how you must feel.

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:02.330
You can stay here for the rest
of your life if you want,

00:26:03.270 --> 00:26:04.270
so just make yourself at home.

00:26:10.810 --> 00:26:12.140
Thank you, ma'am.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:23.250
Nurse Myung Hui.

00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:27.220
Are you crying
because the baby's clothes got ruined?

00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:31.530
I made it pretty for you,

00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.860
so don't cry.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:48.950
It's beautiful.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:52.780
Really?
So you won't cry anymore, right?

00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:55.550
I won't.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:01.660
The stains on my heart...

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.590
have turned
into something beautiful,

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.170
so I won't cry anymore.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:11.570
I think I can be brave now.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:17.240
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.090
I think that's the house over there.

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:11.660
I know you wanted to come as soon
as you got out of the hospital,

00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:14.160
but we should've called first.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.800
Showing up like this
might startle Myung Hui.

00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:20.170
I wanted to see
what her life was really like.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.770
How she's living,
and what the man she loves is like.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:27.640
- I had to see it with my own eyes.
- I get it.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.180
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:06.820
Do they live here too?

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.520
Where are you going?

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.230
Myung Hui.

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:19.660
Myung Hui?

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200
Myung Hui.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.310
Myung Hui!

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:31.140
Dan Hui.

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:37.950
- Myung Hui!
- What?

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:41.350
Myung Hui, come on. Wake up!

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.920
Myung Hui, what's wrong? Myung Hui!

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.720
Myung Hui, open your eyes!

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.560
Myung Hui!

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.460
- Myung Hui!
- Oh no, what do we do?

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:52.830
Myung Hui, what's wrong?

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:56.900
(Emergency Medical Center)

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.100
Help! Somebody, please!

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:04.040
(Emergency Medical Center)

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.310
She's a pregnant patient in her 20s.

00:30:11.950 --> 00:30:14.480
There's no visible trauma,
but she's pulseless, not breathing.

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:16.090
Please save her, Doctor.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:30.470
Please.

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.750
I'm sorry.
The patient has passed away.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:46.550
No. You can still save her.

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:49.750
My sister isn't one
to give up so easily.

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:51.150
Myung Hui.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:54.520
Myung Hui, you told me.

00:30:55.930 --> 00:30:58.630
You said you'd do what it takes
to live, until the very end.

00:30:58.830 --> 00:31:02.000
Myung Hui!

00:31:02.530 --> 00:31:05.200
Myung Hui, come on. Breathe.

00:31:05.770 --> 00:31:07.740
Myung Hui, please.

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.180
The baby's alive.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:22.590
The baby's alive!

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:57.820
(Pearl in Red)

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:00.990
Both babies were born the same day,
at the exact same time.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.360
- The baby's alive.
- Take the baby away right now.

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:06.730
Hurry, before Park Tae Ho
gets to him first!

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.500
What if we get caught?

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:10.400
He just lost the son
he'd been waiting for.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.000
Do you think Tae Ho
will just let it go?

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:15.910
Don't worry. I know someone
who can handle this without a trace.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:19.510
I can't lose the baby
my sister died to protect.

00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:21.440
That's right! I killed her.

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:22.710
Dan Hui!

00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.550
I'm done begging for your love.

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.520
My child will be Adele's heir
and take over.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.520
That's all I'm living for now.

00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:31.820
