00:00:32.664 --> 00:00:34.164
I don't care if this is the worst.

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:36.574
If it means I can protect you.

00:00:38.874 --> 00:00:42.744
If I can make them feel my sorrow and rage,

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:46.114
my very life and soul,

00:00:47.144 --> 00:00:48.414
I'd gladly give them up.

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:02.664
How?

00:01:10.574 --> 00:01:13.604
What? No way, this is impossible.

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:26.624
- A ghost! It's a ghost! - Sir!

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:29.894
What's going on out here?

00:01:42.564 --> 00:01:44.574
You are the lord of this chaos.

00:01:59.184 --> 00:02:00.184
No!

00:02:01.624 --> 00:02:02.784
No!

00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:05.654
What is this?

00:02:05.954 --> 00:02:07.764
How can a dead person be here?

00:02:08.424 --> 00:02:09.894
You're dead.

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:13.404
- I know for a fact you're dead! - I was.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:15.704
I did die.

00:02:17.634 --> 00:02:19.674
A dead woman came back from the grave.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:26.214
Just for you.

00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:13.564
(Pearl in Red)

00:03:16.494 --> 00:03:19.394
(Year 1997)

00:03:26.544 --> 00:03:27.974
(Episode 1)

00:03:32.544 --> 00:03:36.714
Don’t you worry. The fever’s broken, so everything will be all right.

00:03:37.754 --> 00:03:38.914
Oh, goodness, thank you.

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:43.854
It really makes a difference having a nurse here.

00:03:47.294 --> 00:03:48.824
If it weren't for you,

00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:51.894
my grandson would've been in real trouble.

00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:57.204
I tried to handle it myself,

00:03:57.574 --> 00:03:59.304
but I just made the poor thing suffer more.

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:04.674
Please don't say that. You're doing all you can for him.

00:04:06.044 --> 00:04:07.744
What good am I?

00:04:08.344 --> 00:04:11.414
Truth be told, he's the one who's keeping me going.

00:04:12.754 --> 00:04:15.724
After losing my son and his wife on the very same day,

00:04:16.124 --> 00:04:18.094
the only reason I'm still holding on...

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:20.794
is all thanks to this little one.

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:22.724
To me,

00:04:23.434 --> 00:04:27.864
he's my only family left, my only reason for living.

00:04:29.664 --> 00:04:32.734
I was so terrified I was going to lose my grandson too.

00:04:34.144 --> 00:04:36.844
I know that feeling all too well.

00:04:38.174 --> 00:04:42.684
I also have someone precious I'd do anything to protect.

00:04:43.084 --> 00:04:44.684
Of course you do.

00:04:45.554 --> 00:04:46.554
After all,

00:04:47.484 --> 00:04:49.954
you're a mother with your own child to protect now.

00:04:51.394 --> 00:04:52.924
Oh dear, anyway...

00:04:54.624 --> 00:04:59.664
I can't believe I made you come here when you're pregnant.

00:05:00.034 --> 00:05:04.734
You must've been tired all morning. I feel so bad for troubling you.

00:05:04.874 --> 00:05:05.934
I'm so sorry.

00:05:06.474 --> 00:05:10.474
- Not at all. I'm really okay. - How could you be?

00:05:11.614 --> 00:05:14.184
It must have been hard on the baby, too.

00:05:16.954 --> 00:05:18.184
Oh, little one.

00:05:18.784 --> 00:05:20.084
I'm sorry.

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:24.254
See? My baby says it's okay.

00:05:26.794 --> 00:05:30.094
The baby's sweet because you are.

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:32.394
Have you picked out a name yet?

00:05:33.764 --> 00:05:36.004
No, not yet.

00:05:36.264 --> 00:05:39.534
You should pick out a good name ahead of time.

00:05:40.074 --> 00:05:44.444
You don't want to rush to pick one for the birth certificate.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:46.784
I will.

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.154
Honey.

00:05:58.894 --> 00:06:02.394
You're back early. Was your business trip cut short?

00:06:02.464 --> 00:06:05.834
Where have you been so early in the morning?

00:06:05.894 --> 00:06:08.634
I was at the blue-roofed house, down the hill.

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:12.634
The woman who lives there is alone, so I helped with her sick grandson.

00:06:13.944 --> 00:06:16.844
You were nursing a sick child in your condition?

00:06:17.514 --> 00:06:19.044
All the way down the hill?

00:06:19.774 --> 00:06:21.014
It was really no trouble...

00:06:25.354 --> 00:06:28.454
It's not fine by my standards.

00:06:28.624 --> 00:06:30.724
Stop getting involved in things that don't concern you.

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:33.324
Stay away from the people down there.

00:06:33.524 --> 00:06:37.594
We are kept separate for a very good reason.

00:06:37.934 --> 00:06:41.364
You need to start acting like you belong up here, not down there.

00:06:52.714 --> 00:06:55.644
You must have rushed back from your trip...

00:06:55.914 --> 00:06:59.484
and been worried when I wasn't here this morning.

00:07:03.454 --> 00:07:07.524
I'm sorry for worrying you and for upsetting you.

00:07:19.334 --> 00:07:20.344
Here.

00:07:21.904 --> 00:07:24.044
- What's this? - Open it.

00:07:31.714 --> 00:07:33.324
It's a pearl necklace.

00:07:35.024 --> 00:07:37.054
That's right. Here.

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:43.434
You know, these pearls...

00:07:43.964 --> 00:07:47.334
They symbolize purity and nobility.

00:07:52.574 --> 00:07:56.874
A pure and noble gem born out of great suffering.

00:07:57.374 --> 00:08:01.384
Growing up without parents, enduring all sorts of indignities...

00:08:01.684 --> 00:08:02.784
That's you and me.

00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:05.954
It's the perfect jewel for us, don't you think?

00:08:06.214 --> 00:08:10.354
They say pearls help ensure a safe delivery, so take it.

00:08:10.894 --> 00:08:12.924
When I get back from my next business trip,

00:08:14.024 --> 00:08:16.294
I'll bring you even bigger pearls.

00:08:16.964 --> 00:08:17.964
Actually,

00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:23.404
- can I ask for something else? - What's that?

00:08:24.434 --> 00:08:28.744
Before we have the wedding, I'd like to register our marriage.

00:08:29.704 --> 00:08:34.144
Like you said, we can take our time with the wedding.

00:08:34.214 --> 00:08:37.284
In fact, I don't mind if we don't have a wedding at all.

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:40.524
But with the baby coming soon,

00:08:41.584 --> 00:08:45.154
we need to be legally married to register the birth.

00:09:02.374 --> 00:09:04.414
Another business trip already? Without even a day of rest?

00:09:04.414 --> 00:09:06.344
Yes, I've got a lot to take care of.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:11.214
If this is about registering our marriage...

00:09:13.284 --> 00:09:15.084
I'll take care of it.

00:09:16.254 --> 00:09:18.194
Don't you worry about a thing.

00:09:18.924 --> 00:09:20.624
Just focus on yourself and the baby.

00:09:22.564 --> 00:09:25.634
Right. And about that money you asked for...

00:09:28.804 --> 00:09:32.234
The same amount as last time should be fine, right?

00:09:33.234 --> 00:09:35.474
Yes. I'm sorry to ask.

00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:37.774
This is already the third time.

00:09:38.244 --> 00:09:40.044
You never even ask what it's for.

00:09:40.344 --> 00:09:41.644
That's...

00:09:42.784 --> 00:09:44.754
how much I trust you.

00:09:47.054 --> 00:09:49.084
And just as much as I trust you,

00:09:49.984 --> 00:09:52.054
I hope you can trust me too.

00:09:52.994 --> 00:09:56.424
I do trust you. More than you know.

00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:01.134
I'll get going.

00:10:07.504 --> 00:10:10.514
- Go inside. It's cold. - Have a safe trip.

00:10:32.094 --> 00:10:34.034
Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.

00:10:35.134 --> 00:10:38.434
He's been so good to me, and he's just so lonely.

00:10:39.134 --> 00:10:40.844
I just made things awkward for him.

00:10:43.614 --> 00:10:47.284
I should apologise to your father when he gets back. Right?

00:10:50.044 --> 00:10:54.624
When you're born, we'll finally be a real family.

00:10:56.124 --> 00:10:59.524
Let's give your father the gift of a warm, loving family.

00:11:11.934 --> 00:11:16.474
Jung Ran, come on. Wait! Just wait a minute!

00:11:17.074 --> 00:11:19.074
Whatever you're thinking, this is not the answer.

00:11:19.144 --> 00:11:21.684
What are you talking about? Get out of my way!

00:11:21.744 --> 00:11:25.014
Come on, just use your head for a second.

00:11:25.184 --> 00:11:29.284
She's pregnant and in the villa now, practically rubbing it in your face.

00:11:29.354 --> 00:11:33.254
I'm telling you, it's game over. Don't waste time getting worked up.

00:11:33.494 --> 00:11:36.994
Instead, maybe you and I can give it a go...

00:11:37.234 --> 00:11:38.564
Move your head already.

00:11:39.594 --> 00:11:41.334
How dare she try to steal him from me?

00:11:57.854 --> 00:11:58.854
You!

00:11:59.854 --> 00:12:02.184
You wretch!

00:12:03.024 --> 00:12:04.124
What is this?

00:12:04.494 --> 00:12:06.594
What gives you the right to barge into my home like this?

00:12:06.594 --> 00:12:09.264
Your home? I don't think so.

00:12:09.624 --> 00:12:12.334
Says the wretch who's shacked up in a home that isn't hers.

00:12:12.634 --> 00:12:15.664
How dare you throw yourself at my husband?

00:12:15.664 --> 00:12:16.834
Your husband?

00:12:16.974 --> 00:12:20.474
What? You think you've got it all because you're carrying his son?

00:12:20.774 --> 00:12:22.944
You saw him doting on his heir...

00:12:22.944 --> 00:12:24.274
and figured you were set, didn't you?

00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:27.444
You've got the villa, and now you're trying to replace me...

00:12:27.514 --> 00:12:28.644
as the lady of Adele Group?

00:12:29.344 --> 00:12:30.454
Wait a minute.

00:12:30.854 --> 00:12:33.924
Husband? I think you’re mistaken.

00:12:34.284 --> 00:12:37.454
- He told me he was a widower. - Right.

00:12:38.024 --> 00:12:40.694
I'm standing here, kindly telling you...

00:12:40.694 --> 00:12:42.764
this isn't a mistake and I'm not dead.

00:12:43.664 --> 00:12:44.834
So listen up.

00:12:45.594 --> 00:12:47.834
Just because you gave him a son doesn't mean anything will change.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:49.864
To Park Tae Ho,

00:12:50.474 --> 00:12:53.604
you're just a tool to give him an heir. That's all.

00:13:03.184 --> 00:13:06.814
Please, stop. If all this stress harms the baby,

00:13:06.884 --> 00:13:08.124
it's going to cause problems.

00:13:08.484 --> 00:13:11.654
Like I care! I've put up with enough.

00:13:11.894 --> 00:13:15.294
I let him cheat with a tramp since I couldn't give him a child.

00:13:15.564 --> 00:13:18.894
And I put up with being banished to the countryside for my health.

00:13:19.494 --> 00:13:21.634
But he brings this homewrecker into our villa?

00:13:22.604 --> 00:13:23.604
You said it yourself.

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:25.704
Next, he'll move her into the master bedroom.

00:13:25.904 --> 00:13:28.174
Shouldn't I just nip it in the bud before that happens?

00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:31.714
I meant you should end things with your husband.

00:13:31.774 --> 00:13:32.774
Shut it!

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:36.614
Darn.

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:39.884
- What do you think you're doing? - What does it look like I'm doing?

00:13:40.554 --> 00:13:42.184
- Please, stop. - Let go of me.

00:13:43.424 --> 00:13:46.094
Stop it. Don't do it. Don't!

00:13:46.824 --> 00:13:47.864
You see that?

00:13:48.194 --> 00:13:50.264
Next time, it'll be your baby getting stomped on.

00:13:52.334 --> 00:13:54.804
If you want to protect your baby, then you'd better watch your step.

00:13:55.004 --> 00:13:58.004
Stay away from Park Tae Ho. Got it?

00:14:01.044 --> 00:14:02.044
Let's go.

00:14:23.294 --> 00:14:25.064
- President Park. - Right.

00:14:26.794 --> 00:14:28.934
- How's the baby? - The baby's fine.

00:14:31.504 --> 00:14:33.874
So what are you going to do now?

00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:38.444
You lied about being married to get her to have your child,

00:14:38.674 --> 00:14:40.744
and now she knows you were just using her.

00:14:41.614 --> 00:14:44.884
What if Nurse Kim just runs off? That would be a problem.

00:15:15.044 --> 00:15:16.044
I...

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:18.884
More than anyone else's,

00:15:20.254 --> 00:15:22.024
I'll believe your words.

00:15:23.894 --> 00:15:24.954
So,

00:15:26.054 --> 00:15:29.224
whether it's an excuse or an explanation,

00:15:30.534 --> 00:15:32.094
just tell me the truth.

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:36.964
Are you really a married man?

00:15:37.974 --> 00:15:39.674
You told me you were a widower.

00:15:40.474 --> 00:15:42.274
Was that a lie?

00:15:45.744 --> 00:15:47.814
It's true that my wife passed away.

00:15:48.544 --> 00:15:50.044
That marriage...

00:15:52.184 --> 00:15:53.584
That's how it ended.

00:15:55.984 --> 00:15:58.254
"That" marriage?

00:15:58.794 --> 00:16:00.694
Until five years ago,

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:03.624
I was at Munhwadang, a well-known jewellery house,

00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:05.894
and I had married into the owner's family.

00:16:08.464 --> 00:16:10.574
My current business...

00:16:13.604 --> 00:16:14.974
is also in jewellery.

00:16:18.414 --> 00:16:20.414
(Adele, President Park Tae Ho)

00:16:20.474 --> 00:16:24.454
Five years ago, both my wife and father-in-law passed away,

00:16:26.754 --> 00:16:29.954
so I took over Munhwadang and made it the Adele you see today.

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.894
The woman who came to see you...

00:16:34.694 --> 00:16:37.794
is the one who helped me secure the inheritance from Munhwadang.

00:16:40.664 --> 00:16:43.704
It's just a marriage of convenience for the business.

00:16:45.674 --> 00:16:46.704
Even in the future,

00:16:48.074 --> 00:16:50.714
it'll be difficult to get a divorce.

00:16:55.784 --> 00:16:57.554
Don't look at me like that.

00:16:58.014 --> 00:17:01.924
Our child will legally be mine, and you'll continue...

00:17:03.854 --> 00:17:05.954
living a life in comfort.

00:17:07.324 --> 00:17:08.664
What are you talking about?

00:17:11.364 --> 00:17:13.634
Is that really all you have to say to me?

00:17:15.304 --> 00:17:16.304
What else?

00:17:18.234 --> 00:17:20.274
Do you expect me to apologise or something?

00:17:23.004 --> 00:17:25.574
Just because you gave him a son doesn't mean anything will change.

00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:27.584
To Park Tae Ho,

00:17:28.244 --> 00:17:31.584
you're just a tool to give him an heir. That's all.

00:17:34.254 --> 00:17:35.254
Why...

00:17:36.154 --> 00:17:37.554
did you lie to me?

00:17:40.524 --> 00:17:42.724
Why didn't you say anything...

00:17:44.334 --> 00:17:46.264
until I was pregnant with your child?

00:17:50.334 --> 00:17:52.434
I did it for you.

00:17:54.344 --> 00:17:57.104
Have you already forgotten the circumstances of how we met?

00:18:00.144 --> 00:18:02.284
Do I owe you money or something?

00:18:02.544 --> 00:18:05.654
I already said no. Why won't you take no for an answer?

00:18:06.314 --> 00:18:09.824
I'm sorry. It's just that I'm really desperate.

00:18:10.054 --> 00:18:13.994
I don't care how desperate you are. You've only been here two weeks,

00:18:14.064 --> 00:18:16.224
and you're already hounding me for money?

00:18:17.024 --> 00:18:20.294
I gave you a chance because I heard you had it rough as an orphan.

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:23.534
Do you have to act like you grew up without parents?

00:18:23.704 --> 00:18:24.704
Please...

00:18:25.334 --> 00:18:26.734
Please help me out just this once.

00:18:26.734 --> 00:18:30.144
That's an awful lot of money for a "one-time" favour.

00:18:30.344 --> 00:18:32.774
You're asking for an entire year's salary.

00:18:33.044 --> 00:18:35.244
Who's going to give you that kind of money?

00:18:36.784 --> 00:18:37.814
I will.

00:18:41.984 --> 00:18:45.324
That money may be hard for a family man to give up,

00:18:47.054 --> 00:18:50.564
but it's nothing for an orphan like me.

00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:51.764
Excuse me.

00:18:53.094 --> 00:18:54.964
Would you allow me to help you?

00:19:08.844 --> 00:19:10.884
I've wanted a child for a long time.

00:19:12.314 --> 00:19:14.854
My wife couldn't conceive.

00:19:16.624 --> 00:19:19.654
I was looking for another woman to bear my child.

00:19:19.654 --> 00:19:21.994
I came to see Dr. Do because of it,

00:19:22.294 --> 00:19:23.464
and that's when I saw you.

00:19:24.894 --> 00:19:25.894
So...

00:19:28.234 --> 00:19:31.474
From the very beginning, you were just planning on using me.

00:19:33.234 --> 00:19:34.444
From the very beginning...

00:19:34.904 --> 00:19:37.714
If I had told you everything from the start,

00:19:38.174 --> 00:19:40.714
if I'd said I was just paying you to have my child,

00:19:43.014 --> 00:19:44.714
you still would've taken my offer...

00:19:45.784 --> 00:19:46.814
and my money.

00:19:48.054 --> 00:19:49.754
You couldn't have turned it down.

00:19:51.324 --> 00:19:55.094
Because I kept my mouth shut, you got to play Cinderella,

00:19:56.064 --> 00:19:58.094
and live out a happy fantasy.

00:19:58.994 --> 00:20:01.004
- Am I wrong? - Stop!

00:20:01.004 --> 00:20:03.504
Stop being a fool and just look the other way.

00:20:03.964 --> 00:20:05.634
Keep pretending to be oblivious,

00:20:06.734 --> 00:20:07.744
and I'll let you stay...

00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:11.344
in this happy dream.

00:20:14.784 --> 00:20:18.154
My dream has already turned into a nightmare.

00:20:20.154 --> 00:20:22.284
The happiness I felt with you...

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:25.624
was all just an illusion.

00:20:28.724 --> 00:20:30.364
The minute I get out of this hospital,

00:20:32.434 --> 00:20:33.594
I'm leaving you.

00:20:40.274 --> 00:20:43.804
You make leaving sound so easy.

00:20:47.544 --> 00:20:50.184
Did our relationship mean so little to you?

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:53.284
You're the one who took our relationship so lightly.

00:20:53.354 --> 00:20:57.694
Fine, whatever you say. It doesn't change anything.

00:20:59.894 --> 00:21:02.294
Regardless of who started this casually,

00:21:03.494 --> 00:21:07.094
I have no intention of letting it end so easily. Got it?

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:13.634
It'd be a waste to lose a woman as perfect for the role as you.

00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:15.504
You're healthy, unmarried,

00:21:15.504 --> 00:21:17.344
and you have no family ties to complicate things.

00:21:17.344 --> 00:21:21.314
Plus, you're desperate for money, so I'll use you to the fullest.

00:21:22.084 --> 00:21:23.484
Right?

00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.314
Isn't that right?

00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:35.894
Here.

00:21:37.894 --> 00:21:39.094
Here's that money you love so much.

00:21:39.364 --> 00:21:42.064
So take the money, shut your mouth, look the other way,

00:21:43.834 --> 00:21:45.404
and go on living in your nightmare.

00:21:48.944 --> 00:21:49.974
Oh, right.

00:21:49.974 --> 00:21:52.014
Considering all the money I've already given you,

00:21:53.114 --> 00:21:56.584
this isn't such a bad deal for you, is it?

00:22:41.164 --> 00:22:42.394
Hey, it's me.

00:22:45.694 --> 00:22:48.264
Could you send one of your guys over?

00:22:50.904 --> 00:22:54.004
Someone discreet who can run an errand for me.

00:22:56.604 --> 00:22:57.614
Right.

00:23:47.054 --> 00:23:49.764
If I had told you everything from the start,

00:23:50.664 --> 00:23:52.964
if I'd said I was just paying you to have my child,

00:23:54.504 --> 00:23:56.104
you still would've taken my offer...

00:23:57.034 --> 00:23:58.234
and my money.

00:23:59.474 --> 00:24:00.904
You couldn't have turned it down.

00:25:36.764 --> 00:25:37.774
This is driving me crazy.

00:25:42.344 --> 00:25:43.374
Jung Ran, come on.

00:25:43.374 --> 00:25:46.014
Let's just go back to the countryside.

00:25:46.214 --> 00:25:50.484
President Park must be furious. We need to lie low for a while.

00:25:52.214 --> 00:25:54.284
Lie low? Why should I?

00:25:54.754 --> 00:25:58.124
- I have nothing left to lose now. - Nothing to lose? That's absurd.

00:25:58.594 --> 00:26:01.194
The only reason you're not going in is because you're scared of him too.

00:26:01.464 --> 00:26:03.694
You're just sitting here, chewing apples you don't even like.

00:26:03.764 --> 00:26:05.894
I know you're just stalling.

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:08.104
As if you know anything.

00:26:09.264 --> 00:26:13.474
I'm not eating these to stall. I'm eating to get my strength up.

00:26:13.734 --> 00:26:17.344
I'm stocking up on strength before I face Park Tae Ho.

00:26:30.424 --> 00:26:31.424
What's with you?

00:26:31.754 --> 00:26:33.854
If you're going in there to say your piece,

00:26:34.694 --> 00:26:36.864
I can't just stand by. Not as a man.

00:26:37.564 --> 00:26:38.764
A man? Please.

00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:42.734
Fine. If that's how it is, then come in with me and...

00:26:43.834 --> 00:26:45.434
I'll go get you some more apples.

00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:47.304
Apples?

00:26:48.544 --> 00:26:50.744
You'll need more if you run out of juice mid-argument.

00:26:52.644 --> 00:26:56.014
You can count on me. I'll man up...

00:26:56.184 --> 00:26:59.054
and get you the reddest, tartest ones I can find.

00:27:00.254 --> 00:27:01.254
All right?

00:27:06.754 --> 00:27:08.994
Figures. That darn coward.

00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:12.464
I should've let him freeze to death. I regret ever helping him.

00:27:13.194 --> 00:27:15.334
I've put up with him for ten years,

00:27:15.334 --> 00:27:17.434
and he's still only good for driving.

00:27:22.104 --> 00:27:23.204
Whatever.

00:27:23.774 --> 00:27:25.974
I can handle Tae Ho just fine on my own.

00:27:26.944 --> 00:27:29.644
I didn't fight this hard to become the lady of Adele Group for nothing.

00:27:51.874 --> 00:27:53.974
Goodness, you scared me!

00:27:54.844 --> 00:27:56.244
You scared the wits out of me.

00:27:57.444 --> 00:28:01.114
How dare you set foot in my house after what you did?

00:28:02.284 --> 00:28:03.484
Get lost this second.

00:28:03.944 --> 00:28:06.514
This is my house too.

00:28:07.154 --> 00:28:09.254
After all I went through to become the lady of Adele Group?

00:28:10.584 --> 00:28:11.594
What the...

00:28:12.224 --> 00:28:15.164
I'd give you up before I'd give up my place in this house.

00:28:17.094 --> 00:28:18.194
Oh Jung Ran.

00:28:19.294 --> 00:28:21.764
My patience with you has run out.

00:28:22.634 --> 00:28:25.774
Go back to the countryside and don't make a peep.

00:28:26.134 --> 00:28:28.944
I can't. Over my dead body.

00:28:30.774 --> 00:28:32.374
I have a stake in this family too.

00:28:33.174 --> 00:28:34.344
You may think you're high and mighty,

00:28:34.344 --> 00:28:35.744
but none of this would be yours...

00:28:35.744 --> 00:28:37.114
if I hadn't tampered with your late father-in-law's will.

00:28:37.744 --> 00:28:40.514
You only got his entire fortune thanks to me.

00:28:41.214 --> 00:28:44.754
Ever since, I've done everything you asked and put up with it all.

00:28:45.494 --> 00:28:49.294
You could at least cut me some slack this one time.

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.994
How much more slack do I have to give you?

00:28:53.164 --> 00:28:55.404
You were my late wife's maid, but I took you in...

00:28:55.404 --> 00:28:57.664
and made you the lady of this house.

00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:59.734
I put up with you for five years...

00:28:59.734 --> 00:29:01.644
even though you couldn't give me a son.

00:29:02.044 --> 00:29:04.844
I have shown you more patience than you could ever deserve.

00:29:05.544 --> 00:29:09.584
And you still have the audacity to go after my son?

00:29:11.314 --> 00:29:13.354
If I hadn't been so patient, you...

00:29:16.184 --> 00:29:18.254
You would already be in your coffin.

00:29:20.794 --> 00:29:21.794
Darling...

00:29:21.894 --> 00:29:24.464
If you understand me, get out now!

00:29:37.804 --> 00:29:38.814
What's this?

00:29:46.014 --> 00:29:47.254
Explain yourself. Now.

00:30:03.604 --> 00:30:06.334
(Dongwoo University Hospital)

00:30:08.074 --> 00:30:09.074
Dan Hui!

00:30:11.874 --> 00:30:13.144
Dan Hui, no!

00:30:32.894 --> 00:30:33.894
Dan Hui.

00:30:35.434 --> 00:30:36.464
Please, don't do this.

00:30:39.434 --> 00:30:41.004
Come to me, please.

00:30:44.644 --> 00:30:45.744
Please.

00:30:57.724 --> 00:30:58.754
Dan Hui!

00:31:23.584 --> 00:31:26.514
(Pearl in Red)

00:31:26.984 --> 00:31:28.184
She's refusing the surgery?

00:31:28.254 --> 00:31:31.354
It's a real shame. Her younger sister has cancer,

00:31:31.454 --> 00:31:33.524
but she's stubbornly refusing the surgery.

00:31:33.594 --> 00:31:36.794
I'm begging you, Dan Hui. Please, live for me.

00:31:36.864 --> 00:31:39.494
- What's with that look? - It's none of your business.

00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:42.664
I'm pregnant with the child you've always wanted.

00:31:42.834 --> 00:31:46.674
- I guess I'll have to end it. - You can't mean...

00:31:46.734 --> 00:31:47.734
You know this person, right?

00:31:47.734 --> 00:31:49.704
I'm on the job and could use your help.

00:31:50.244 --> 00:31:52.474
Hold on. The patient, Kim Dan Hui, is missing.

00:31:52.574 --> 00:31:56.244
Dan Hui? Dan Hui! Over here. Is anybody there?

00:31:56.384 --> 00:31:58.584
Somebody help! Over here!
