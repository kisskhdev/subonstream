Someone once said that…

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.400
Sun Atita is like the sun

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.760
Shining among the crowd

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.200
Always standing out and beautiful.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.680
I don’t know how I got to this point

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.000
Perhaps it was destiny

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.560
Chance

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.319
Or maybe it was because of that one person

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.120
The one I want to be worthy enough for

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.280
To one day stand by their side.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.480
Flint

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.840
Congratulations.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.720
I heard you got the highest GPA in the year.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.920
Thank you.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.520
P’Flint, could you write it for me?

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.720
Sure.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.280
But…

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.240
where do you want me to write it?

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.479
Um...

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.120
Here, then.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.000
If this were the ending of a story…

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.440
Then there would be no reason for me to keep these feelings to myself.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.320
(Good luck, Sun)

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.240
I like you

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.240
I know that you are Fay's sister

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.760
but if I don't tell P’Flint right now…

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.240
I might never get the chance to tell you again.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.240
I like you, P'Flint.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.520
Sun...

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.640
Sun...

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.079
Sun...

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.480
Are you okay?

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.400
Yes.. I'm fine.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.200
Here you go.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.200
Thank you.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.240
P'Flint!!

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.160
But in reality

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.120
I’m not brave enough to even say it.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.080
Why isn't she picking up?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.760
or still asleep?

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.520
Hello, what’s up, Fay? You’re calling pretty early.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.200
Early? It’s almost ten already.

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.720
Don’t tell me you’re still not awake.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:18.280
I woke up because of your call

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.040
and it’s not like I even had any work scheduled

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.400
can’t you let me sleep in and have a nice dream for once?

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.280
By ‘nice dream,’ you mean…

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.960
you weren’t dreaming about my sister, were you?

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.800
alright, so why did you call?

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.600
I only called to brag a little

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.840
about my company’s car sales to you.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.600
You know, ever since you became a brand ambassador for my company…

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.360
Our sales have shot up.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.280
Everyone at the company is really happy.

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.040
You really live up to the nickname ‘Khun Nu Sun’s Mommy

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.360
and… is P’Flint also happy too?

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.320
Well… ever since I came back after graduating

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.600
she’s seemed kind of tense with me all the time.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.800
don’t overthink it.

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.120
even though I’m her younger sibling, we hardly get to talk

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.640
All she ever thinks about is work.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.840
Maybe it’s because she had to become an executive at such a young age.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.720
Which means she has a lot of responsibilities to deal with.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.080
She’s probably coming in a meeting with the board right now.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.960
It’s about ad promotions and the marketing plan for the second quarter.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.400
I see...

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.200
Alright then, I’ll talk to you later.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.880
I have to head out to meet a client now.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.840
Remember about our plans today.

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:29.560
Yes, see you then.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.520
Then let’s add a promotion for them.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.520
Sure.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520
Alright.

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:54.320
Everyone, get dressed properly and stand in position.

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.159
Everyone!!

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.600
On your feet!

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.280
You! get properly dressed and go stand by. Hurry.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.400
Go stand by.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.080
Good afternoon, Khun Rafah

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.560
Are we all set?

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.200
We’re ready and waiting in the meeting room.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.720
However, Khun Paabfah will not be attending this meeting.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.600
She has a scheduled meeting with executives
from a partner company visiting from Singapore.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.160
When Fay gets back, have her come see me.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.240
It seems that Khun Paabfah has another appointment

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.520
with Khun Atita.

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:40.240
Is there anything in particular?

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.600
It’s not indicated on the schedule.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.560
Shall we start the meeting?

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:08.400
This is the sales report for the first quarter of this year.
It shows an increase of 28.6% compared to last year.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.320
Including pre-orders,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.360
Provided that all of them receive approval,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.880
This would bring our company’s sales to 34% above last year’s figures.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:22.720
It must be said that having Khun Sun Atita as our brand ambassador

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.440
has been a key driving force behind the great success of
the Drive Beyond the SUN campaign.

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.440
Khun Rafah and Khun Paabfah have a truly keen understanding of the market.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.640
So I’d like the marketing team to put together a plan for celebrating the sales results

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.040
to build buzz and attract buyers’ interest.

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.880
We can also use this opportunity to launch a new promotion.

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.200
Uh… but if the number of car pre-orders is higher than this

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.840
There may be potential delivery challenges for certain imported models.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:54.640
As overseas production capacity at the moment
does not seem sufficient to meet market demand.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.160
That won’t be a problem.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.400
I’ve already spoken with our manufacturing partner

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.800
After seeing the first month’s sales performance this quarter,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:09.160
They’ve assured us that the vehicles will be delivered on the original schedule,
counted from the date the customer confirms the purchase.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.920
However,

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.600
Please have the customer service team implement a system to track vehicle status.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:18.080
So that customers can check real-time status updates themselves.

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.800
Sure thing.

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:20.720
Please go ahead.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:27.400
Then, shall we move on to the marketing plan for the third quarter?

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.840
The new sales model

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.240
So, let’s take a look at…

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.480
"Sensationalized news"

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.280
Hello everyone

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.200
Today, it’s just the two of us here on…

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.920
"Sensationalized news"

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.280
Whoa, spill the tea, sis!

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:46.920
Okay, I have to tell you this, Hippo

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:48.560
The latest of the latest, everyone

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.280
An eagle-eyed viewers

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.040
They spotted a famous leading actress,
mention her name and everyone would instantly recognize her.

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.880
- Come on, spill it!
- Photos have surfaced

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:01.720
showing the actress sneaking
into a high-end condo with a mystery man.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.720
- Let’s take a closer look at this first.
- Alright.

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.720
A famous actress.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720
With sweet-eyed look

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.320
a rising star?

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.600
- Here’s a little hint, watch my lips.
- Yes

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.440
This actress

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.160
a shipped couple.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.800
Uh… she does have a shipped partner, you know.

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:17.480
And most importantly… there’s a hashtag status

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:23.520
Netizens with sharp eyes spotted a super-hot rising star
sneaking into a condo, and posting a cryptic status.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:27.880
From a shipped couple to a real one. Oh my!!

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.320
She’s probably coming in a meeting with the board right now.

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.600
It’s about ad promotions and the marketing plan for the second quarter.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.520
Today..

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.640
Will I get to see you?

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.160
Oh, hi there

00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.240
I’m sorry, but Sun is working at the moment.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.800
The person in the photo is definitely not Sun.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:42.000
I’ll get back to you shortly.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.880
Thank you very much.

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.920
Sun, there’s a big problem!

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.320
Come on, P’Bocus, spill the tea! I love those initial-name rumors. love them!

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.120
Any leaked initials yet?

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.640
The initials are out already. It's an S actress! wait, what?!

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.960
But a lot of people are speculating, if I may say this... many are guessing that it’s…

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.160
that it could be the actress Sun Atita — oops! Well, it’s possible, since she’s a rising star

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:11.200
As of now, Sun has not responded to the rumors. So, the two of us, in our capacity as…

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:16.080
How did this news even come out like that?

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.400
I want to be clear. That’s not me in the photo.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.400
I believe that the person in that photo is not you.

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.560
But… if other people think it’s you, I wouldn’t say that’s surprising

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.760
When I first saw the photo…

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:32.880
I actually thought it was you at first, look.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.560
So… in this case

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.400
What are we gonna do?

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.040
The photo is all over the feed.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.240
Plus, on X, the hashtag is trending in the top three.

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.320
That’s not even counting the fake news being spread to stir up the buzz.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.800
I think… if it’s not true…

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.600
You don’t have to worry, Sun. Your fans will come out and defend you.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.960
As for the news, I’ll handle it.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.840
If there are no further issues, I believe the news will die down on its own.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.520
Thank you so much and...

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.000
Sorry for making you get into a trouble.

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.120
Sun. Why are you sorry?

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.800
That's not your fault at all.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.080
Besides, this is also my duty.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.560
P'Mooham...

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:32.240
Yes?

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.160
Today I'm having a plan with Fay

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:39.440
Under these circumstances, is it still okay for me to go?

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.880
Yes sure.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:47.320
As long as you’re not going up to a condo with a guy, you’re good to go.

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.840
Has Khun Rafah been informed about this yet?

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:58.680
Make sure to let Khun Rafah know that it’s not you in the photo.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.520
It could affect the contract.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.400
She's probably

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:09.160
Doesn't have time to pay attention to me though.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.160
We have reviewed the agreement

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.720
and are ready to proceed with the vehicle purchase under the stated terms.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.800
Thank you for the confirmation.

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.640
We’re very glad to hear that you’re ready to proceed with the vehicle purchase.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.880
Our team is fully prepared to support the next steps,

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.400
and we will follow up with your side to reconfirm the delivery schedule,

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:53.200
Furthermore, with regard to the new vehicle model,

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.760
our company would be pleased to move forward with the acquisition.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.440
You granted us exclusive distribution rights for the Thai market

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.360
under the legally binding agreement.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.200
We acknowledge and reaffirm that commitment.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.480
Deal

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.240
we truly appreciate the opportunity to do business with you.

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.120
Good afternoon, Khun Atita. How may I help you?

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.800
Hello, it’s just that I have an appointment with Fay today.

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.680
Has Fay returned to the office yet?

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.400
Khun Pakfah hasn’t returned to the office yet.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.040
However, Khun Pakfah has instructed that if Khun Atita arrives,
she can wait in the reception room first.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.640
Ah.. Yes.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.599
This way right?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.079
Uh..Yes.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.640
Please, this way.

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.200
Please have a seat Khun Atita.

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.040
I’ll go prepare some refreshments for you.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:32.680
Feel free to let me know if there’s anything else I can get for you.

00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.000
Thank you.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.520
My pleasure.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.400
Do you want to take a photo with me?

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.360
Can I?

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.920
You are so kind. Let's take a photo.

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:55.120
Thank you

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.800
About the rumours

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.960
I don't believe it at all. I’m 100% on your side.

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:04.520
Thank you.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.880
Please make yourself comfortable

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.720
All she ever thinks about is work.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.400
Maybe it’s because she had to become an executive at such a young age.

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.640
Which means she has a lot of responsibilities to deal with.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.320
Your smile...

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.640
Since when it went dissappeared?

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.400
Sun

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.400
Why would you tease your friend like that, Fay?

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:18.720
I didn’t think she'd be this easily scared

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.440
- Sorry bud.
- Umm.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:22.720
And whose bouquet is this?

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.080
Or did someone confess their love to you on graduation day?

00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.520
It's mine.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.120
Huh? What about me?

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.000
Don't tell me that you forgot mine.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.520
How could I ever forget?

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.680
I already bought it for you. Didn’t you want a new phone?

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:47.280
Thank you

00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.440
Shall we take a picture?

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.760
P'Flint. Can you take a photo for me and Sun? Here you go.

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.480
Selfie.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:57.560
Selfie.

00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:57.920
Yes.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.440
Come, here.

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.520
Sun, can you come closer?

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.520
Okay okay.

00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:09.120
One Two Selfie!

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.600
Can I see the picture?

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.120
Oh my god. This is so cute.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.120
Alright then, I’ll step out to take some photos first.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:23.520
I'll be back okay?

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:24.640
Okay.

00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:26.360
Let me look at them some more.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.680
Bye Bye.

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.920
Unbelievable.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.120
Fay mentioned that you’re going to study abroad as well, right?

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.640
Yes, I am. I took the exam and was awarded a scholarship

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:45.400
But I’m a little disappointed that I won’t be studying in the same country as Fay.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.600
Then I guess I won’t get to see you for a long time.

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:02.680
Make sure you take good care of yourself, Sun.

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.120
May I ask what time Fay is expected to arrive?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.080
P'Rafah

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:46.040
It feels like we’ve drifted apart since you became famous.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.120
Hello P'Flint.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.400
Will you be using this room, P'Flint?

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.960
I can wait for Fay outside.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.360
There’s something I want to talk to you.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.800
Are you going to talk about the news right?

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.320
So that photo...

00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.640
I don't know

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:21.480
About how you’ve come this far and achieved this level of fame.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:25.120
Whether it was hard or easy for you.

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.960
But if you’re not planning to hold on to it for yourself…

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.280
You should really think about it, Sun.

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.640
About the people who could be affected by your actions.

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.960
I’m well aware of that

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.640
that my actions...

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.360
Whether for better or worse, who it will affect.

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.080
But what I don’t know is…

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:52.880
The way you’re scolding me like this, P'Flint…

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.880
Even though the person in that photo isn’t me.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.080
It’s actually a personal matter.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.800
Who I date or whose condo I go to is my own business.

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.840
As long as it doesn’t become news

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.760
And potentially affect your company.

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.960
As a brand ambassador…

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.760
That being a part of your company’s image is enough.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.680
If that’s what you choose to believe, P'Flint.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.800
Alright then.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.600
From now on, I’ll be more careful so that something like this doesn’t happen again.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.280
If there’s nothing else, I’ll excuse myself now, P'Flint.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:40.080
I was just saying that

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.800
why do you look like you’re about to cry?

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.840
I wouldn’t cry over something like this.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.000
Why?

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:56.440
Or is there something else you want to criticize me about, P'Flint?

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.800
Are you putting on an act?

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.960
You can believe whatever you want.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.080
There’s no point in me saying anything.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:16.920
Let go of me

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.720
Please let me go, P'Flint.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.120
I won't.

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.080
Such a stubborn kid like you...

00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.360
What am I supposed to do with you?

00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.360
Khun Rafah.

00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.760
There's a problem.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.160
- What is going on?
- Ouch

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.200
- He’s coming down.
- Yes right there

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.080
Oh! Guys!

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.200
Nong Nop. May I have a quick interview, please?

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.680
Good afternoon.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.760
Could we have a short interview?

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.880
What are you guys doing here?

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.320
Well well.

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.080
That should have been me who asking that question.

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.840
Since we happen to see you here, may we have a quick interview?

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:30.440
An interview about what?

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.280
About the leaked photos.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.880
Yes, yes. Could you explain a bit more?

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.400
Oh, you’re talking about the leaked photos, right?
The ones with a man and a woman going up to a condo?

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.560
Whoa, that’s pretty direct, isn’t it?

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:44.560
Honestly, the photo isn’t very clear. Why do you assume it’s Sun and me?

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:49.120
At first, I didn’t think so either.
But when I saw you here, it made me consider the possibility.

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:54.720
So, the couple in that photo are that really you guys?
And are you going to go from a rumored couple to a real one?

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.280
- Yes?
- Is that right? / Is that true?

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.080
As for whether we’re dating or not, I think it’s better to talk about that in a joint interview.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.760
Does that mean we can expect an official announcement soon?

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:05.320
Is that correct?

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.800
P'Flint.

00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.080
Oh! there is Sun!.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.400
- Where? Where?
- She's coming

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:32.840
Sun, May I have a quick interview?

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.240
Get it! Take the shot!

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.920
Cancel the appointment.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.120
- She's gone
- Take a picture of Nop instead.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.400
- So what’s the conclusion, Nop?
- What’s really going on?

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.400
- Could you explain?
- Exactly.

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:10.240
(reporters shouting questions)

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:18.160
On behalf of Rafah Import Sawa Co., Ltd.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.840
We would like to inform you that…

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:27.360
The company does not authorize any media outlets to publish or distribute
images or video footage of Khun Rafah and Khun Atita

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.680
that were taken today without prior authorization.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.280
Should any media outlet violate this notice,

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.000
the company will pursue legal action
in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Act.

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.880
We've already taken the footage.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.960
(people talking noisily)

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:20.680
How did you know which floor I live on?

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:26.800
You must have forgotten that your best friend is my younger sister.

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.440
Then you must have forgotten that it’s time to let go of my hand.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.920
Yes. P'Mooham.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.760
I heard from Fay that Nop brought a whole group of reporters to see you
at the company. Is that true?

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:18.280
It was probably just a coincidence. I don’t think he meant to bring the reporters along.

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.800
Um… but I still find it a bit strange

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.360
You were only meeting with Fay, just the two of them.
So how did anyone know that you would be coming to the company?

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.560
Maybe someone at the company posted that they saw me.

00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:32.120
You’re being very optimistic.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:37.080
If people didn’t know any better, they’d think you planned
to make your couple debut announcement at my company.

00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:42.360
Um… who are you with right now?

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.920
with Khun Rafah.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.920
Khun Rafah is probably worried that I might cause more trouble for her company.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.880
So she kindly took the time to drive me back to condo.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:00.480
Alright then. It’s good that you're back at the condo,
so there won’t be any more surprises.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:04.320
I just came out of a meeting.
I’ve only just finished sorting out the leaked photo issue with the network.

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:07.240
If anything else happens, I’m seriously going to be dead.

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:11.240
There’s nothing else. I’ll talk to you later, P’Mooham.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.800
I’m at my place now. I hope you can finally feel at ease, P'Flint.

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.960
that I won’t be a problem for you again.

00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:34.680
Please get home safely. Thank you once again for bringing me home.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.280
Who said that I'm leaving?

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.800
I’ll stay with you until Fay gets here.

00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.840
You wouldn’t mind, would you?

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.920
Either way, I need to talk to you about the news and clear things up today

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.560
before the meeting tomorrow.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.080
Then please, feel free to stay, P'Flint.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.720
I’ll go get some water.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.000
You still remember?

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.720
That I like chamomile tea.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.760
I just only have chamomile tea

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:35.240
If you’ll excuse me, I’ll go upstairs to put my things first.

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.520
Why are you doing this to me?

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:49.080
What's up, Fay?

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:52.520
P'Mooham just called to apologize to Faye about what happened today.

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.520
But both me and P'Mooham are wondering the same thing.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.240
How did other people know that Sun came to see me at the company?

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.640
So I had the security team check the CCTV footage.

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.040
I think she might have a stalker.

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.400
When did you grow up to become this cruel?

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.960
Watch out.

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:27.280
That was close, wasn’t it?

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:30.440
Thank you.

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:36.240
Here.

00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.880
P'Flint.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.400
Oh, you’re still here?

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.760
I was actually going to ask you to study science together.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
You know each other?

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.400
She just helped me a moment ago.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.200
If it weren’t for her, I’d probably be on the floor right now.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.440
Thank you again, P’…

00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:01.120
P'Flint.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:02.280
She's my sister.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.480
This is Sun, my close friend.

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.280
Nice to meet you, Sun.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.680
Diffusion is the movement of substances.

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.560
from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration

00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.280
without using any energy

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:25.040
Simply allowing it to spread naturally.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:31.160
gradually spreading on its own

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:38.240
Is there anything I explained that you didn’t understand?

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.760
No, it's good.

00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:52.440
It’s like when we drop ink into water.

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:57.800
At first, it’s just a small drop in the glass of water.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:00.160
But after a short time,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.760
the ink spreads throughout the water.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.200
without us having to do anything.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.880
That's right.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.680
Well done.

00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:21.000
But I think it’s more like falling in love with someone.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:27.040
You meet them just once,
and before you know it, they’ve spread throughout your whole heart.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:30.000
Are you in love, Fay?

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
I'm going to tell mom.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:35.720
Come on. what part don’t you understand? Let me see.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.960
Wait. I get it now.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.400
Give it to me.

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.120
Here.

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.280
If you’re already sleepy, it’s okay if you want to head back first.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.720
What are you doing, P'Flint?

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.480
Let go of me right now.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.120
Why?

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.280
Are you trying to say you don’t like me doing this?

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:22.520
You shouldn’t treat me like this.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.360
Let go of me.

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:34.240
This doesn’t compare to you going up to a guy’s condo.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:36.920
Do you think I should know what you went up there for?

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.240
Why do I always look like I’m about to cry whenever I’m with you?

00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:52.720
You never seem as happy with me as you are with others.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.600
I’m just sad.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.040
that you don’t believe I’m not the kind of person the news says I am.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.720
It’s like…

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:09.720
You never really knew me.

00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.800
Do you really think I’m that kind of person?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.600
I...

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.320
I'm sorry.

00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.720
But from now on,

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.720
I want you to stay where I can see you… until everything settles down.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.440
Deal?

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:56.960
Yes.

00:39:57.560 --> 00:39:58.800
That photo… it’s actually me.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.640
Dear diary,

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.200
You won’t believe this.

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:59.640
I went over to Fay’s place to study today.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.800
And I even… got to see P'Flint.

00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.560
But I honestly don’t know if studying will help… or if I’m going to fail the exam.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:11.160
Because I couldn’t focus at all.

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.160
The closer I got…

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.800
My heart was pounding so loudly, I was afraid he could hear it.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:18.480
But P'Flint probably doesn’t know.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.760
Why did that jerk give an interview like this?

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:27.000
I don’t even want to think about what P'Flint would say if she found out.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.360
It’s not that hard.

00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.480
We’re just turning a rumor into the truth.

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:31.840
You're just dating me.

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.960
The buzz is good. The channel’s happy.

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:36.200
Good afternoon.

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.960
Good afternoon. Sun. This is P'Peach.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:39.640
I'll be today’s photographer.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.320
I think that Miss Peach is acting kind of strange.

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.560
How strange?

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:45.840
“She just gave my lipstick back and said I’d left it there.”

00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.560
Even though we’d just met for the first time.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.680
Doesn’t that seem weird to you?

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:57.600
I think Sun-Kiss skin look is perfect with just a light touch like this.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.240
Why are you doing this, P'Flint?

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.440
Why are you suddenly so interested in everything about me?

00:42:02.440 --> 00:42:04.800
What do you actually want from me?
