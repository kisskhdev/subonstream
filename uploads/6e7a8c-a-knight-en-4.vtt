WEBVTT

00:01:10.653 --> 00:01:12.113
Leave the food and go.

00:01:25.126 --> 00:01:28.212
My uncle says I must beg your forgiveness
for deceiving you.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.880
Your uncle?

00:01:29.881 --> 00:01:31.340
Prince Baelor.

00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:33.009
The heir to the Iron Throne.

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.972
- I never meant to lie.
- Yeah, but you did.

00:01:38.973 --> 00:01:41.892
About everything, starting with your name.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.727
I've not heard of a Prince Egg.

00:01:43.728 --> 00:01:46.188
- Short for Aegon.
- Of course.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.649
After the Conqueror?

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.401
How many Aegons have been king?

00:01:51.402 --> 00:01:54.197
Four. Four Aegons.

00:01:58.868 --> 00:01:59.869
So why'd you do it?

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:02.705
Was it some jape?

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.959
Make a fool of the stupid hedge knight?

00:02:06.751 --> 00:02:09.628
No. I was supposed to squire for Daeron.

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.047
He's my older brother.

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:13.799
He's a shit knight, and a drunk.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.718
And he didn't want to enter the lists.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:21.515
He only meant for us to hide in that inn
until the tourney was over.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.268
- You shaved your head.
- It was Daeron who shaved it.

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.271
Was it Daeron that told me
you were a stable boy?

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.065
- I didn't--
- What?

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:32.734
I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:34.445
Of course, you did.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:36.865
That's why you lied.

00:02:40.577 --> 00:02:41.995
Dry your eyes.

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:48.584
I was just so disappointed
when I couldn't go to the tourney--

00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:51.546
Oh, we can't have the little prince being
disappointed now, can we?

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:56.633
I just wanted to be
somebody's squire, ser.

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.387
You'd have served a donkey,
were it squire-less.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.557
I'm sorry, ser.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:04.809
Truly am.

00:03:09.564 --> 00:03:11.983
It's just a bit of bad luck
we found each other, isn't it?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.863
What will they do with me, Egg?

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:21.700
My uncle wants to see you
after you're done eating.

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.910
I'm done now, then.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.954
I've already kicked
one prince in the mouth.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.624
Don't mean to keep another one waiting.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:00.657
Rise.

00:04:05.954 --> 00:04:07.038
Pour Ser Duncan a cup, Aegon.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:10.333
Try not to spill it on him.

00:04:13.711 --> 00:04:15.338
The boy won't spill, Your Grace.

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:18.508
He's a good boy.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.011
Good squire. And he meant no harm.

00:04:23.304 --> 00:04:24.888
I know that now.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.933
One need not intend harm to do it.

00:04:28.476 --> 00:04:30.185
Aegon should have come to me when he saw

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:32.020
what his brother was doing
to those puppeteers.

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.856
- There was no time, Uncle, I--
- Instead, he ran to you, Ser Duncan.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:36.192
That was no kindness.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.281
I wish Ser Duncan had killed him.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:43.700
Aerion is your brother.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.328
And the septons say
we must love our brothers.

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:54.210
Aegon, leave us now.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.629
As you will, Your Grace.

00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:09.726
How good a knight are you?

00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:12.645
How skilled at arms?

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:16.858
Sir Arlan taught me
sword and shield and

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:19.402
how to tilt at rings.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.829
My brother Maekar returned to the castle
a few hours ago.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:35.835
He found his son Daeron drunk in an inn
a day's ride to the south.

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:40.130
- I know it.
- He told my brother

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:42.716
that a huge robber knight
made off with Aegon.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:45.344
I fear you have been cast
as this robber knight, ser.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:46.678
He's lying.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:49.514
I left that inn four nights past.

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:52.392
Prince Daeron did not pursue
his brother's captor.

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:53.394
Seemingly not.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:05:59.691
What of the girl?

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:01.485
By the time Aerion is done
twisting the tale,

00:06:01.486 --> 00:06:02.695
it will be high treason.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.822
Treason? By puppetry?

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.783
The dragon is the sigil
of the Royal House.

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:09.034
To portray one being slain...

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.577
It was surely innocent.

00:06:10.578 --> 00:06:13.455
Perhaps, but far from wise,
even in peacetime.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:17.000
Aerion calls it a veiled attack
on House Targaryen,

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.543
an incitement to revolt.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.380
Do you believe that, Your Grace?

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.299
One truth is beyond dispute.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.676
You laid hands upon
the Blood of the Dragon.

00:06:26.677 --> 00:06:29.388
The girl's finger was snapped in half.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:32.516
No matter the cause, it is never wise
to strike a king's grandson.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:34.017
Would you not have done the same?

00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:35.727
I might have.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.022
But I'm a prince of the realm,
not a hedge knight.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:41.275
Don't all knights make the same oath?

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:45.238
To protect the innocent?

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:58.584
Aerion would like your head
for what you did to him.

00:07:01.295 --> 00:07:04.507
He will not have it,
but I cannot deny him a trial.

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.718
And with Daeron's accusation
that you kidnaped Egg,

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:10.971
the court is unlikely
to rule in your favor.

00:07:10.972 --> 00:07:12.556
And when I'm found guilty?

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.474
The last time a man
struck the royal blood,

00:07:14.475 --> 00:07:16.811
it was decreed he should lose
the offending hand.

00:07:17.895 --> 00:07:19.689
And you kicked him, too, did you not?

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:22.525
I did.

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:26.404
You have another choice.

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.865
Whether it is a better one
or a worse, I cannot say.

00:07:29.866 --> 00:07:33.411
And so, I ask you again,
Ser Duncan the Tall,

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:37.248
how good a knight are you, truly?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.821
Trial by combat.

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:12.617
That is my right.

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.165
I refuse.

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:23.084
You cannot refuse.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:26.005
Any knight accused of a crime
has the right to demand as such.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.633
Unless you withdraw your claim?

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:35.431
A trial of seven.

00:08:40.228 --> 00:08:42.103
That is my right, I do believe.

00:08:42.104 --> 00:08:43.523
What the fuck is a trial of seven?

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:51.322
It is another form of trial by combat.

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:56.076
Ancient. Seldom invoked.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:59.372
It came across the Narrow Sea
with the Andals and their seven gods.

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.251
Well, if it was the Andals...

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:06.420
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:09.422
The old man was never much for praying.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:12.635
What is a trial of seven?

00:09:13.719 --> 00:09:16.137
The Andals believed
that if seven champions fought,

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:18.766
the gods, being thus honored,
would be more like to intervene

00:09:20.017 --> 00:09:21.602
and see the guilty party punished.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:30.610
Are you cowering behind some
6,000-year-old Andal foolery

00:09:30.611 --> 00:09:34.239
because you're afraid to face
this hedge knight alone?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.741
- No.
- Then why?

00:09:36.784 --> 00:09:38.786
Why not slay the rogue yourself?

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:43.623
Daeron has been wronged as well.

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:47.460
Ser Duncan must pay
for each one of his crimes against us.

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:51.172
Or would we leave a matter
of Targaryen honor in doubt?

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:53.174
Do not speak to me of honor, boy.

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.176
This is fucking nonsense.

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:56.345
Is it?

00:09:58.014 --> 00:09:59.348
No.

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:09.984
Aerion is within his rights.
We have no choice.

00:10:11.193 --> 00:10:13.862
A trial of seven must be held at dawn.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.032
What does that mean?
That I must fight seven men?

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.658
Do not play the fool.

00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:20.494
It must be seven against seven.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.747
You must find six other knights
to fight beside you.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:25.290
But I have no one else.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:28.544
If a cause is just,
good men will fight for it.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.922
If not, it will be because you are guilty.

00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:44.894
Come here.

00:10:54.403 --> 00:10:55.696
Idiot!

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:01.744
Can I go now?

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:10.336
Seek your champions, Ser Duncan.

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:43.077
Oh, lads.

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:47.164
I've mucked it up this time.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.001
- I think I'm gonna die tomorrow.
- Dunk!

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.338
Is that you? You're alive.

00:12:00.594 --> 00:12:02.470
Raymun, thank you for watching my--

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.806
Are you hungry?

00:12:04.932 --> 00:12:06.600
- No, not really.
- Come on.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:11.104
- Whoa!
- Were you talking to your horses?

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.733
- Yeah.
- That's fucking mad.

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:17.068
Trial of seven.

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:21.114
Duncan, that means battleaxes,
morningstars, and lances of war.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:23.199
- I know what it means.
- I apologize.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:25.368
Seems cousin here has milk in his veins.

00:12:25.369 --> 00:12:28.204
- Oh, fuck off, I just meant--
- This is knightly combat, Raymun.

00:12:28.205 --> 00:12:30.624
As you are no knight,
your skin is not at risk.

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:36.547
I saw what Aerion did to those puppeteers.

00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.592
All knights vow to protect the innocent.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:41.302
Even hedge knights, I assume.

00:12:44.305 --> 00:12:45.598
I'm for you.

00:12:49.268 --> 00:12:50.895
Thank you, ser.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:57.442
- Perhaps you shouldn't.
- It pains me to admit it,

00:12:57.443 --> 00:12:58.943
but Steffon's a fine sword.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.238
- Why would that pain you?
- I don't doubt that.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.532
But the Dragon House will not look kindly
on those who oppose them.

00:13:04.533 --> 00:13:05.868
Dragon House?

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:08.746
Where are their dragons, Ser Duncan?

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:12.081
Us Fossoways, we were here

00:13:12.082 --> 00:13:14.626
long before these others
come to our shores.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.837
And I'll warrant we'll be here
long after they are gone.

00:13:18.547 --> 00:13:21.634
- Who else fights with us?
- I know no one else.

00:13:22.968 --> 00:13:26.055
I'm sure we can find five more good men
who wish singers to make them immortal.

00:13:27.431 --> 00:13:31.227
I do not know why tragedy
so oft follows after honorable men.

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.521
But when I find myself
without the answers,

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.982
the answer is always "more glory."

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:40.944
Lucky for you, I have some friends.

00:13:40.945 --> 00:13:42.987
Ser Lyonel, Lord Lannister, Ser Otho.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:45.114
They won't be happy at being woken.

00:13:45.115 --> 00:13:46.700
Then they'll fight like pestered badgers.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:50.746
You shan't die under my watch, ser.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:52.665
I promise you that.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:20.359
Raymun, do you think your cousin
can bring the men he speaks of?

00:14:21.318 --> 00:14:22.736
I don't know.

00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:26.991
You may be wise to run.

00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:29.409
Won't they kill me if I run?

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:30.953
Won't they kill you anyway?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:37.543
Maybe the gods figure
this is what I deserve.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.254
For doing what you were supposed to do?

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:44.967
For not knowing my place.

00:14:48.053 --> 00:14:50.264
- Ser.
- Egg!

00:14:51.849 --> 00:14:52.850
What are you doing?

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:56.604
I'm your squire, ser.
You'll need someone to arm you.

00:14:58.314 --> 00:15:00.398
Does your father know
you've left the castle?

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.859
I hope not.

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:07.907
I don't think I could bear
another foot whipping tonight.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.411
- You!
- No! No, Duncan, no!

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.496
Stop! Please!

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:16.915
Are you mad coming here?

00:15:16.916 --> 00:15:19.167
I should drive this through your neck.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:20.793
I'd sooner you pour me a cup of wine.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:23.422
Fuck your wine. You lied about me.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:26.341
Well, I had to say something
when my father

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:28.719
demanded to know where Egg had gotten to.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.388
Please, don't hurt him.

00:15:34.767 --> 00:15:36.518
He can't kill me twice.

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:40.146
My father's going to join
the seven accusers, ser.

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:43.274
Yeah, of course he will.
He must redeem his sons' honor.

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.110
Not that I ever asked
to have my honor redeemed.

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:48.196
Whoever has it can keep it,
so far as I'm concerned.

00:15:48.197 --> 00:15:50.532
I begged him not to, ser. I begged him.

00:15:51.659 --> 00:15:54.369
For what it's worth,
you have little to fear from me,

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.579
and I'll do my best to look
gallant in the first charge.

00:15:56.580 --> 00:16:00.458
But after that, perhaps
you could strike me a nice blow

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:02.543
to the side of the helm.

00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:04.295
Make it ring. Not too loud.

00:16:04.296 --> 00:16:06.757
Is that all you came here to say?

00:16:10.302 --> 00:16:12.554
My father has commanded
the Kingsguard to fight as well.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.517
Only the three that are here.

00:16:17.518 --> 00:16:18.936
Who do you have, ser?

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:21.897
Raymun's cousin.

00:16:27.987 --> 00:16:30.781
I can bring people, ser. Knights. I can.

00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:33.658
I'll be fighting against your family.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:36.327
My father will be well guarded,
and you won't kill Daeron.

00:16:36.328 --> 00:16:38.288
He told you he'd fall down.

00:16:42.042 --> 00:16:43.419
And Aerion.

00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:45.963
You'd see him dead?

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:48.631
When I was little,

00:16:48.632 --> 00:16:51.342
Aerion used to come
into my bed chamber at night,

00:16:51.343 --> 00:16:53.469
put his knife in between my legs.

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:55.596
He had too many brothers, he'd say.

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:58.517
Maybe one night, he'd make me his sister.
Then he could marry me.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.355
Sorry, that was...

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.024
Egg has the truth of it.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:07.817
Aerion can be quite the monster.

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:10.028
And he threw my cat in the well, too.

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:12.614
- He says he didn't, but he did.
- Alright.

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:17.035
He thinks he's a dragon in human form.

00:17:17.036 --> 00:17:18.703
That's why he was so wroth
at the puppet show.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:20.747
A pity he wasn't born a Fossoway.

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.042
Then he'd think himself an apple
and we'd all be a deal safer.

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:26.920
I must steal back to the castle.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:29.298
Ser Duncan?

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:31.383
Private word?

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:51.612
I dreamed of you.

00:17:53.113 --> 00:17:54.615
You said that.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.410
- At the inn.
- Did I?

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:03.040
Well, my dreams
are not like yours.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:05.626
Mine come true.

00:18:07.127 --> 00:18:09.921
An impressive talent
for an unimpressive man.

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.632
Another one of life's little ironies.

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:15.636
But I have seen you, ser.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:18.097
And a fire.

00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:20.808
And a dead dragon.

00:18:23.268 --> 00:18:28.190
A great beast with wings so large
they could cover this meadow.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:31.526
It had fallen on top of you.

00:18:31.527 --> 00:18:34.655
But you were alive,
and the dragon was dead.

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:39.243
Did I kill it?

00:18:41.954 --> 00:18:43.872
That I could not say.

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:47.668
We were dragon masters once.

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:51.879
Hard to believe.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.841
Now, they're all gone, but we remain.

00:18:57.469 --> 00:18:58.929
I don't care to die today.

00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:03.350
I don't care to die either.

00:19:07.646 --> 00:19:10.273
It may be that I've killed you
with my lie.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.401
And if so, I'm sorry.

00:19:13.944 --> 00:19:16.613
I'm doomed to some kind of hell, I know.

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:20.242
Likely one without wine.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.758
You are no knight.

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:49.271
You are Florian the Fool.

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:14.796
Ser Duncan.

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:19.051
If you are come for your shield,
she left it with me.

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.695
Where did she go?

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.698
They make for Dorne.

00:20:42.866 --> 00:20:44.493
Well gone is well forgot.

00:20:45.619 --> 00:20:46.662
Good.

00:21:05.389 --> 00:21:06.890
Your rim was old.

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.477
Cheap steel. Brittle and rusted.

00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:13.021
I've made you a new one.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:14.855
It's twice as thick.

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:16.525
I've put some straps on the back.

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:22.114
It will be heavier now, but stronger too.

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:27.911
The girl did the paint.

00:21:30.914 --> 00:21:32.665
The star is fallen.

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:35.961
And the sunset heralds night.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.132
The shield is all painted up
like death.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:44.928
The elm's alive, man.

00:21:46.179 --> 00:21:48.389
See how green the leaves are?

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:49.933
That's summer leaves, for certain.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:53.729
You remember the old shield rhyme?

00:21:57.316 --> 00:21:59.401
Oak and iron, guard me well.

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.030
Or else I'm dead and doomed to hell.

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:06.992
Mm.

00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:20.297
How much do you want
for the new rim and all?

00:22:21.965 --> 00:22:23.216
From you...

00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:26.970
a copper.

00:23:04.424 --> 00:23:05.425
Sers...

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.511
I am in your debt.

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:10.764
The debt is Aerion's.

00:23:11.765 --> 00:23:13.141
And we mean to collect it.

00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.936
- I had heard your leg was broken.
- You heard true.

00:23:16.937 --> 00:23:18.855
My leg is broken, I cannot walk.

00:23:19.815 --> 00:23:23.151
But so long as I can sit
on a horse, I can fight.

00:23:23.568 --> 00:23:25.987
Ser Robyn would die
the king's faithful servant.

00:23:26.655 --> 00:23:30.534
But when the crown goes against the gods,
Ser Robyn goes against the crown.

00:23:32.077 --> 00:23:33.745
I always knew you meant trouble.

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:38.082
- I cannot thank you enough.
- Ah.

00:23:38.083 --> 00:23:40.209
Nor Ser Steffon for bringing you.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.962
Who the fuck is Ser Stevron? Your...

00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:44.880
...boy found me.

00:23:44.881 --> 00:23:47.091
Hasn't been a trial of seven
for a hundred years.

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:49.635
I wasn't about to miss a chance
to bloody up the Kingsguard

00:23:49.636 --> 00:23:51.430
in their pretty white gowns.

00:24:46.985 --> 00:24:49.904
Six. There are only six.

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:51.864
Is it possible Aerion
has not found a seventh

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:53.240
to take up his claim?

00:24:53.241 --> 00:24:55.242
Raymun!

00:24:55.243 --> 00:24:56.536
My helm, if you please.

00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:00.499
Ser Steffon, what of your friends?

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.209
We only need one more to make our seven.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.920
I'm afraid you'll need two more.

00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:11.426
I fight with Prince Aerion
and the accusers.

00:25:17.557 --> 00:25:18.725
No, you...

00:25:19.851 --> 00:25:21.352
you told Ser Duncan to rely on you.

00:25:21.353 --> 00:25:24.230
Well, our prince would not have
made me a lord elsewise,

00:25:24.231 --> 00:25:25.815
but for it thwarted Ser Duncan.

00:25:29.069 --> 00:25:31.112
You traded your honor for a lordship?

00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:33.572
Cousin.

00:25:33.573 --> 00:25:36.367
I know great men who have traded
their honor for far less.

00:25:36.368 --> 00:25:38.453
It was a bargain well struck.

00:25:40.497 --> 00:25:41.915
Fetch me my horse.

00:25:45.418 --> 00:25:46.878
Get him yourself.

00:26:08.108 --> 00:26:09.734
We are lost.

00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:18.201
Knight me. I will take my cousin's place.

00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:24.666
Ser Duncan, knight me.

00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:27.626
Raymun, I shouldn't.

00:26:27.627 --> 00:26:28.878
Without me, you're only five.

00:26:29.921 --> 00:26:31.798
You cannot win with five.

00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:36.428
The lad has the truth of it, I'm afraid.

00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:40.014
Go on, Ser Duncan.

00:26:40.015 --> 00:26:41.516
Any knight can make a knight.

00:26:56.406 --> 00:26:57.990
Go.

00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.826
I shall give Squire Raymun his knighthood.

00:27:11.087 --> 00:27:14.883
In the name of the Warrior,
I charge you to be brave.

00:27:22.265 --> 00:27:26.019
In the name of the Father,
I charge you to be just.

00:27:32.067 --> 00:27:34.027
In the name of the Mother...

00:27:35.028 --> 00:27:37.697
I charge you to protect
the young and innocent.

00:27:50.627 --> 00:27:51.711
Ser Duncan.

00:27:53.046 --> 00:27:54.381
We cannot delay any further.

00:27:55.048 --> 00:27:57.758
- Seems you only have five champions.
- Six.

00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.094
Ser Lyonel is knighting Raymun Fossoway.

00:28:00.095 --> 00:28:01.720
We will fight you six against seven.

00:28:01.721 --> 00:28:03.597
I'm afraid it is not permitted.

00:28:03.598 --> 00:28:05.891
If you cannot find another
knight to join you, ser,

00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:08.019
then you must be declared
guilty of your crimes.

00:28:11.898 --> 00:28:13.775
M'lord, I beg a moment, please.

00:28:15.193 --> 00:28:16.611
You have it.

00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:48.727
M'lords!

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:54.023
I know none of you remember
Ser Arlan of Pennytree.

00:28:56.526 --> 00:28:57.986
But I was his squire.

00:29:00.321 --> 00:29:01.823
We served many of you.

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.119
Ate at your tables.

00:29:07.245 --> 00:29:08.538
Slept in your halls.

00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:15.920
He was a good man.

00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:20.592
And he taught me how to be a knight.

00:29:24.429 --> 00:29:27.015
Not just sword and lance, but honor.

00:29:31.144 --> 00:29:33.146
A knight defends the innocent.

00:29:34.522 --> 00:29:36.983
That's-- that's all I did.

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:46.034
I was not Ser Arlan's blood,
but I have followed his example.

00:29:47.577 --> 00:29:50.038
As your sons will follow yours.

00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:04.511
Who will stand and fight with me?

00:30:21.444 --> 00:30:22.779
The Brute of Bracken!

00:30:53.726 --> 00:30:58.398
Has courage deserted
the noble houses of Westeros?

00:30:59.357 --> 00:31:01.401
I will not believe it is so!

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:09.242
Are there no true knights among you?!

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:35.518
I will take Ser Duncan's side.

00:31:49.115 --> 00:31:50.950
Have you taken leave of your senses?

00:31:52.118 --> 00:31:53.535
This man attacked my son.

00:31:53.536 --> 00:31:55.371
This man protected the innocent.

00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:58.333
As every true knight must.

00:31:59.250 --> 00:32:01.877
Let the gods decide
if he was right or wrong.

00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:02.879
Hyah!
