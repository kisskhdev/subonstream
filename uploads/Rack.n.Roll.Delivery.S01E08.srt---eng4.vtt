WEBVTT

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.240
Loser

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.240
Are you ready to lose to me again?

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.359
Your nose is hurt that bad,

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:59.359
but it still won't shut your mouth.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.320
So what?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.239
As long as that face is there,

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:07.760
how can you compete with me?

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.959
You're just a loser trapped by a woman's face

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.760
inside your inner demons.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.560
You'd better worry about yourself.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:16.640
Still pretending?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.040
When you're defeated at my feet again,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.959
let's see how you pretend then.

00:01:25.519 --> 00:01:26.200
Let's begin.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.599
Who should I bet on this round?

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.560
After all, I lost quite a bit last round.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.879
Give me a break.

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:40.079
With your wealth,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.840
this amount of money

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:42.799
is peanuts!

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.959
But I can't

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:46.120
keep losing all the time.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:47.879
This round,

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.319
I think Lang Jiu

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.519
has a better chance.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.599
I'm betting on Lang Jiu too.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.799
Snooker is all about

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.159
betting on psychological tactics.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.439
Look at the last frame.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.640
Hei Ba played terribly.

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.560
He didn't look like a pro at all.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.120
I actually think

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.519
Hei Ba has a better chance this frame.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.239
A player of his level,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.959
although he might make mistakes occasionally,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.240
surely won't

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.280
keep making mistakes forever.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.560
Besides,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.960
look at the odds.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:20.960
Betting on Hei Ba to win now

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.280
earns you more.

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.639
Come on, come on.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.599
Come on, come on.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.919
Amazing.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.919
I knew it had to be Hei Ba.

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:44.520
Now as long as Hei Ba

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.479
keeps potting the black ball,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.439
he's likely to get a maximum break.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.039
What?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.719
This...

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.400
Is there something wrong with his brain?

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:04.560
What is he doing?

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.360
Is he showing off?

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.479
But doing this,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.080
he can only play defense next.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.240
A perfectly good shot,

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.280
and he wasted it.

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:24.439
Playing mysterious, huh?

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:27.960
Watch how I make you accept your defeat.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.199
Hei Ba,

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:22.319
what on earth is he thinking?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.600
Such a good opportunity,

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.279
and he only plays defense.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:26.920
I think he

00:04:27.079 --> 00:04:28.000
is just pretending.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.560
Just watch.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:31.839
The more he pretends now,

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:33.079
in a moment,

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.879
the harder he'll lose.

00:04:36.079 --> 00:04:36.879
I bet he loses.

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:40.399
I bet he wins.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.759
Frame six ends.

00:04:55.079 --> 00:04:55.600
Lang Jiu wins.

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:57.040
Total score is three to three.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.800
The match enters the seventh frame.

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:39.759
Foul.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:42.279
I fouled.

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.920
I get a penalty.

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:44.759
Penalty points.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.120
This ball,

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.120
consider it a gift.

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:53.199
You can't win anyway.

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.639
Although Lang Jiu made a mistake,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.199
but if Hei Ba wants to win,

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.839
he must pot the remaining two balls

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:01.680
to do it.

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.319
Brilliant!

00:06:45.959 --> 00:06:46.720
Look at him,

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.079
is he really that weak?

00:06:48.399 --> 00:06:49.040
Exactly.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.800
Why did he suddenly get so weak?

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:11.839
Loser.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.759
This is your chance.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.639
If you can't even pot this one,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.800
you might as well just give up.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:22.639
What's going on?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.639
Is the final black ball that hard to hit?

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.720
What did these two do last night?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.279
One is weaker than the other.

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:05.879
Time foul

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:06.800
Turn passes

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:16.879
Do you want it?

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:18.480
I'll give you another chance

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.240
Stop messing around, finish the match quickly

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:29.160
I'm getting tired anyway

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:30.519
I don't want to play with you anymore

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:33.240
As for the truth about what happened back then

00:08:34.279 --> 00:08:36.120
You'd better go down and ask your wife yourself

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:50.639
Frame Twelve

00:08:50.759 --> 00:08:51.600
Lang Jiu wins

00:08:51.799 --> 00:08:52.960
The match enters the Deciding frame

00:09:15.279 --> 00:09:16.120
Look at the layout

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.480
It looks like Lang Jiu can run the table

00:09:18.879 --> 00:09:19.360
Yeah

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:33.559
Only two balls left

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:34.759
If he pots these two balls

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.279
It'll be a maximum break

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:50.360
This...

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.360
This Lang Jiu is really ruthless

00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.919
He clearly could have run the table

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.840
But he insisted on giving it to Hei Ba

00:10:02.159 --> 00:10:03.240
Letting him take a shot

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.879
What a disgrace

00:10:05.519 --> 00:10:06.600
I bet eight figures on you

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.840
To think the former champion

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.080
Was held to zero points

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:13.759
Hei Ba

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.039
Don't say I didn't give you a chance

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.759
I'll give you two balls

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:18.919
Otherwise

00:10:19.399 --> 00:10:20.360
Going out with zero points

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.639
Would look too ugly on you

00:10:21.799 --> 00:10:23.240
The match isn't over yet

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.639
Stubborn to the end

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.320
At a time like this

00:10:28.759 --> 00:10:29.759
You're still pretending

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.279
Stop stalling

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.879
Just shoot

00:10:48.639 --> 00:10:49.879
I'm going to win anyway

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.039
Of course

00:10:51.759 --> 00:10:53.279
If you can't pot it

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:54.600
I can take over

00:11:00.039 --> 00:11:00.679
You can win

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:02.720
Even without potting

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:05.360
Master

00:11:06.159 --> 00:11:07.039
It's completely blocked

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:08.559
Can he break it?

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.279
Theoretically, yes

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.080
But

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.440
That's right

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.799
Precisely because it's theoretically possible

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.919
It makes the opponent keep trying to solve it

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:21.440
Especially when victory is imminent

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:22.559
Little do they know

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.360
This will actually mess up their rhythm

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.879
Causing them to make constant mistakes

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.480
Celestial Palace Six Forms: The Spinblast Killshot

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:31.120
Through rotational collision

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.360
Swapping the cue ball and colored ball

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:34.879
Giving the opponent a theoretically

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.759
Solvable snooker

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:38.840
Making the opponent constantly foul and lose points

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:12.279
Look

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:16.440
He can play like that?

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:18.679
He's absolutely a natural genius

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:20.559
To play like this at a time like this

00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:36.080
You...

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.320
Hei Ba was in a losing position

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:42.960
Yet

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.159
He's still laying snookers

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.639
What is Lang Jiu thinking?

00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.960
It's just an ordinary snooker

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.080
Quick, look

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.759
I can definitely hit it

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:05.480
I take back what I just said

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:06.440
This shot by Hei Ba

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.279
Blocked all potting routes

00:13:15.559 --> 00:13:15.960
Foul

00:13:18.919 --> 00:13:19.799
Replace

00:13:30.879 --> 00:13:31.519
Foul

00:13:35.039 --> 00:13:36.240
Replace

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.279
Foul

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.879
Replace

00:13:51.919 --> 00:13:52.360
Foul

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:53.759
Foul

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:54.840
Foul

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.080
Replace

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:56.639
Foul

00:13:57.879 --> 00:13:58.320
Foul

00:13:58.480 --> 00:13:59.240
Replace

00:14:05.039 --> 00:14:05.559
Foul

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:06.600
Foul

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.559
Impossible

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:09.279
Foul

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:15.639
What are you doing?

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.159
According to the rules

00:14:17.679 --> 00:14:18.960
Multiple consecutive failed escapes

00:14:19.399 --> 00:14:20.039
This match

00:14:20.159 --> 00:14:20.600
You lose
