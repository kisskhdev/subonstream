00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:34.119
Gui Fang

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.960
What's wrong?

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:43.840
I'm sorry.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.479
For making you face so much criticism.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.719
In the end, it's all because of me.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.359
Why are you apologizing?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.520
This isn't your fault.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.799
The ones who should apologize are those people online.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.479
Right, they should apologize.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.840
I've thought about it.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.320
This whole thing started because of me.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:59.479
I have to help resolve it.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.119
I know what kind of people you and Xiaocan are.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.039
Better than anyone.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.159
Don't worry, I'll definitely clear things up for you.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.120
These are the Weibo posts they wrote.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:08.760
I plan to clap back at every single one.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.480
Take a look.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.760
Are my comebacks okay?

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.079
If the comebacks are fine,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.319
I'll post them on Weibo right away.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.000
She's just a young-looking mom

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.239
with a good relationship with her son.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.640
How can these people have such dirty minds?

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:28.680
Good comebacks.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.760
If you really want to help,

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.319
let's print out all the screenshots.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.719
And slap them right in their faces.

00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:43.079
Look at this bunch of people.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.560
They all look like decent human beings,

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.439
but how can they do such dog-like things?

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:49.200
That's not right.

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.319
You're insulting dogs.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.680
If we want to capture all the malicious screenshots,

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:55.480
it'll take a lot of time and energy.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.000
We need to make a plan before acting.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.359
My dear Sister Rui,

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.680
what kind of plan do we need for this?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.920
We just snap-snap screenshots,

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.640
rush into the police station,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.959
and report the case immediately.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.120
Just arrest them.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.120
Just arrest them.

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.759
Nowadays, the burden of proof is on the claimant.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Whether reporting to the police,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.080
or suing,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.319
we still have to collect evidence.

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.560
And filter the information.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.120
Everyone,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.800
everyone.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.639
Look here.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.400
We have a new helper.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.560
He's the main culprit.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.199
If Wei Mingtian wasn't so famous,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.960
there wouldn't be such a huge impact.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.759
Right, blame him.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.879
For things to escalate to this point,

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.120
you have to take full responsibility.

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.560
Come, come, take a look.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.039
How many of your fans are on here?

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.280
Look at what they're saying.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.639
And another thing.

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.159
Seeing you hang around my Godmother every day...

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:46.759
...just makes me angry.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.759
How do you have the nerve to come here?

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.840
You're getting a bit personal there.

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:53.120
It is a bit obvious.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.800
Is it that obvious?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.800
Everything has two sides.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.599
Maybe Wei Mingtian coming here...

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:05.240
...can actually help us out a lot.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:09.560
Can you post a clarification statement on Weibo?

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.639
Yes.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.560
I can post it.

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.400
Don't be mad, Brother Maizi.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:20.159
Me, mad?

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:21.960
What right do I have to be mad?

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:23.840
I... How many times have I said it?

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.800
How many times did I tell you not to post a statement?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800
Do not post a statement.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.840
But you, just as I got you off the trending topics...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.840
...you spoke up.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.280
Seriously.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.840
I... I have no right to be mad.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.240
I'm just a lowly agent.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.240
You're the hot superstar.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.319
Do you know?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.759
Just this behavior of yours...

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.199
...how much trouble it brings to the company?

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.319
Do you know that because of this one Weibo post...

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:43.400
...how much overtime we all have to work?

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.080
Is there anyone else in our company?

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.400
Just me, just me, just me.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.599
Do you know how much overtime I have to work?

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.039
But rumors need to be clarified.

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:52.319
I think the statement is pretty good.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.439
Pretty good.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:54.560
Pretty good.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.759
For the next couple of days...

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.360
...that account of yours...

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:00.400
...don't log into it.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.599
I'll manage it.

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:03.680
I'm so pissed off.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:13.280
My account has been sacrificed.

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:14.400
A glorious death.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.439
Your sacrifice is valuable.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.759
What are you doing?

00:04:21.399 --> 00:04:21.800
Hurry up.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.639
Coming.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.439
Didn't go to class with Mom?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.600
We'll study together tonight.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600
Isn't that too tiring?

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.319
I'm recording this.

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:34.800
Keep talking.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.600
Go on, go on, go on.

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:36.759
You have the right to remain silent.

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:37.600
But every word you say now...

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.480
...will be used as evidence in court.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:02.519
Sorry, buddy.

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.680
I, Li Wai, am a terrible person.

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:07.079
What I did to Godmother...

00:05:07.079 --> 00:05:07.519
Don't mention it.

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.600
You're not allowed to laugh.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.839
Don't laugh.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.360
Reposted and called her an "old hag."

00:05:43.519 --> 00:05:44.399
Think that's okay?

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:46.279
Even one sentence isn't okay. Screenshot it.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.720
What about ones that don't name names...

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:50.560
...but are sarcastic? Can we sue if we screenshot them?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.360
Screenshot it.

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.079
Then categorize them by severity.

00:05:55.079 --> 00:05:56.639
Check if the reposts exceed five hundred.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.680
Over five hundred counts as defamation.

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:00.240
The more reposts, the greater the liability.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.759
Right.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:03.240
We can sue for anything insulting.

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:05.000
Although the specific sentencing...

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.240
...depends on legal regulations.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.759
But these people must be punished severely.

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.959
What we need to do...

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.360
...is find them all.

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:12.079
Right.

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:14.879
Xu Rui's method really works.

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:16.360
As soon as I said I was recording...

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.759
...no one dared to speak.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.519
I finally got some peace and quiet.

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:21.800
Auntie.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.959
My uncle asked a lawyer about it.

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.959
He's handled this kind of case before.

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:27.680
He has experience.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.160
Take a look at this case first.

00:06:30.079 --> 00:06:32.120
Let's make an appointment to see him in a couple of days.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.360
This...

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.879
How could this...

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.759
Thank you all so much.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.920
Thanks to you guys.

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.360
It's all my fault.

00:06:58.079 --> 00:06:59.639
I've taken up so much of your time.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.480
How can you blame yourself?

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.680
Blame those lowlifes for talking trash.

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:05.680
Those lowlifes...

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.959
They're so two-faced.

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.360
Each one curses filthier than the last.

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:09.399
Click on their homepage,

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:10.720
and it's all "peace and love".

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.920
They turn others' lives into a mess,

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.079
but want to live the good life themselves.

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:15.160
Dream on.

00:07:16.079 --> 00:07:17.160
That's the internet world for you.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.759
Everyone thinks

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:19.560
it's safe to hide behind anonymous accounts.

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:21.720
They dare to say any vicious thing.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.480
What kind of people are they?

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:27.800
Why do you look even angrier than me?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.120
Screenshot it.

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:31.240
Auntie.

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:34.879
You, as the person involved, have to do the sorting.

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:37.480
The ones you think aren't that serious,

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.319
drag them into this folder.

00:07:39.639 --> 00:07:40.319
These people,

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.079
we can file a civil lawsuit in court.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.399
Demanding compensation and an apology.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:47.399
The ones you think are more serious,

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.480
drag them into this folder.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.120
These people,

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.439
besides having to respond in court,

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:54.600
we also have to call the police.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.040
Stop.

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:59.000
Is there a problem, Auntie?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.639
Yes.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.480
Can you stop calling me Auntie?

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.399
It sounds really awkward to me.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:07.480
I just keep feeling like

00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.160
I'm taking advantage of you.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.560
Gui Fang rolls off the tongue better.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.879
Exactly, I was suffocating.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.439
My god.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.040
Fang.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:18.360
Gui Fang.

00:08:18.639 --> 00:08:19.639
Fang Fang.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:22.519
Gui Fang.

00:08:24.639 --> 00:08:25.879
Isn't this much better?

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.040
Everyone's happy.

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:28.600
Come on, let's do this.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:29.000
Let's do this.

00:08:29.079 --> 00:08:29.399
Let's do this.

00:08:30.279 --> 00:08:31.040
Go, go!

00:08:31.399 --> 00:08:32.000
Just get it done.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.960
It's so late.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:48.000
Hurry, stop working, let's go eat.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.200
Forget it, instant noodles are fine.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.600
One Braised Beef, thanks.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.320
Plus one.

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:52.960
Plus two.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.200
Stop adding!

00:08:57.399 --> 00:08:58.840
Nothing should get in the way of a meal.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.120
Let's go, hurry back.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.240
Mom will cook for you.

00:09:06.639 --> 00:09:07.039
Let's go.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:10.279
Mom is cooking!

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.879
Going home!

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.279
Xiaocan, look what they're saying.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.080
Help me, quick, help me think of a comeback.

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:20.600
It's so awful.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:21.720
Come in.

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:22.679
We're home!

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:23.919
Quick, change your shoes.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:25.759
Li Wai is here too.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.799
Just put it here.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.759
Say hello.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.919
How come you guys are here?

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:30.840
Hello.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.279
Wait.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.679
Xu Rui, why are you here too?

00:09:32.879 --> 00:09:34.320
Xu Rui, why didn't you tell me you were coming?

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:35.840
I want to wear this pair.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.000
We bought ingredients.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.399
We're all having hot pot together.

00:09:39.399 --> 00:09:39.759
Wait.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.360
What time is it? You're eating now?

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:45.080
We were all busy working together just now.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.039
Didn't have time to eat.

00:09:46.039 --> 00:09:47.960
So we bought ingredients to cook something together.

00:09:49.039 --> 00:09:49.600
Guests are here.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.320
You entertain them first, I'll just...

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:50.720
Li Wai.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.639
Hurry and entertain them.

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:53.919
Okay, okay, okay.

00:09:53.919 --> 00:09:55.120
Kong Xiaocan, come help me with the ingredients.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.759
One-eighty.

00:09:55.919 --> 00:09:56.320
Hurry up.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:57.720
Where is there 180?

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.960
Let me set up the table first.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:00.559
So cute.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:01.559
Cute, cute.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.519
This looks so much like Fang.

00:10:03.679 --> 00:10:04.399
This doesn't look like her.

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:06.360
How did his eyes get smaller as he grew up?

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:07.799
Didn't he have double eyelids when he was little?

00:10:08.039 --> 00:10:09.600
This also looks like Fang. This looks like Fang.

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.879
Her balcony is like a little vegetable garden.

00:10:11.879 --> 00:10:13.519
Oh my god.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.559
My god.

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.799
What is this?

00:10:16.039 --> 00:10:16.679
This is green onion, right?

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:17.279
Green onion.

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:18.399
Scallions.

00:10:18.399 --> 00:10:19.480
Celery.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.639
Fang really...

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.080
Does she really need to buy groceries?

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.879
She's so clingy with her son, it's definitely unhealthy.

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:38.240
In the future, what good girl

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.559
would want to be with her son?

00:10:40.159 --> 00:10:42.120
If my mom clung to me like that, I couldn't stand it.

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:48.759
Xiaocan.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.519
Do you think...

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.080
...that Mom is too clingy with you now?

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.519
You've got that backwards, right?

00:10:58.879 --> 00:10:59.879
Who's clinging to whom here?

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:00.960
I'm the one clinging to you.

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:03.120
Do you think I'm too clingy with you?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.919
Are you teasing me?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.240
I've realized that now...

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.919
...you've really grown up.

00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:16.519
I... I'd rather hear that I've grown taller.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.000
Smells so good, so good.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:19.960
It really smells amazing.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.960
This slice of luncheon meat is mine. I'm starving.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.639
I reserved it. It has my name on it, nobody take it.

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:23.440
I'm starving to death.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:27.919
It's not cooked yet. Wait for the pot to boil.

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:29.120
Darn it, darn it.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.000
Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip.

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.039
What do you want to eat?

00:11:32.519 --> 00:11:33.240
I want to eat tripe.

00:11:33.639 --> 00:11:34.200
If you ask me...

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.240
...you guys are so efficient.

00:11:36.639 --> 00:11:37.360
Does that mean tomorrow...

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.919
...we can hand the evidence over to the police?

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.840
Not just the police side.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.759
We need to file a report.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.879
There are many other steps to take too.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:46.399
First, we go to the local notary office.

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.320
To get all these posts notarized.

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:50.159
You have to go there in person.

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:52.759
Then go to the court to file a lawsuit.

00:11:52.919 --> 00:11:55.720
Requesting the real information of the infringer.

00:11:55.879 --> 00:11:56.919
If they provide it...

00:11:57.159 --> 00:11:58.200
...we'll settle before the trial.

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.919
Then sue those who posted.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:02.720
These parts can be handled by a lawyer.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:04.200
So...

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.879
Is the legal fee expensive?

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.360
You don't need to worry about that.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:10.960
You can demand that those who hurt you...

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.000
...cover your legal fees.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:13.960
It costs money to notarize the posts.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:14.840
You need to keep the invoices.

00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:17.639
And any costs incurred during the lawsuit...

00:12:17.639 --> 00:12:18.440
...keep the invoices for all of them.

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:20.600
We'll make those bad guys reimburse you later.

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:21.639
Okay.

00:12:22.559 --> 00:12:23.000
Sister Rui.

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:24.360
You are so amazing.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.320
Did you secretly study law or something?

00:12:26.799 --> 00:12:27.200
Thank you for your hard work.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.799
Just eat.

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.879
Here, Sister Rui, I'll eat more on your behalf.

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:32.159
You need to keep a clear head at all times.

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.200
I think I just scrolled past Wei Mingtian.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.879
It looks like he's clarifying things for Gui Fang.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:43.759
I just want to say...

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.559
...what's being said online isn't true.

00:12:45.559 --> 00:12:47.120
Gui Fang is really a wonderful person.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:48.039
I was the one who dragged her into this.

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:48.679
I hope you all...

00:12:48.679 --> 00:12:49.559
Stop pulling my hair.

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.240
How many times have I told you?

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:53.720
I told you not to get involved, not to get involved!

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.159
You just had to stir up trouble for yourself, didn't you?

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:56.840
Do you know what's most important right now?

00:12:56.919 --> 00:12:57.720
It's the truth.

00:12:58.919 --> 00:12:59.399
The truth?

00:12:59.519 --> 00:13:00.519
Does the truth pay your rent?

00:13:00.759 --> 00:13:01.960
Does the truth send you to college?

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.120
Does the truth pay your tuition?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.360
Do you really think those people...

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.480
...care what the truth is?

00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:06.279
Let me tell you.

00:13:06.399 --> 00:13:07.440
The truth right now is...

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:09.120
...that you rely on the company for everything.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.919
You rely on me.

00:13:10.159 --> 00:13:10.840
I am the company.

00:13:10.919 --> 00:13:11.679
Then I quit.

00:13:12.039 --> 00:13:13.320
Anyway, I won't be an accomplice to this.

00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:14.200
I quit.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.360
Fine.

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.000
You've seen the contract.

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:18.279
You know how much the penalty is.

00:13:18.399 --> 00:13:19.200
You pay the compensation to them.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:19.960
I'm done earning this money.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:20.720
Get out.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.600
Look at you acting all tough.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:24.960
Starting a rebellion?

00:13:25.639 --> 00:13:26.559
I'm telling you, for the next two days...

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:28.159
...don't go to school.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:30.399
As for work...

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.200
...I'll pick you up and drop you off.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.639
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.200
I'll ask for leave from the school.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:41.960
Ms. Kong,

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.440
the platform has already provided us with

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.960
the real information of the anonymous accounts.

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:47.080
Based on the list we've compiled so far,

00:13:47.559 --> 00:13:48.480
the ones with the most serious impact

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.039
are the operator of this account,

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:50.960
named Zhao Chuyi,

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:53.279
and the rumor mongers who posted the most initially,

00:13:53.679 --> 00:13:55.120
as well as a few leading accounts.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:57.799
Ms. Kong, let me confirm with you again.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:59.159
Regarding your request,

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:00.840
do you wish to sue everyone?

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:02.360
Or just sue these few?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.200
My child has already taken me to report it to the police.

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.799
Can I still sue everyone?

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.639
Hold on.

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:27.240
It's like this.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:34.320
Of course you can.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.279
The police handle the public security punishment.

00:14:36.279 --> 00:14:36.559
Right.

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:38.279
The court handles civil compensation.

00:14:38.279 --> 00:14:38.799
Yes.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:41.039
It's just that the waiting time might be longer.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:41.480
Right.

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.120
So, do you...

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:44.720
want everyone to bear your costs

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.600
and demand compensation?

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:47.840
Or mainly demand it from these few people?

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.759
If you demand everyone to bear it,

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:51.519
it's too scattered.

00:14:51.639 --> 00:14:52.440
And hard to enforce.

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:54.360
Then let's just go with these few people.

00:14:54.639 --> 00:14:56.159
All costs will be borne by them.

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.320
Is it okay if the others just apologize?

00:14:59.320 --> 00:14:59.799
Hold on.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.759
I'm not very close with her either.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:12.159
Let me summarize.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.360
All posters

00:15:13.519 --> 00:15:15.279
need to delete the defamatory posts

00:15:15.279 --> 00:15:16.919
and publicly apologize to Ms. Kong.

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:17.240
Right.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:18.240
These few people

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:21.200
need to bear your litigation fees, legal fees,

00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.919
notarization fees, and emotional distress damages.

00:15:22.919 --> 00:15:23.519
Yes. Is that okay?

00:15:23.799 --> 00:15:24.240
Is that okay?

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.960
Will this punishment go into their permanent records?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.559
This...

00:15:34.799 --> 00:15:36.960
might depend on how the school handles it.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:38.000
Also,

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.919
I still suggest you contact

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:40.879
the other involved party,

00:15:40.879 --> 00:15:41.679
Mr. Wei Mingtian.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.679
If you can act as co-plaintiffs

00:15:43.679 --> 00:15:44.440
and sue together,

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.759
it will definitely further expand the impact.

00:15:46.879 --> 00:15:47.200
Yes.

00:15:48.759 --> 00:15:49.679
Let's not do that.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.279
Don't drag him into this anymore.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.639
Otherwise, it'll just get more confusing.

00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.919
Actually, I tried contacting him.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:57.080
But his phone either goes unanswered

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.120
or is just turned off.

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.679
I don't know what's going on.

00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.279
Thank you, thank you.

00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:07.000
You're welcome.

00:16:07.279 --> 00:16:08.240
I didn't really help much.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.480
Just used a bit of data.

00:16:45.639 --> 00:16:46.120
Where are you going?

00:16:49.799 --> 00:16:50.480
Brother Maizi.

00:16:51.759 --> 00:16:53.840
I have a teacher who is very strict.

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:56.360
Three leaves count as one absence.

00:16:56.679 --> 00:16:58.039
I really have to go to class today.

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:01.080
Isn't this a special situation?

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.799
The teacher will surely understand.

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:05.480
For the next couple of days,

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.680
stop thinking about classes.

00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:08.359
In about half an hour,

00:17:08.559 --> 00:17:09.759
go put on a face mask.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.480
Your skin isn't looking too good.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.799
Focus your mind on work, right?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:15.039
Yes.

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:17.799
Brother Maizi.

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.799
I think you're absolutely right.

00:17:22.599 --> 00:17:24.160
Lately, I...

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.880
I'll just focus wholeheartedly on work.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.680
I won't go to school for now.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:30.440
Why are you pushing me?

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.200
I want to sit right here.

00:17:31.839 --> 00:17:32.759
And why are you shouting?

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.440
I...

00:17:35.319 --> 00:17:35.799
It's just...

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.279
My dialogue teacher said...

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:39.279
that even in daily life,

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.319
we should keep practicing our lines.

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.880
That way, when we get on stage,

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.519
interacting with the partner will be more natural.

00:17:45.799 --> 00:17:46.519
You should have told me sooner.

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:48.000
I could've just been your partner.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.839
Let's practice, let's practice, let's practice.

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:56.039
It's good that you figured it out.

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:57.079
Tell me,

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:59.319
isn't going to school just for getting a good job?

00:17:59.599 --> 00:18:02.279
And now you already have a good job.

00:18:02.279 --> 00:18:04.079
So why bother going to school?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:04.640
Right?

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.160
Yeah.

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:09.440
Don't worry, I'll work hard.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:11.319
I'm not going anywhere.

00:18:12.039 --> 00:18:13.759
That's not necessary either.

00:18:14.279 --> 00:18:14.880
Recently,

00:18:15.319 --> 00:18:16.440
I was thinking about

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.160
booking you for a couple of variety shows.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.279
Let's keep the hype up.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:21.880
No need.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.559
I appreciate your kindness.

00:18:24.839 --> 00:18:26.079
Appreciate what?

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.519
This is your job.

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:29.000
I just feel that...

00:18:29.279 --> 00:18:31.839
too much exposure recently isn't good.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:32.799
Makes sense.

00:18:33.079 --> 00:18:35.640
The internet hasn't been peaceful lately.

00:18:36.039 --> 00:18:37.240
So no variety shows.

00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.359
Forget it, forget it.

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:39.759
Better to keep a low profile.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:40.799
Okay.

00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:44.839
If we get into a lawsuit...

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:45.319
you know?

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.279
Surely...

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.640
we'll be on all kinds of trending topics.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.039
Exactly.

00:18:49.039 --> 00:18:50.599
It will definitely blow up.

00:18:51.039 --> 00:18:53.279
So, keeping a low profile is better.

00:18:53.759 --> 00:18:54.640
Good that you understand.

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.200
It seems your dialogue skills

00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:58.240
have made significant progress.

00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.240
But you are still young.

00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:01.960
The road ahead is long and hard.

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.519
Alright.

00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.599
Brother Maizi, I'll go put on a mask now.

00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.319
You sit here by yourself.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.359
Okay.

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:09.960
I'm leaving now.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:10.640
Go ahead.

00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:11.400
Say no more.

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:12.000
Go.

00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.400
Go, good boy.

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.240
Pour me a glass of water.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.319
Pour one for yourself too.

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:29.119
The kid wants to do stage plays recently.

00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:32.079
The stage builds character, but...

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.680
the money comes too slow.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.279
This is too hard on the agent.

00:19:40.759 --> 00:19:41.400
Xiaotian.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:45.039
Pause your dialogue lessons for a couple of days.

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:48.119
It's hard to get TV roles if your lines are too good.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.680
Excuse me, classmate, coming through.

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.039
This is Donghu Police Station.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.720
Gui Fang has sued you. Come by when you have time.

00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:08.079
What's wrong?

00:20:08.279 --> 00:20:08.960
For real?

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.440
Gui Fang actually sued me.

00:20:10.519 --> 00:20:11.160
What?

00:20:12.279 --> 00:20:13.799
They said I need to go over there too.

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:15.759
But I just reposted it, that's all.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.400
How am I involved?

00:20:17.599 --> 00:20:18.920
I only reposted one thing.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.799
Yeah, they told me to go too.

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.119
Hello?

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.000
I just reposted it, that's all.

00:20:26.599 --> 00:20:27.599
I'll have a stain on my record.

00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:28.680
Then how will I find a job?

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.519
Hurry up and check.

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.519
Is it that serious?

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.920
Is it really necessary just for saying a few words about her?

00:20:35.359 --> 00:20:37.240
It is. Of course it is.

00:20:37.799 --> 00:20:39.039
People live for their dignity.

00:20:39.279 --> 00:20:40.960
If you don't fight for your own dignity,

00:20:41.079 --> 00:20:41.960
who can you count on?

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:43.480
Okay.

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:45.440
I know about this now.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:50.359
The school takes this matter very seriously too.

00:20:53.079 --> 00:20:54.160
Gui Fang, all I can say is...

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.240
the school's position...

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.039
is definitely to protect the students.

00:21:02.519 --> 00:21:03.119
No, no, no.

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:03.759
No.

00:21:04.279 --> 00:21:05.839
Why, why, why is she suing us?

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.480
We're victims too!

00:21:08.559 --> 00:21:09.400
I don't know.

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:12.160
Maybe she's mad at me.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.640
What kind of temper is that?

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:15.400
Brother Maizi, you don't know her.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.039
Gui Fang is really resilient.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.599
She's someone who used just one year

00:21:18.599 --> 00:21:20.079
to raise her math score from the teens

00:21:20.079 --> 00:21:21.599
to over a hundred points.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:23.200
She's quite remarkable.

00:21:23.319 --> 00:21:25.160
And she won't give up easily.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.480
Unless she sees a result.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.599
You... you... you... you really are...

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:30.640
Why did you provoke her?

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.440
Look, look, look.

00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:33.880
It's number three on the trending list.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.440
Do you know what trending number three means?

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:40.079
What does trending number three mean?

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:42.880
This is a good thing!

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:45.640
I can even raise your price.

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:48.160
That's right, seriously.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.880
I got dragged in by your emotions.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.680
What a great opportunity.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.799
Come on, give me your classmate's number.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.640
What's her name again?

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:57.960
Gui... Gui Fang.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:58.839
Give me the phone number.

00:21:59.039 --> 00:21:59.759
I'll contact her.

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.119
Right now...

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:02.319
this is the best...

00:22:03.039 --> 00:22:03.920
chance to operate.

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.160
We'll go with her...

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:07.799
to the court...

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:09.559
and let the state uphold justice for us.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.480
We'll take the moral high ground

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.279
and just stand there.

00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.319
Then your status will shoot right up.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:17.400
Yeah, yeah.

00:22:17.759 --> 00:22:18.920
Brother Maizi, you're so smart.

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.279
You know, you...

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.599
still have a lot to learn.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.480
In the entertainment industry...

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.279
the art of turning danger into safety...

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:26.880
bringing the dead back to... What are you doing?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:28.640
The phone number, right?

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.839
Xiaoyin, I'm here, I'm here.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:33.039
I'm waiting for you right here.

00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:40.920
Hello.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.799
Can I have a word with you?

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.160
You are?

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:45.640
I'm Zhao Chuyi, a senior.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.319
I'll post a clarification and publicly apologize to you.

00:22:48.799 --> 00:22:49.480
Please drop the lawsuit.

00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:50.960
Can you please not make me go to the police station?

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:01.519
You're the one behind the Duda Confessions account. You...

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.240
What you're doing is wrong.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.680
Apologizing and deleting the post are mandatory.

00:23:13.079 --> 00:23:14.359
But you also have to take responsibility

00:23:14.359 --> 00:23:15.000
for what you've done.

00:23:15.279 --> 00:23:16.599
I will. I definitely will.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.480
This is the money from my part-time job this month.

00:23:18.759 --> 00:23:20.440
I'll give you my whole paycheck next month too.

00:23:21.079 --> 00:23:21.960
I run this account

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.240
just to earn some tips.

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.640
My mom is in poor health.

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:27.000
Monthly medical bills have drained the family.

00:23:27.279 --> 00:23:28.039
I can't count on my dad.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.400
I know I was wrong this time.

00:23:31.039 --> 00:23:32.440
But I just don't want my mom to know.

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.720
I'm afraid she'll be sad.

00:23:39.839 --> 00:23:41.119
It hasn't been easy for you, kid.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.079
You think you're the only one with a hard life?

00:23:46.279 --> 00:23:47.240
Life isn't easy for anyone.

00:23:47.519 --> 00:23:48.000
Just because you're struggling

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.640
doesn't mean you can guilt-trip others here, right?

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:50.920
Let me tell you something.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.240
Even for the sake of argument,

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:53.839
even if your life is really that tragic,

00:23:54.079 --> 00:23:55.720
you can't make money by exploiting others.

00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.160
Is that how your mother raised you?

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:05.440
I'm sorry.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:19.000
Gui Fang, I was simply amazing just now.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:20.240
That was simply the most...

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.799
...successful argument of my life.

00:24:23.519 --> 00:24:24.759
Let's go, eat something good to celebrate.

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:25.559
Let's go.

00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.160
That was so satisfying.

00:24:31.759 --> 00:24:33.480
Classmate, take a look at our Haidu Media.

00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:35.680
Classmate, check it out.

00:24:35.839 --> 00:24:36.240
Classmate.

00:24:36.759 --> 00:24:37.160
Classmate.

00:24:38.039 --> 00:24:39.680
It's okay, there's probably no one here.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.400
Why don't you rest for a while?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.400
Classmate.

00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.400
Please take a look.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:44.400
Classmate, Auntie.

00:24:45.079 --> 00:24:45.839
I am the one...

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.799
...who reposted a post online.

00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.559
But I really had no bad intentions.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.920
I just used inappropriate words.

00:24:51.039 --> 00:24:51.680
Just following the trend.

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:52.400
Please drop the lawsuit, Auntie.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:54.000
Auntie, I didn't mean to either.

00:24:54.039 --> 00:24:55.720
My parents sold everything to send me to college.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.279
My family is poor to begin with.

00:24:57.799 --> 00:24:58.279
Gui Fang.

00:24:58.599 --> 00:25:00.000
It's me, Senior Cao.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.079
I-I-I just reposted it.

00:25:01.079 --> 00:25:02.119
How can you be so heartless?

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.680
My dad was just diagnosed with cancer last month.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.119
He's just hoping I graduate well and find a good job.

00:25:05.119 --> 00:25:06.200
How can I explain this to him?

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.720
My mom passed away right after I got into Duda.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:09.559
In the hospital, she hoped I would graduate well.

00:25:09.559 --> 00:25:11.000
So what am I supposed to do now?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.319
You should have some basic logic when playing the victim.

00:25:12.799 --> 00:25:14.799
You said your dad runs every morning and is fit as a fiddle.

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:19.839
Don't fight, don't fight, don't fight.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.680
Stop fighting, the Student Union will deduct credits.

00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:29.319
Mom.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.920
Mom, get up.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.000
What are you doing?

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:34.319
Get up.

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:35.960
Alright, stop fighting.

00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:40.160
Get up. Fighting...

00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:41.519
What are you doing?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.279
Writing so much here...

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.920
People like this are just trying to grab attention.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.400
We probably don't need to...

00:26:01.599 --> 00:26:01.960
Mom.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:04.319
Look at the situation now.

00:26:04.759 --> 00:26:05.839
These young people...

00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:07.720
They're all like this, following the trend.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.759
I... I also follow trends when I'm bored.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.640
Exactly, exactly.

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:11.799
Yes, it's not good either.

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:12.599
But...

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.359
It's not that serious, right?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:17.000
Let's just catch the first few people...

00:26:17.039 --> 00:26:18.079
The ones who started rumors and took photos.

00:26:18.079 --> 00:26:18.920
We just sue them.

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:19.599
No.

00:26:21.079 --> 00:26:22.319
Following the trend makes them perpetrators too.

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:24.000
Yes, but... but...

00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.759
We can't guarantee, right?

00:26:25.839 --> 00:26:28.319
Whether among these people there are some with bad intentions.

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.680
People who hold a grudge.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.000
What if they pull some dirty tricks?

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:32.160
Wouldn't we be at a disadvantage?

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.359
There's no need, let's just avoid it.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:34.680
How can you say that?

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.839
Good people get hurt and have to be careful everywhere?

00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.799
While bad people go unpunished and swagger around?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.039
You are aiding and abetting evil.

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:43.119
You've heard of a thief stealing for a thousand days.

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:44.680
Have you heard of guarding against a thief for a thousand days?

00:26:44.799 --> 00:26:45.519
Can we guard against them?

00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:46.160
Guard every day?

00:26:46.279 --> 00:26:47.680
That's why we must catch those thieves.

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:48.799
Make them pay the price.

00:26:48.799 --> 00:26:49.480
So they dare not do it again.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.519
Fang, let's go.

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:54.599
That's my mom.

00:26:56.359 --> 00:26:57.200
That's my mom.

00:26:57.839 --> 00:26:58.480
Would I really

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:00.920
do anything to her?

00:27:14.599 --> 00:27:16.039
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

00:27:16.559 --> 00:27:17.599
Don't lower yourself to his level.

00:27:17.599 --> 00:27:18.440
Don't hold it against him.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:20.960
Fang, let me show you something.

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:29.079
Did you see what she's wearing today?

00:27:29.119 --> 00:27:30.480
Like an exploded shrimp cake.

00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:32.799
That jackfruit from Class 4.

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:34.440
She seems to think she's so fashionable.

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:35.799
Dressed so weirdly.

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.960
It's really embarrassing.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.359
I started reading fashion magazines when I was little.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.200
When I was in middle school,

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.079
I started trying to make my own clothes to wear.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.839
I made them and wore them myself; I didn't hurt anyone.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.640
But I don't know why,

00:27:48.559 --> 00:27:49.079
one day,

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:51.079
suddenly someone on the school forum

00:27:51.079 --> 00:27:51.960
started a thread to mock me.

00:27:53.319 --> 00:27:54.359
I was too young back then.

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.400
I didn't dare to fight back.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.079
Thinking about it now,

00:27:57.319 --> 00:27:58.599
I just feel very regretful.

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:00.319
I should have grabbed them by the hair back then

00:28:00.319 --> 00:28:01.279
and fought them hard.

00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.039
Otherwise,

00:28:03.599 --> 00:28:04.839
this incident would just become a

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:06.160
wound that will never heal for me.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.599
What they said was too much.

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:10.599
Did your parents not handle this back then?

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:15.160
My mom thought I was in the wrong first.

00:28:15.759 --> 00:28:17.559
Instead, she wouldn't let me touch the sewing machine anymore.

00:28:19.039 --> 00:28:20.960
My dad actually went to school to find the teacher.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.839
He also got a few boys to come out and apologize to me.

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:25.720
But I knew they weren't sincere.

00:28:26.319 --> 00:28:27.519
Later, when they saw me at school,

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:28.680
they would still make faces at me.

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:31.480
Fang,

00:28:32.759 --> 00:28:34.519
just like among those people coming to apologize to you,

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.559
some are seniors looking for jobs

00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:37.440
and don't want to get disciplined.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.200
They aren't truly repenting.

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:40.519
Gui Fang,

00:28:42.039 --> 00:28:43.359
I don't want you to be like me

00:28:44.079 --> 00:28:45.279
and be left with a wound like this.

00:28:50.279 --> 00:28:51.720
Don't feel aggrieved. Don't feel aggrieved.

00:28:54.559 --> 00:28:55.279
No more feeling aggrieved.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:34.480
Hello, Auntie.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.519
We are here to apologize.

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:36.960
Yes.

00:29:37.039 --> 00:29:39.400
We thought Xiaotian... that student...

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:41.200
was being bullied.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.559
We were upholding justice.

00:29:42.759 --> 00:29:43.519
We were one-sided.

00:29:43.759 --> 00:29:45.319
We hope you can forgive us.

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:45.799
Yes.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240
You thought

00:29:49.039 --> 00:29:50.079
Wei Mingtian was being bullied?

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.720
No, no, no.

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.160
No, no.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.400
Where did you get that idea from?

00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.799
Besides,

00:29:56.079 --> 00:29:57.319
spreading rumors about me and helping him,

00:29:57.759 --> 00:29:58.960
is there any connection between the two?

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:01.319
Look, Auntie,

00:30:01.319 --> 00:30:03.160
you can't be so unforgiving.

00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:05.079
Don't you just want us to apologize

00:30:05.319 --> 00:30:06.160
and pay you money?

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.039
Stop talking.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.880
How much money do you want?

00:30:08.079 --> 00:30:09.200
We'll just pay you.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.240
We'll give it all to you.

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.279
You... you can't be so ruthless.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.839
You can't let us actually get disciplined

00:30:13.839 --> 00:30:14.720
just so you'll be happy.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:15.880
Alright, stop talking.

00:30:16.559 --> 00:30:17.519
Um, Auntie,

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.680
we didn't mean that.

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.440
We are sincerely apologizing to you.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:22.319
Then we won't disturb you anymore.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:23.440
Get back to your studies.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:24.559
We're leaving now.

00:30:24.759 --> 00:30:25.079
Bye-bye.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:26.000
Bye-bye.

00:30:28.359 --> 00:30:29.240
Come here, come here.

00:30:29.839 --> 00:30:31.240
What are you two doing?

00:30:31.319 --> 00:30:32.240
Arguing with her like that.

00:30:33.119 --> 00:30:34.240
You, why were you so aggressive with her?

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.079
No, she just... she...

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.640
We can't suffer this loss for nothing.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.200
And besides, in the school,

00:30:40.279 --> 00:30:41.440
surely it's not just the three of us who hate her.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.559
We have to be steady, you know?

00:30:43.799 --> 00:30:44.599
Wait for this to blow over.

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.079
We even bought a fruit basket.

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.000
What a waste.

00:31:00.119 --> 00:31:00.720
Watch out.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.720
Student, are you okay?

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.079
Careful, she might fake an injury.

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:19.920
Watch out, she might sue you.

00:31:51.599 --> 00:31:51.880
No,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.559
yes, they were jumping on the bandwagon with their mockery.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.880
But don't stoop to their level.

00:31:59.039 --> 00:32:00.279
What if they didn't mean any harm?

00:32:00.599 --> 00:32:02.319
Who hasn't made a mistake before?

00:32:02.319 --> 00:32:03.559
Have you never badmouthed anyone?

00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.000
I... that's not what I meant.

00:32:11.799 --> 00:32:12.960
I just went through your Weibo.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.119
This post.

00:32:16.079 --> 00:32:16.680
And this one.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:18.960
Are these things you said?

00:32:20.519 --> 00:32:21.480
That was back when

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.000
that happened, and I stepped in to help.

00:32:23.839 --> 00:32:24.960
Why... why are you digging up my past?

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.200
Because I wanted to know if you jumped on the bandwagon too.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.359
If you also hurt others without realizing it.

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:31.799
That's why you think

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:33.880
those minor hurts don't matter.

00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.319
Anyway, I've never talked about others.

00:32:36.559 --> 00:32:37.400
Never been mean-spirited.

00:32:37.559 --> 00:32:38.839
And never judged anyone.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.440
From my perspective,

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.400
people like me

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.279
are the majority, the normal ones.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.160
If the remaining minority

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.640
cannot restrain their words and actions,

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.920
then let the law restrain them.

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.000
What's wrong?

00:33:18.359 --> 00:33:18.640
Coach.

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.119
What happened?

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:19.960
You're finally here.

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.839
Xu Rui has been running like this all night.

00:33:21.839 --> 00:33:23.200
I can't even stop her.

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:26.200
Good.

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.920
What a fighting spirit this is!

00:33:30.279 --> 00:33:31.160
Truly moving.

00:33:32.039 --> 00:33:32.480
Let me tell you,

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:33.279
in her,

00:33:33.279 --> 00:33:34.880
I see a shadow of my younger self.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.559
No, Coach.

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.640
She can't keep running like this.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.559
Shouldn't we

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.240
increase the training intensity a bit?

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:42.640
Makes sense.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:44.119
Very promising.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.440
But

00:33:45.519 --> 00:33:47.519
a person's stamina has a limit.

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:49.559
You can't keep the training string too tight.

00:33:49.759 --> 00:33:52.160
If it's too tight, isn't she likely

00:33:53.839 --> 00:33:54.559
to get injured?

00:34:06.519 --> 00:34:07.559
Is your foot okay?

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.440
It's just a scratch. I'm fine.

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:15.199
Auntie, don't be sad.

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.960
You were protecting your legitimate rights.

00:34:18.079 --> 00:34:19.199
It wasn't malicious revenge.

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.239
Don't take their words to heart.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.599
I just feel that...

00:34:25.639 --> 00:34:26.840
because of this mess,

00:34:27.039 --> 00:34:28.400
caused you and Xiaocan to fight,

00:34:29.079 --> 00:34:30.920
and brought up bad memories for Xiaoyin.

00:34:32.039 --> 00:34:34.480
Is it worth turning a good life into a mess?

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:38.400
I'm really tired.

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:40.920
I just hope this blows over soon.

00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:41.719
Let's not make it any bigger.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.199
So everyone can live happily like before.

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.000
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:34:50.079 --> 00:34:50.440
Gui Fang.

00:34:51.039 --> 00:34:51.599
Gui Fang! Gui Fang!

00:34:52.039 --> 00:34:52.559
Wait a second, Gui Fang.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.400
I really did it this time.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.320
I can finally help you too.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.960
You... what did you do?

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.559
You're totally famous now.

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.119
On the path of fighting cyberbullying,

00:35:05.159 --> 00:35:06.559
Ms. Kong has shown us

00:35:06.559 --> 00:35:08.199
unparalleled resilient spirit,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.079
becoming a role model for countless people.

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:11.599
Let's also hear

00:35:11.599 --> 00:35:13.440
the public's opinion on this matter.

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:15.320
Excuse me, student.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.800
What do you think about the recent events

00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.400
regarding Ms. Kong Gui Fang?

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.760
You mean about Auntie Kong Gui Fang?

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.360
Yes, yes.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:21.559
This matter has caused a sensation in society.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.360
I think

00:35:22.519 --> 00:35:23.639
this auntie did a great job.

00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.320
She taught me how to handle such things.

00:35:26.039 --> 00:35:26.960
First, collect evidence.

00:35:27.159 --> 00:35:28.039
Public prosecution, suing.

00:35:28.239 --> 00:35:29.920
Learn to use the weapon of law to protect oneself.

00:35:30.039 --> 00:35:31.559
This is what I learned from this matter.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.360
Finally, I want to say to the auntie:

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.079
Auntie,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.400
you have elevated my understanding

00:35:35.559 --> 00:35:36.239
of the law.

00:35:36.679 --> 00:35:37.159
Go Auntie!

00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:38.800
Keep it up! I support you!

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:39.840
Okay.

00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.920
Many thanks to our "Student Elevation."

00:35:42.159 --> 00:35:44.039
We strongly agree with his remarks.

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:46.400
But his behavior on the escalator...

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.360
we strongly advise against imitating.

00:35:48.599 --> 00:35:49.360
You're talking about Kong Gui Fang?

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:50.159
Yes, yes.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.000
I was just watching it.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:53.119
Young people these days...

00:35:53.119 --> 00:35:54.199
they have no idea of the immensity of heaven and earth.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.119
Sir, don't get excited.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.760
If you ask me, they just... just... just...

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.679
just have it too easy.

00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.719
Don't get excited, sir.

00:35:59.719 --> 00:36:00.480
They have nothing to do,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.760
so they think about bullying others.

00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.800
They should be punished by the law.

00:36:04.039 --> 00:36:04.840
Make them fear!

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:05.639
Be afraid!

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.840
Okay sir, please don't get excited.

00:36:07.039 --> 00:36:08.360
Thank you very much for supporting

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.159
our interview.

00:36:11.559 --> 00:36:13.440
Okay, many thanks to "Mr. Excited"

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.480
for his excited remarks.

00:36:14.679 --> 00:36:15.719
But his excited remarks

00:36:15.719 --> 00:36:17.400
have also brought Ms. Kong Gui Fang

00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.559
very strong support.

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:20.639
Okay.

00:36:20.639 --> 00:36:22.960
Hope everyone follows and likes.

00:36:23.119 --> 00:36:23.719
Thank you, everyone.

00:36:24.519 --> 00:36:26.199
Did you hire a team to do this?

00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:27.760
You're so generous.

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:29.000
It wasn't me.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.440
Brother Maizi contacted them.

00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:33.239
But he didn't let me film.

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:34.639
It's a bit of a pity.

00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:38.800
They even did street interviews.

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.119
That's so thoughtful.

00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:41.679
Brother Li Wai spoke well, right?

00:36:43.159 --> 00:36:43.679
And him too.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.480
Li Wai?

00:36:44.719 --> 00:36:45.400
Which one is him?

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.119
They are all him.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.519
Hello, Professor Wang.

00:37:02.159 --> 00:37:02.639
Gui Fang.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.920
The TV station's program team came to the school.

00:37:07.159 --> 00:37:09.480
They proposed filming a special episode.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.400
So tomorrow,

00:37:13.119 --> 00:37:15.960
all students involved in this matter

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:18.239
will be gathered in the lecture hall.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:22.039
The school hopes you can cooperate with the TV interview.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:29.480
I said before,

00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:33.079
the school's stance is always to protect the students.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.719
They are also students of the school.

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:46.000
These are the Weibo posts they wrote.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.400
I plan to clap back at every single one.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:48.000
Take a look.

00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:49.440
Is my comeback good?

00:37:50.199 --> 00:37:51.239
Who's clinging to whom between us?

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.320
I'm clinging to you, right?

00:37:53.239 --> 00:37:54.440
Do you think I'm too clingy?

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:55.159
Are you calling me out?

00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:58.400
Why do you guys look even angrier than me?

00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.960
Gui Fang, I don't want you to end up like me,

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:02.920
left with a wound like this.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.679
But Gui Fang,

00:38:13.039 --> 00:38:15.320
you don't have to do what anyone expects.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.119
I know that in your heart,

00:38:19.079 --> 00:38:20.360
you have your own sense of justice.

00:38:28.719 --> 00:38:29.719
Regarding this footage,

00:38:29.719 --> 00:38:30.880
we'll shoot the exterior again later...

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.199
I told you the school would step in.

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:35.519
After all, they are the school's students.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.639
The law can't punish the masses.

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.519
We have to stick together.

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.159
I know how this works.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.639
Okay.

00:39:16.039 --> 00:39:16.639
Student Kong,

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.039
how are you feeling right now?

00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:21.039
Will you accept a settlement with your classmates?

00:39:24.639 --> 00:39:25.960
If there are classmates today

00:39:27.079 --> 00:39:28.199
who sincerely apologize to me,

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:31.960
I accept.

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:34.599
Yes, our Student Kong

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:36.320
is still very friendly.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:36.960
And she also...

00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:38.400
But regardless of whether they apologize,

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.199
I will not accept a settlement.

00:39:42.599 --> 00:39:44.559
I believe the law and school regulations

00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.360
will give me the fairest result.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.960
I think this auntie did a great job.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.960
Some people just have it too easy.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.320
Go for it! I support you!

00:40:19.559 --> 00:40:20.400
Is my hair okay?

00:40:21.440 --> 00:40:22.039
It's fine.

00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:23.119
I have experience with this.

00:40:23.199 --> 00:40:24.000
I previously filmed

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:26.119
a promotional video for the Public Security Bureau.

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:26.920
I've got experience.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.480
I'm a veteran actor.

00:40:28.199 --> 00:40:29.760
They should be punished by the law!

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.559
Make them fear!

00:40:30.679 --> 00:40:31.679
Fe- fear!

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:32.599
His passionate remarks

00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:34.159
have also given Ms. Kong Gui Fang

00:40:34.159 --> 00:40:35.360
strong support.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.039
Let's interview

00:40:37.079 --> 00:40:38.320
the next enthusiastic viewer.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:41.239
Is there something wrong with you?

00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:41.880
Let me see.

00:40:43.519 --> 00:40:44.800
Look at the people you found.

00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:45.199
No, no.

00:40:45.199 --> 00:40:46.039
You smashed my phone like this.

00:40:46.039 --> 00:40:46.440
Sister, I'm sorry.

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.079
Why did you get so excited?

00:40:48.079 --> 00:40:49.239
I just got caught up in the emotion.

00:40:49.239 --> 00:40:50.320
I... I didn't mean to.

00:40:50.639 --> 00:40:51.559
I can't believe this.

00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:55.599
Let Xiaotian buy you a new one.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:57.400
You dropped it, you pay.
