WEBVTT

01:38.474 --> 01:40.891
The recent
outbreak of the Ebola virus

01:40.974 --> 01:43.266
has now claimed over
100,000 confirmed

01:43.349 --> 01:46.057
victims, at least
a further 30,000

01:46.140 --> 01:49.057
suspected cases. This
Global pandemic is

01:49.140 --> 01:51.432
showing no signs
of slowing down and

01:51.558 --> 01:53.432
infections are out of control.

01:53.933 --> 01:56.266
With no vaccine in sight a
spokesperson from the

01:56.391 --> 01:58.099
World Health
Organization has stated

01:58.224 --> 02:01.432
that humanity is facing
a state of emergency.

02:01.516 --> 02:04.474
Could this be the start
of a new pandemic?

02:23.599 --> 02:26.266
Paul you're late!
Yeah I know,

02:26.349 --> 02:28.266
traffic was crazy.

02:28.391 --> 02:31.724
It's a third time this week,
try to find a better excuse.

02:31.808 --> 02:32.933
Move.

02:33.057 --> 02:37.266
Sorry.
You could have killed us all!

02:37.891 --> 02:39.766
I know.
Get out!

02:39.850 --> 02:42.182
It's all right, calm down,
all right,

02:42.266 --> 02:45.391
He's your friend.
Calm down, it's okay.

02:46.766 --> 02:49.307
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey,

02:49.432 --> 02:54.391
it's all right, it's all right,
it's all right okay.

02:54.474 --> 03:00.307
and um what are we going
to call our little angel hm?

03:00.683 --> 03:03.140
May Lee same
as your grandma.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.307
Hey!

05:59.891 --> 06:01.015
Guzman,

06:01.099 --> 06:03.182
you were charged
with Heroin trafficking,

06:03.266 --> 06:05.850
kidnapping for
pedophile networks and

06:05.933 --> 06:07.432
stealing organs from children.

06:07.516 --> 06:11.516
No, no you're making
a horrible mistake,

06:11.599 --> 06:16.057
you have the wrong man,
I don't know who hired you

06:16.140 --> 06:19.015
but you have the wrong target,
please let me explain.

06:19.099 --> 06:21.516
My employers are never wrong.

06:31.266 --> 06:36.891
May, you all right?
I'm okay it's nothing,

06:38.266 --> 06:40.766
Babe it's not nothing, that's

06:40.891 --> 06:42.850
Ebola virus!

06:42.933 --> 06:45.266
It's too late, Anada.

06:45.391 --> 06:47.808
maybe it's not too
late for our child.

06:47.933 --> 06:52.140
It's too dangerous
we have no choices.

06:55.933 --> 06:59.349
We must keep going okay!

07:26.974 --> 07:29.307
No give her pethadine.

07:30.850 --> 07:33.266
It's too soon, due
day's in 5 weeks.

07:35.266 --> 07:37.599
Prepare for surgery.
We should be okay.

07:37.683 --> 07:39.683
We should be all right please!

07:39.766 --> 07:41.850
I had a student once,
she was like a

07:42.850 --> 07:45.766
a like a daughter
to me. An Angel...

07:45.891 --> 07:49.140
of Death... she she was perfect.

07:52.266 --> 07:53.891
I love you.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.683
But at 14 she
graduated and left me

07:57.766 --> 07:59.224
to

08:00.432 --> 08:01.974
to complete her training.

08:03.266 --> 08:05.307
That's the rules.

08:07.850 --> 08:10.349
I know I wrote them.

08:17.974 --> 08:19.766
Fall in, let's go!

08:48.766 --> 08:50.015
Anada!

08:50.099 --> 08:53.140
Is this her blood? are you sure?

08:53.266 --> 08:55.349
I checked everything
several times,

08:55.432 --> 08:57.432
as soon as I put her
blood in contact with the

08:57.516 --> 08:58.808
virus of May Lee,

08:58.933 --> 09:01.349
her immune system
reacts and inhibits it.

09:02.391 --> 09:04.724
Do you realize what
you've created,

09:05.224 --> 09:07.516
do you realize the impact
of such a discovery?

09:08.432 --> 09:10.766
Run more test on
her with other strains.

09:10.891 --> 09:12.850
No, nothing
has been validated

09:12.933 --> 09:15.266
we must say and do nothing!

09:15.349 --> 09:17.224
Please don't say
anything to anyone,

09:17.307 --> 09:19.933
I don't want my daughter
to become a GUINEA PIG!

09:20.266 --> 09:22.641
Think about what you're saying!

09:23.140 --> 09:27.516
She could save millions
and millions of lives!

09:27.974 --> 09:31.641
I lost
my wife to science!

09:31.766 --> 09:34.391
and I won't lose
my daughter too!

09:34.974 --> 09:37.766
Nothing is proven,
it is inconclusive

09:37.850 --> 09:40.766
and then what, a
vaccine to save who?

09:41.391 --> 09:46.349
Hey we talk to no
one, you understand?

09:46.432 --> 09:48.307
no one!

09:58.599 --> 10:01.766
We
have found something very big,

10:01.891 --> 10:04.099
the key is in the blood
of another's daughter.

10:07.558 --> 10:09.766
He will be a problem

10:09.891 --> 10:14.140
Okay....okay.

10:20.224 --> 10:23.349
Your dad will always
protect you little one.

10:32.224 --> 10:34.266
take her far away from here

10:34.391 --> 10:37.140
I warned her
grandmother already.

10:50.766 --> 10:52.974
What time do you call this?

10:53.099 --> 10:54.933
you'll be late for
your funeral man

10:55.057 --> 10:57.558
you will.
Oh no he won't.

11:03.558 --> 11:05.140
Who the hell are you?

11:05.266 --> 11:09.808
Your daughter is an extremely
valuable asset to my employers

11:09.933 --> 11:12.099
whose interests
include financial gain

11:12.182 --> 11:15.558
Global power and of
course her well-being.

11:15.641 --> 11:17.808
She is safe.

11:18.432 --> 11:20.766
You can do this
the easy way or the

11:20.850 --> 11:23.599
hard way, it's up to you.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.266
You can go to hell! I thought
so, the hard way it is.

11:41.391 --> 11:45.266
With or without you,
we'll find her.

12:11.015 --> 12:12.974
Move move move!

12:37.933 --> 12:39.432
You're looking for a girl right?

12:39.516 --> 12:41.558
All of them,

12:42.599 --> 12:44.266
test every single one of them.

12:55.558 --> 12:57.099
This one.

13:01.599 --> 13:04.808
Leave her alone don't touch her.

13:04.933 --> 13:06.224
I got this.

13:08.099 --> 13:10.057
Step aside Grandpa.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.182
No, I won't let you

13:15.766 --> 13:17.766
Okay.

13:49.766 --> 13:52.099
Sample 22, it's a match.

13:52.724 --> 13:54.182
Her!

13:55.057 --> 13:57.432
Stop her!

13:59.933 --> 14:02.558
No no NO!
I need her alive,

14:02.641 --> 14:05.182
go go go go get the girl.

14:08.599 --> 14:10.891
Make her come back.
No!

14:10.974 --> 14:14.099
Make her come back.
NO!

14:16.224 --> 14:18.307
Round them all
up, I want them in

14:18.432 --> 14:22.766
this hut right back here,

14:22.891 --> 14:34.140
lets go move move.

15:25.266 --> 15:26.766
What's the news?

15:26.850 --> 15:28.432
I got in touch with our friend.

15:28.558 --> 15:29.766
He had failed.

15:29.891 --> 15:31.432
Partly.
Is it really reasonable,

15:31.558 --> 15:34.432
to hire a member of the MI6

15:34.558 --> 15:36.057
to take care of our business?

15:36.140 --> 15:38.558
He left the agency,
and you know that

15:38.641 --> 15:41.766
at the same time he always
evolved on his own account,

15:41.850 --> 15:44.057
then it keeps you,
out of the game.

15:44.140 --> 15:46.266
No more errors this
time Mr Delgado.

15:46.391 --> 15:47.391
Guarantee.

15:47.474 --> 15:48.766
By the way,

15:48.891 --> 15:53.182
we have confirmation,
other parties are in play.

15:53.266 --> 15:57.683
I know.
Everything we have tried

15:57.766 --> 16:01.349
since the last 20 years,
has had no effect,

16:01.432 --> 16:05.307
the only solution
is to find that girl

16:05.432 --> 16:08.266
We need her blood.
If we develop a vaccine

16:08.391 --> 16:10.850
against our Ebola virus,

16:10.933 --> 16:13.516
we will reach the Grail,
we will become a state

16:13.599 --> 16:14.974
in the state.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.766
Do you understand Mr Delgado?

16:17.891 --> 16:20.015
Maybe it was better
to wait a little bit,

16:20.099 --> 16:21.850
before launching
this process.

16:21.933 --> 16:25.724
Impossible, it's no longer
time for discussion and

16:25.808 --> 16:28.516
failure is not an option.

16:28.599 --> 16:30.266
There will be no problem...

16:30.391 --> 16:31.474
trust me.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.474
Maya please take
him to the infirmary

17:41.599 --> 17:43.099
I'll see to him later.

17:50.558 --> 17:52.307
Delgado!

17:52.432 --> 17:53.766
Good morning.

17:53.850 --> 17:56.891
Happy to see you
again Mr Steiner.

17:57.766 --> 17:59.599
Thank you for
coming all this way

17:59.724 --> 18:00.933
on such a short notice.

18:01.015 --> 18:03.432
A first class ticket and
50,000 in expenses will

18:03.516 --> 18:05.266
do that every time.

18:05.391 --> 18:06.432
Please have a seat,

18:07.516 --> 18:08.558
you want some breakfast?

18:09.599 --> 18:11.140
No it's fine,
just some coffee.

18:16.891 --> 18:19.808
So I've heard that
you left the MI6,

18:19.933 --> 18:23.182
people like us
never retire do they.

18:24.933 --> 18:26.724
How can I help you?

18:31.766 --> 18:33.724
Do you remember May Lee?

18:40.266 --> 18:41.850
Of course.

18:43.641 --> 18:45.933
I thought she was dead

18:46.974 --> 18:49.808
I spent weeks in that
godforsaken jungle,

18:49.933 --> 18:51.266
looking for that girl.

18:52.349 --> 18:53.516
Weeks!

18:53.599 --> 18:56.850
It took 10 years to locate
her in her Village,

18:56.933 --> 18:59.432
and another 10 years
to find her now,

19:00.891 --> 19:03.850
in any case, she's
still alive and my

19:03.933 --> 19:06.850
partners want her at any price.

19:08.558 --> 19:14.599
You see a new outbreak
can occur at any time

19:14.724 --> 19:17.933
so our sponsor just
wants to be ready,

19:18.015 --> 19:19.850
to save the world.

19:19.933 --> 19:23.057
Worth billions to your
sponsors big pharma,

19:23.140 --> 19:25.516
and just about any
government in the world huh?

19:26.724 --> 19:27.933
Yes.

19:29.182 --> 19:31.974
This is what we
believe she looks like now,

19:32.099 --> 19:36.474
and our informants think
she's hiding in Bangkok,

19:36.599 --> 19:40.933
a city of 18 million people
with lot of places to hide.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.516
We already sent some men but

19:44.599 --> 19:46.224
without success.

19:46.307 --> 19:49.224
So you want me to go in
and clean up your mess?

19:49.307 --> 19:52.558
You burned an entire
village to the ground,

19:52.641 --> 19:54.266
and killed her grandparents.

19:54.349 --> 19:56.766
We were operating
on Thai territory,

19:56.850 --> 19:58.140
without their consent.

19:58.266 --> 19:59.474
Shit happens.

20:00.307 --> 20:03.391
So you want to back
alive this time I presume?

20:04.474 --> 20:05.850
Alive...

20:05.933 --> 20:07.307
at all costs,

20:07.432 --> 20:10.307
we need her as a lab rat.

20:11.933 --> 20:13.766
There are other
groups on the ground,

20:13.891 --> 20:15.891
you will have competition...

20:17.724 --> 20:19.683
listen we have to be the

20:19.766 --> 20:22.266
first to find her,
we spend considerable

20:22.391 --> 20:24.766
sum in trying to
sway public opinion,

20:24.850 --> 20:26.683
no-one believed in
the importance of

20:26.766 --> 20:29.766
Anti-Ebola remedy,
so we were forced to

20:29.850 --> 20:32.766
give nature a
helping hand.

20:32.891 --> 20:35.182
So you need me to bring
her back alive so you can

20:35.266 --> 20:37.432
have control over the vaccine

20:37.558 --> 20:38.974
Absolutely...

20:39.474 --> 20:41.349
but now...

20:41.432 --> 20:44.099
time is also our enemy,

20:46.224 --> 20:48.307
please consider this
as an advance

20:48.432 --> 20:51.724
for your services.
Please use all means.

20:51.808 --> 20:53.391
you deem appropriate.

20:53.808 --> 20:54.974
Dead's a hell of a lot

20:55.099 --> 20:56.599
easier to transport.

20:56.724 --> 20:59.766
Alive, Mr Steiner.... alive...

21:00.432 --> 21:06.808
that is the contract, she
is the key to everything.

21:34.558 --> 21:37.099
Good morning children!

21:37.182 --> 21:40.057
So, everything you undertake

21:40.140 --> 21:43.224
must be done with
faith and resolution.

21:43.307 --> 21:46.432
Whatever the result is,
it's the path that counts.

21:47.766 --> 21:50.349
Who doesn't agree?

21:50.432 --> 21:51.599
Yes?

21:51.683 --> 21:56.015
Sister, I'd rather
take an elevator,

21:56.099 --> 21:58.808
than climb 30 floors.

21:58.933 --> 22:02.724
Yesss!

22:02.808 --> 22:05.057
Of course, of course.

22:05.641 --> 22:07.349
But what would make

22:07.432 --> 22:09.057
your body stronger?

22:09.140 --> 22:11.099
what would forge your spirit?

22:11.182 --> 22:13.474
the elevator or
climbing up the stairs?

22:15.307 --> 22:17.599
Come on let's go to work.

22:26.140 --> 22:29.683
Oh Lord give me the strength,

22:30.099 --> 22:31.558
well do I have to
wait till Christmas

22:31.641 --> 22:33.432
for someone to help me?

22:35.182 --> 22:39.516
Yeah.... good...
so strong.

22:42.891 --> 22:46.057
Ask and your wish
will be granted,

22:46.140 --> 22:48.307
there's no prayer
that God can't hear.

22:49.474 --> 22:51.599
Can your elevator do this?

22:58.099 --> 23:01.057
I pray to God my child,
that one day

23:01.140 --> 23:03.558
I'll hear the sound
of your voice.

23:32.558 --> 23:34.182
I'm okay.

23:34.266 --> 23:38.266
Don't worry, leftovers
from Malaria.

23:40.766 --> 23:43.099
Go back to work.

23:49.099 --> 23:51.099
Takes as much as he gives.

24:33.891 --> 24:36.432
Ah Mr Steiner returning
to your roots?

24:36.558 --> 24:38.349
You're psychoanalyst now?

24:39.015 --> 24:40.224
How's the girl?

24:40.307 --> 24:42.766
Good but hard to control,
she needs to learn to

24:42.850 --> 24:44.432
exercise some restraint.

24:44.558 --> 24:48.391
She coded yet?
No not yet,

24:48.474 --> 24:53.432
Sebastian stop!
Sebastian stop!

24:53.516 --> 24:55.140
SEBASTIAN!

24:55.266 --> 24:56.808
Sabine!

25:06.933 --> 25:10.307
Hello darling, you look like
you're in fighting form.

25:10.432 --> 25:11.974
Mr Steiner...

25:12.099 --> 25:14.599
I haven't forgotten
your advice sir.

25:14.724 --> 25:16.099
Still knives huh?

25:16.599 --> 25:17.558
Yes.

25:19.224 --> 25:21.891
I've got an assignment for you.

25:32.641 --> 25:34.224
What are we doing here?

25:35.599 --> 25:37.558
We came for him.

25:38.808 --> 25:40.432
Construction.

25:44.099 --> 25:46.099
Where does he come from?

25:47.266 --> 25:51.140
Ukrainian origin former
mercenary in Chechnya,

25:51.266 --> 25:54.474
When I first met him,
he was a mess,

25:54.974 --> 25:57.391
no family no future no...

25:57.474 --> 25:58.933
no purpose.

25:59.015 --> 26:03.766
I took him in gave his life
meaning again,

26:09.766 --> 26:11.850
Shit, this guy is good!

26:12.808 --> 26:15.432
Our guy is the
one getting hit.

26:15.516 --> 26:16.474
What?

26:19.349 --> 26:20.558
Let's go.

26:23.307 --> 26:27.015
Where's the dope you fuck?
we gave you the money,

26:27.099 --> 26:29.182
I want my fucking merchandise.

26:37.933 --> 26:40.808
he whistles, let's kill him!

26:40.933 --> 26:43.974
I gave him 10K in
advance and I'm not

26:44.099 --> 26:46.724
getting fucked
by this ugly cunt.

26:48.933 --> 26:52.307
Game's over sweetheart,
last chance

26:52.432 --> 26:55.516
or you'll be whistling with the
fucking angels.

26:55.599 --> 26:57.182
Where's my money?

27:15.933 --> 27:16.933
No, no no no.

27:17.015 --> 27:18.391
he's fine watch.

27:42.099 --> 27:44.099
Mr Steiner,

27:44.182 --> 27:46.599
you didn't have to interfere
I had the situation

27:46.724 --> 27:48.182
completely under control.

27:48.266 --> 27:51.099
I see that, but I wanted
to introduce you to our

27:51.182 --> 27:53.974
company's newest asset
Sebastian.

27:54.099 --> 27:55.182
Tak

27:55.266 --> 27:57.015
I guess if it's for an official

27:57.099 --> 27:58.724
introduction it's all right.

27:58.808 --> 28:00.140
Good to meet you.

28:01.224 --> 28:03.641
We have an assignment
in Thailand

28:04.099 --> 28:05.349
I'll explain later.

28:06.057 --> 28:09.349
Official?
No.

28:09.432 --> 28:11.974
Private... let's go.

28:12.099 --> 28:13.224
Do-bray

29:02.057 --> 29:06.891
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee,

29:06.974 --> 29:10.224
blessed is the fruit
of thy womb Jesus,

29:11.724 --> 29:14.266
Hail Mary, Mother of God,

29:14.850 --> 29:16.933
pray for us sinners
now and at the

29:17.057 --> 29:19.516
hour of our death.

29:56.766 --> 29:59.599
Yeah we just landed,
Delgado call you?

30:01.683 --> 30:02.808
any news?

30:05.307 --> 30:06.307
who?

30:07.599 --> 30:09.558
The French,

30:10.432 --> 30:12.015
it's not a problem.

30:13.099 --> 30:15.057
We've got company.

30:16.850 --> 30:19.766
So we still have a lot
to do for our charity,

30:19.891 --> 30:21.808
so I'll give you these and

30:21.933 --> 30:23.891
I'll meet you back
at the chapel okay.

30:36.891 --> 30:39.683
Don't worry, everthing
will be alright.

31:11.057 --> 31:15.182
Womans voice shouts
in a foreign language]

32:20.266 --> 32:23.432
She's in the bedroom, we
just found her in the street.

32:35.391 --> 32:37.182
It's not her.

32:37.766 --> 32:40.558
Well we can do
this the easy way,

32:40.974 --> 32:43.599
or the Sebastian Way.

32:43.933 --> 32:46.599
They won't fit in a suitcase!

32:46.724 --> 32:48.391
Oh yes they will.

35:24.933 --> 35:27.307
Steiner, please have a seat,

35:34.724 --> 35:38.432
Nop, my top tip man,

35:38.974 --> 35:40.683
that intel you gave me on that

35:40.766 --> 35:42.641
French crew was outstanding.

35:42.766 --> 35:43.891
Thanks.

35:43.974 --> 35:46.766
I work with Delgado
from time to time,

35:46.891 --> 35:49.099
when he told me you
were back in the game,

35:49.224 --> 35:52.850
after all this year, I don't
want to miss the show.

35:53.933 --> 35:56.099
You're still working
for Uncle Scam?

35:56.224 --> 36:00.683
he's the only one
who can still afford to pay.

36:00.766 --> 36:02.850
I can arrange that.

36:03.974 --> 36:06.140
But if you want to pay more?

36:12.933 --> 36:15.891
Take care of that thing
I asked you about?

36:15.974 --> 36:20.099
I have a lead, I'll
bring you down tomorrow.

36:22.766 --> 36:23.850
Perfect.

37:10.850 --> 37:13.891
Excuse me, sister, can you
spare a minute

37:13.974 --> 37:16.683
for an old... uh alter boy?

37:21.099 --> 37:30.432
I've got a present for you.

37:30.516 --> 37:32.099
How can I help you?

37:33.057 --> 37:34.766
Well we're here with an NGO

37:34.850 --> 37:36.224
traveling around the
country trying to

37:36.307 --> 37:39.599
assess the needs
uh for institutions

37:39.683 --> 37:41.891
like this for food
and clothing and

37:41.974 --> 37:43.683
medical and school supplies,

37:43.766 --> 37:47.850
things like that and
you can help by uh..

37:47.933 --> 37:50.349
letting us know how many
children you have here,

37:50.432 --> 37:53.057
how many boys, girls what
their ethnic backgrounds are.

37:53.140 --> 37:55.099
They're all God's children,

37:55.182 --> 37:58.099
we don't distinguish
between them here,

37:58.182 --> 38:00.224
we don't always know
where they came from,

38:00.307 --> 38:02.349
but we do know where they
want to go.

38:02.432 --> 38:05.558
Where is that?
To meet their lord and saviour.

38:07.266 --> 38:08.224
Of course.

38:10.808 --> 38:13.641
Have you been
working here long?

38:13.766 --> 38:14.974
Long enough.

38:17.641 --> 38:21.224
So you can help us?

38:25.724 --> 38:27.474
If it is to write down personal

38:27.599 --> 38:30.432
information about my
children I won't do that,

38:30.558 --> 38:32.266
but I can provide a list of our

38:32.391 --> 38:36.599
most urgent needs like
medicine, rice, clothes.

38:36.724 --> 38:39.474
We can do all of that
and much more.

38:41.432 --> 38:43.182
I'm happy to show you.

38:47.933 --> 38:51.099
The dormitories are too small,

38:54.933 --> 38:58.099
The infirmary has to
be entirely rebuilt,

38:58.182 --> 39:01.349
and so do the
sanitation facilities.

39:01.432 --> 39:02.599
Hey there kids.

39:03.641 --> 39:04.850
Hi.

39:06.724 --> 39:08.766
What you guys doing?

39:08.891 --> 39:12.474
Yeah.
Cool can I sit 'cuz my knees

39:12.599 --> 39:14.349
kind of hurt?
Yeah.

39:14.432 --> 39:16.850
Thank you, thank you.

39:20.391 --> 39:23.558
You guys want to see
a magic trick?

39:23.641 --> 39:25.474
Yes.

39:26.182 --> 39:27.766
What are you doing?
You need a job as a

39:27.850 --> 39:29.599
a babysitter or what?

39:29.724 --> 39:30.724
Shut up.

39:32.266 --> 39:35.933
Where do you think
you're going? just sit down.

39:36.766 --> 39:38.015
I'm going to...

39:38.099 --> 39:39.808
No you're not going
to your room.

39:39.933 --> 39:41.474
Where's your sister?

39:41.933 --> 39:43.974
I don't have a sister.
Where is your sister?

39:44.099 --> 39:45.349
I don't have a sister.

39:45.432 --> 39:47.140
What do you mean you
don't have a sister,

39:47.266 --> 39:49.015
you know what happens to
little boys who lie?

39:49.099 --> 39:50.724
you know what
happens to them?

39:50.808 --> 39:52.599
okay where's this big girl,
the tall girl?

39:52.683 --> 39:53.724
She's gone.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.432
Come!

40:00.850 --> 40:04.266
Children come here,
the devil is everywhere.

40:05.891 --> 40:08.182
Vassilief, Sebastian, what
do you say we leave

40:08.266 --> 40:10.599
the good Sister here
with her children

40:10.724 --> 40:15.724
and uh we'll come back
another time hey.

40:35.724 --> 40:38.558
You know her?
Why would I know a nun!

40:39.182 --> 40:42.891
I'll tell you one thing,
I don't like her eyes.

40:43.599 --> 40:46.432
and I definitely don't
like the way she moves.

40:46.558 --> 40:48.432
She's just God's slut!

40:49.766 --> 40:52.974
If you want Mr Steiner,
I can take care of her for you.

40:53.099 --> 40:55.224
Not yet... trust me.

40:55.307 --> 40:57.641
she'll have something
for us real soon.

41:00.266 --> 41:01.224
So?

41:02.808 --> 41:05.015
Your Intel's reliable but uh

41:05.099 --> 41:06.974
we're going to have
to come back later

41:07.099 --> 41:09.182
But there's a problem.

41:09.266 --> 41:12.474
Yeah what's that?

41:13.307 --> 41:17.057
there's another man,
seriously interest in our girl,

41:17.432 --> 41:22.307
a russian and he is
not really discreet.

41:24.850 --> 41:26.432
I'll take care of that.

41:37.933 --> 41:39.432
Sister! Sister!

41:39.516 --> 41:42.349
May Lee's gone.
What do you mean she's gone?

41:42.432 --> 41:44.766
All her things are gone.

42:38.015 --> 42:40.599
I didn't have a
family anymore and

42:40.683 --> 42:44.182
she welcomed me,
I had no hope and

42:44.266 --> 42:48.266
she gave me love,
I was filled with rage

42:48.391 --> 42:51.432
and she gave me peace,
I had nothing and I

42:51.516 --> 42:55.933
I found a sister, a mother,

42:56.057 --> 42:58.599
a friend, I cannot say it,

42:58.724 --> 43:02.974
I can only write it,
thank you Gina!

43:25.349 --> 43:26.432
Maya?

43:26.516 --> 43:29.349
Sister, we searched for
May Lee everywhere,

43:29.432 --> 43:31.266
but we couldn't find her.

43:31.391 --> 43:33.307
I'll find her.

44:04.516 --> 44:06.432
Kak de-la?

44:06.516 --> 44:08.307
Who are you?

44:08.432 --> 44:10.974
What am I doing here?

44:11.099 --> 44:13.933
You're not in a position to
be asking any questions.

44:14.015 --> 44:16.432
What's going on?
Let me explain.

44:17.224 --> 44:20.850
You see that tube, with
the tap on the end of it?

44:21.974 --> 44:24.724
it's attached directly to
your femoral artery

44:24.808 --> 44:27.140
so if we open it,

44:27.266 --> 44:32.140
your blood spills out
all over the floor,

44:32.850 --> 44:36.224
but... if you cooperate

44:37.099 --> 44:38.683
we can fill you back up with

44:38.766 --> 44:40.474
fresh healthy blood,

44:40.933 --> 44:44.516
that..... that sound good?

44:44.599 --> 44:47.015
You are insane!

44:47.099 --> 44:52.140
Actually... I'm an artist,

44:53.140 --> 44:54.933
of course I could put
a gun in your mouth,

44:55.057 --> 44:58.724
or go to work on you
with a power drill,

44:58.808 --> 45:00.933
but... no.

45:01.850 --> 45:03.432
no...

45:03.558 --> 45:06.766
you see I invent things,

45:06.850 --> 45:09.224
I create.

45:11.307 --> 45:17.349
So what is your real name
and what are you doing here?

45:19.933 --> 45:22.724
I'm waiting.

45:22.808 --> 45:28.599
Dokan, Cyril Dokan,
and I'm here for business

45:28.724 --> 45:30.432
what kind of business Cyril?

45:30.516 --> 45:33.474
Import, export

45:33.599 --> 45:35.099
Ah Cyril.

45:35.974 --> 45:38.683
Come on now, you know
you can do so

45:38.766 --> 45:40.349
much better than that.

45:40.432 --> 45:45.724
I'm a diplomat I swear,
look at my passport.

45:45.808 --> 45:47.182
Two minutes.

45:50.432 --> 45:55.766
Okay okay I'm looking
for a young woman.

45:58.808 --> 46:01.808
you see
what happens Cyril,

46:01.933 --> 46:03.683
when you're nice, hmm?

46:03.766 --> 46:06.099
Anything else?

46:06.182 --> 46:10.015
No nothing else I, I work
for a friend...

46:10.099 --> 46:12.307
and he's looking for his fiance.

46:12.432 --> 46:15.724
Fucking fiance huh?

46:15.808 --> 46:17.933
Strangle you!

46:25.683 --> 46:27.766
Okay... okay.

46:28.641 --> 46:32.099
I was sent by r.. russian labs,

46:32.224 --> 46:36.599
they want the girl, she
lives in the congregation

46:36.683 --> 46:38.057
in the care of some nun.

46:38.140 --> 46:41.057
A,a,a,a, ah!

46:41.140 --> 46:44.182
Tomorrow we go back
to visit the nun.

46:44.266 --> 46:46.432
She's the key.

46:51.057 --> 46:54.182
Cyril, I'm afraid you no
longer serve any

46:54.266 --> 46:55.349
purpose for me.

46:55.432 --> 46:57.933
Please!
Don't worry,

46:59.099 --> 47:02.140
this won't take long comrade.

47:02.266 --> 47:06.641
Please stop I don't want to die

47:31.099 --> 47:32.891
Have you seen this girl?

47:36.099 --> 47:37.057
No!

47:38.432 --> 47:40.724
Have you seen this girl?

47:44.933 --> 47:47.599
Are you sure, it's very
important I find her

47:47.724 --> 47:49.766
she may be in danger!
Bye!

49:38.432 --> 49:40.558
Give me a minute, please.

49:46.724 --> 49:48.182
What!

49:48.266 --> 49:50.891
If we get the girl
back before Steiner,

49:50.974 --> 49:54.432
how about a little bonus?

49:54.516 --> 49:58.099
We have a deal and you
know who Steiner is,

49:58.933 --> 50:02.266
you will do well, by
providing your information but,

50:02.391 --> 50:06.850
do not ever try this
kind of shit on me.

50:14.099 --> 50:16.099
Well hello again sister,

50:17.099 --> 50:18.891
I told you we'd be back.

50:21.474 --> 50:25.140
How kind of you, I have
prayed for your soul.

50:25.266 --> 50:28.432
I'm afraid I'm not sure
I have one of those.

50:28.516 --> 50:31.891
Yeah and I'm an atheist, so.

50:31.974 --> 50:34.766
Sebastian, sister here
is a servant of God,

50:34.891 --> 50:36.224
she preaches

50:36.307 --> 50:39.140
forgiveness isn't
that right sister.

50:40.516 --> 50:42.474
God will forgive any sin if

50:42.599 --> 50:44.850
repentance is sincere,

50:44.933 --> 50:48.015
ask and you shall receive.

50:48.099 --> 50:49.933
I'm afraid I struggle with

50:50.057 --> 50:53.015
sincerity, unless of course

50:53.099 --> 50:54.474
I'm threatening someone

50:57.933 --> 51:00.683
That complicates
things a little.

51:01.099 --> 51:04.057
Enough with the game sister,

51:05.057 --> 51:06.432
where's the girl?

51:06.974 --> 51:09.099
I don't know what
you're talking about.

51:09.516 --> 51:11.432
Well I think maybe it's

51:12.599 --> 51:14.850
time for your
confession sister.

51:15.516 --> 51:19.766
Only God has the power.

51:25.266 --> 51:26.641
God and Me

51:27.015 --> 51:29.015
Now where is she?

51:29.099 --> 51:33.224
I don't know who
you're talking about.

51:34.891 --> 51:47.432
]

51:47.516 --> 51:50.057
Where is May Lee?

52:04.057 --> 52:06.683
Where is the girl?

52:06.766 --> 52:09.974
What do we do with her?

52:12.182 --> 52:13.724
Well after the dose
you just gave her,

52:13.808 --> 52:15.266
she doesn't have long.

52:16.391 --> 52:18.140
She'll be dead soon,

52:20.558 --> 52:23.266
she's all yours.

52:25.140 --> 52:29.558
Pretty sexy for a nun.
Me first.

54:22.891 --> 54:25.432
So you know that for sure.
100%

54:27.266 --> 54:31.182
Yes my contact thinks,
she's on the way to the

54:31.266 --> 54:33.516
Burmes border,

54:34.015 --> 54:36.349
I already contact
my friend there.

54:36.432 --> 54:38.474
they're waiting
for you at Chanburi.

54:38.599 --> 54:42.307
I have select the crew
that will go with you.

54:42.432 --> 54:44.099
they're downstair.

54:44.974 --> 54:48.599
And who uh is this?

54:48.724 --> 54:52.266
He is my brother,

54:53.724 --> 54:56.266
He doesn't look
very much like you.

54:58.933 --> 55:02.224
He saved my life, he must more
than blood brother,

55:02.933 --> 55:05.266
and you can trust him.

55:09.933 --> 55:12.850
But can I trust you now,
that's the

55:12.933 --> 55:14.516
important question.

55:17.641 --> 55:19.140
Yes.

55:22.182 --> 55:27.558
Excellent... you better
pray it stays that way.

55:39.015 --> 55:41.266
I don't need to hide anymore.

56:48.349 --> 56:50.349
I'm looking for a young
girl called May Lee.

56:52.224 --> 56:54.099
I will spare whoever
gives me the information

56:54.224 --> 56:58.850
I need, the rest of you,
I will kill.

57:02.140 --> 57:05.182
Who is your boss?
who do you work for?

57:11.599 --> 57:13.140
Touch me one more
time and I'll be

57:13.266 --> 57:14.724
the last thing you
see in this world.

57:50.099 --> 57:53.349
No!... No, no no, NO!

58:07.266 --> 58:10.432
So, do you want to
touch my hair again?

58:10.516 --> 58:12.015
You can if you want.

58:12.974 --> 58:14.307
So soft isn't it.

58:16.391 --> 58:19.224
Okay now that we're
intimate, tell me

58:19.307 --> 58:20.599
who is your boss?

58:22.432 --> 58:24.891
Give me a name
and I leave you alive.

58:27.808 --> 58:30.307
And where can
I find this Nop!

58:33.974 --> 58:36.766
Okay... and where is he now?

58:45.391 --> 58:48.808
You're right, I have to
stop killing people like this.

58:51.391 --> 58:52.391
Thank you.

58:56.974 --> 58:59.266
Just kidding.

59:08.766 --> 59:11.224
Hi honey,
can I go in?

59:11.307 --> 59:12.474
Stop...

59:13.558 --> 59:15.683
you go in?

59:15.766 --> 59:18.099
Yeah...

59:31.808 --> 59:32.974
You can't move?

59:33.099 --> 59:34.683
don't worry it's quite normal,

59:34.766 --> 59:36.933
it's just paralysis,

59:38.224 --> 59:40.474
it's the spinal cord which has
been cut right above the

59:40.599 --> 59:42.099
first thoracic vertebrae,

59:42.724 --> 59:46.140
now where is your BOSS?

59:51.224 --> 59:52.432
Okay.

01:00:13.182 --> 01:00:14.182
Come on.

01:00:40.266 --> 01:00:41.349
Hi.

01:00:46.307 --> 01:00:47.349
Drink.

01:00:59.558 --> 01:01:01.140
Do you know who I am?

01:01:02.432 --> 01:01:04.266
A walking dead.

01:01:04.808 --> 01:01:06.850
I work for the CIA and MI6.

01:01:06.933 --> 01:01:08.891
believe me it's overrated.

01:01:08.974 --> 01:01:11.474
You work for whoever pays you.

01:01:11.599 --> 01:01:14.432
MI6, CIA same shit.

01:01:14.558 --> 01:01:16.182
Who the fuck are you huh?

01:01:16.266 --> 01:01:18.683
The worst thing that'll
ever happen to you.

01:01:18.766 --> 01:01:20.432
You're just a fucking nun!

01:01:21.516 --> 01:01:22.850
I was.

01:01:24.182 --> 01:01:25.850
Okay now that
introductions are done,

01:01:25.933 --> 01:01:27.974
you will answer my questions.

01:01:28.099 --> 01:01:30.349
You think you can just
ask me a question and

01:01:30.432 --> 01:01:34.140
I'm going to answer?
is that what you think? uhu?

01:01:34.266 --> 01:01:35.808
No...

01:01:35.933 --> 01:01:37.766
I think you're going to
suffer so much,

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:39.724
that you're going to
answer my questions and

01:01:39.808 --> 01:01:41.933
then you'll beg
me to kill you.

01:01:44.057 --> 01:01:48.558
Tell me now, why does the
CIA MI6 and three killers

01:01:48.641 --> 01:01:50.099
want a little girl?

01:01:51.933 --> 01:01:53.015
I can't speak

01:01:59.558 --> 01:02:01.432
Don't worry, it's a high-speed

01:02:01.558 --> 01:02:03.933
bullet that penetrated between
your pectoral muscle

01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:05.974
and the artery behind
your collar bone

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:09.099
it's painful, but not lethal,

01:02:09.224 --> 01:02:12.599
You give me
answers and I'll stop,

01:02:12.974 --> 01:02:16.349
you hesitate or lie and
I will hurt you

01:02:18.974 --> 01:02:21.558
It's Steiner, he
wants the girl,

01:02:22.683 --> 01:02:24.933
he's been hunting her for years.

01:02:25.516 --> 01:02:26.474
Continue.

01:02:27.391 --> 01:02:29.349
Okay... fuck man!

01:02:29.432 --> 01:02:31.224
Fuck!

01:02:33.057 --> 01:02:35.224
Steiner is involved
with the one of

01:02:35.307 --> 01:02:37.933
the largest pharmaceuticals
in the UK,

01:02:38.349 --> 01:02:40.850
they're searching a vaccine
for a new virus,

01:02:41.266 --> 01:02:44.224
there are billions
of dollar at stake!

01:02:44.974 --> 01:02:46.933
it's way too big for you,

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:50.724
you they want to
create a huge pandemic

01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:53.391
and make billions
with a vaccine,

01:02:53.766 --> 01:02:55.349
They
won't stop there!

01:02:55.432 --> 01:02:58.349
What I know, is that
there's mostly an epidemic of

01:02:58.432 --> 01:03:00.015
motherfuckers like you,

01:03:00.099 --> 01:03:01.974
now tell me where she is.

01:03:03.266 --> 01:03:05.307
If you don't tell me
where I'll find her,

01:03:05.432 --> 01:03:09.099
I will hurt you,
I know how to do that

01:03:09.224 --> 01:03:13.933
it's my job, there are
128 ways to make your

01:03:14.057 --> 01:03:17.224
neurological system react
and I know them all.

01:03:21.432 --> 01:03:24.266
She... she took the
bus to the South,

01:03:24.974 --> 01:03:27.599
near Burmese border,
back to her roots!

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:29.516
But Steiner will get
there before you.

01:03:29.599 --> 01:03:33.182
Why did you kill
the children in my church?

01:03:33.266 --> 01:03:35.432
It wasn't me,
it was STEINER!

01:03:36.266 --> 01:03:37.432
Shit!

01:03:38.432 --> 01:03:40.766
Please!
Tell your friends that I will

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.516
kill all those who hurt her,

01:03:42.599 --> 01:03:45.057
and all those who killed
the children in my church.

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:47.140
their friends, their
friends friends,

01:03:47.266 --> 01:03:51.432
I will kill them all,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

01:03:53.057 --> 01:03:55.057
I understand I understand.

01:04:51.724 --> 01:04:53.099
You got good news for me?

01:04:53.224 --> 01:04:56.850
Are you kidding me? That
fucking nun came to my office,

01:04:57.766 --> 01:05:01.432
she shot all my men
and she shot me!

01:05:01.558 --> 01:05:03.516
Who the hell is she?

01:05:03.599 --> 01:05:06.391
it's a total graveyard here.

01:05:06.808 --> 01:05:08.140
Listen you're not
dead so I don't

01:05:08.266 --> 01:05:09.891
want to hear your
fucking bitching,

01:05:09.974 --> 01:05:11.224
tell me about the girl.

01:05:11.307 --> 01:05:13.891
You didn't quite understand
what I just said,

01:05:13.974 --> 01:05:17.349
she wants to kill us and you too

01:05:17.432 --> 01:05:18.974
and your associates.

01:05:19.099 --> 01:05:22.099
I'm not worried about the nun,
I'll take care of her later

01:05:22.224 --> 01:05:23.933
Where is the fucking girl?

01:05:24.015 --> 01:05:27.432
She had just reached a
small mission at Prachuap.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:29.724
You're sure about that?

01:05:29.808 --> 01:05:31.266
I'm fucking sure!

01:05:32.516 --> 01:05:33.724
You asshole!

01:05:41.558 --> 01:05:42.474
Yeah?
Tell me when you left

01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:47.974
Dying!
More like dead.

01:05:48.099 --> 01:05:50.641
Made Pontius Pilate proud sir.

01:05:50.766 --> 01:05:52.432
Is that right...

01:05:52.558 --> 01:05:54.766
well guess what, she's alive
and well and she just

01:05:54.891 --> 01:05:57.015
wiped out half of
Nop's fucking crew!...

01:05:57.099 --> 01:05:58.432
It's impossible.
... and she may be

01:05:58.516 --> 01:06:00.224
coming for us next!
Let her come I'm ready.

01:06:00.307 --> 01:06:04.015
Yeah I am, we'll fucking
take her down sir!

01:06:04.099 --> 01:06:07.599
Shut up! both of
you, I'll take care of it!

01:06:07.683 --> 01:06:09.474
You fucking people!

01:06:10.307 --> 01:06:11.558
WHY!

01:06:56.266 --> 01:06:57.850
Captain Keo.

01:06:57.933 --> 01:07:02.099
Ominous music continues]

01:07:03.516 --> 01:07:04.808
I heard you can organize an

01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:06.432
exfiltration for us.

01:07:09.099 --> 01:07:13.432
That's possible...
but not from Thailand,

01:07:13.558 --> 01:07:15.224
I have to cross the border,

01:07:16.224 --> 01:07:17.766
I don't feel like
having the Thai

01:07:17.891 --> 01:07:18.933
Army fucking
me in the ass.

01:07:19.015 --> 01:07:20.432
Neither would I.

01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:23.933
Where then?

01:07:31.766 --> 01:07:34.850
Here, in two days.

01:07:36.766 --> 01:07:38.933
What kind of cash
are you talking about?

01:07:39.307 --> 01:07:41.766
Plenty and if
you're interested in

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:43.891
making some side cash,

01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:46.683
I've got this sexy ball breaker

01:07:46.766 --> 01:07:49.099
with a tight little ass,

01:07:49.933 --> 01:07:52.266
that I'd like you to send
straight to hell for me.

01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.307
I'm in.

01:08:39.099 --> 01:08:41.057
GARR!

01:08:59.516 --> 01:09:02.808
Excellent work Sunee,
Nop will be pleased,

01:09:02.933 --> 01:09:04.307
you can go.

01:09:06.099 --> 01:09:09.474
May Lee, how are
you my old friend?

01:09:09.891 --> 01:09:14.432
you remember
me... Uncle Steiner?

01:09:14.516 --> 01:09:15.933
How could you forget.

01:09:17.558 --> 01:09:20.266
Look at you now, all grown up,

01:09:20.349 --> 01:09:23.432
I must say you were a
difficult one to track down.

01:09:24.766 --> 01:09:26.850
Do you know how
many men died

01:09:26.933 --> 01:09:28.891
trying to find you.

01:09:29.766 --> 01:09:31.599
Get a blood sample.

01:09:57.474 --> 01:10:00.474
So, you're the fucking nun,

01:10:00.599 --> 01:10:03.307
Everyone's so pissed off about!

01:10:06.432 --> 01:10:09.099
Don't bother talking,

01:10:09.599 --> 01:10:11.933
I have nothing to ask,

01:10:13.224 --> 01:10:16.683
I'm paid to kill you
and you going to fucking die.

01:10:16.766 --> 01:10:18.182
that's it.

01:10:18.266 --> 01:10:19.933
that's enough!
So it's true,

01:10:20.057 --> 01:10:22.140
what people say, Burmese
are only good at

01:10:22.266 --> 01:10:24.599
killing women and children!

01:10:24.724 --> 01:10:27.391
You want to play?
Play mommy and daddy.

01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:31.516
Hand me the goddamn granade!

01:10:42.432 --> 01:10:46.224
Usually in our culture,
women stay home,

01:10:46.307 --> 01:10:49.850
get laaid every night,
hoping to bear sons...

01:10:50.850 --> 01:10:54.224
but maybe your God
want to test you

01:10:54.307 --> 01:10:57.349
I will give you
your fucking chance,

01:10:58.766 --> 01:11:00.766
either you fuck
all my men and you

01:11:00.891 --> 01:11:04.850
die from ecstacy, or you
play a little game

01:11:04.933 --> 01:11:07.558
with us and you die anyway.

01:11:08.766 --> 01:11:10.349
I love games.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:11.516
Huh! Okay

01:11:11.599 --> 01:11:13.266
lets play.

01:11:13.349 --> 01:11:18.808
Each one of you has a granade
attached on his body,

01:11:19.182 --> 01:11:22.140
the first one who pull
the pin out from his

01:11:22.266 --> 01:11:23.766
opponent win.

01:11:31.724 --> 01:11:33.349
You don't seem to
understand the game,

01:11:33.432 --> 01:11:36.140
the point to place
the granade out of

01:11:36.266 --> 01:11:38.224
the reach of your opponent.

01:11:39.266 --> 01:11:40.808
When do we start?

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:43.850
Now.

01:12:43.516 --> 01:12:45.641
Ka-boom!

01:13:07.432 --> 01:13:08.766
Tell your men to back off!

01:13:12.432 --> 01:13:13.599
Come on!

01:13:32.766 --> 01:13:36.307
That fucking whistle.

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:15.891
Mr Steiner?
it's her! it's a match.

01:14:18.266 --> 01:14:19.307
Yes!

01:14:20.266 --> 01:14:21.516
YES!

01:14:23.641 --> 01:14:26.224
Sebie, Sebie come...

01:14:28.266 --> 01:14:31.099
what happened with Vassilief?

01:14:32.057 --> 01:14:33.850
why did you kill him?

01:14:36.766 --> 01:14:38.766
His whistling got
to my head sir.

01:14:45.266 --> 01:14:46.391
You're sick...

01:14:49.766 --> 01:14:50.724
...I love it.

01:14:53.266 --> 01:14:54.432
Yeah.

01:15:03.974 --> 01:15:06.391
I've got some really,

01:15:06.474 --> 01:15:07.891
really...

01:15:08.516 --> 01:15:10.349
good news for you!

01:15:12.349 --> 01:15:16.140
Keo
for Steiner...Keo for Steiner...

01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:17.307
Stop!

01:15:17.683 --> 01:15:19.432
Stop the car!

01:15:24.266 --> 01:15:25.307
Listening.

01:15:25.432 --> 01:15:28.432
Steiner wants to know
if everything is okay,

01:15:28.558 --> 01:15:30.224
did you catch the bitch?

01:15:30.933 --> 01:15:32.516
Mission completed.

01:15:33.850 --> 01:15:34.974
Good.

01:15:36.432 --> 01:15:38.432
Steiner wants her head.

01:15:38.516 --> 01:15:39.599
Copy that.

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:45.307
Bye-bye blonde.

01:16:24.933 --> 01:16:27.516
I'm sorry, I know I
shouldn't get used to it.

01:16:27.933 --> 01:16:29.891
What are you doing?
I have done all

01:16:29.974 --> 01:16:32.307
you asked me to fucking do!

01:16:32.432 --> 01:16:34.933
Tighten your thighs and

01:16:35.015 --> 01:16:37.766
shut the fuck up!

01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:39.391
You cannot do this to me!

01:16:39.474 --> 01:16:40.724
You fucking nun!

01:16:40.808 --> 01:16:43.683
..... go to Hell!

01:16:46.099 --> 01:16:48.432
Don't move, I'll be right back.

01:17:19.099 --> 01:17:21.266
Hey my little angel.

01:17:28.558 --> 01:17:30.891
Bang!

01:17:30.974 --> 01:17:32.850
Oops, he didn't make it.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:36.432
Come on, we have to go.

01:17:44.349 --> 01:17:45.808
Shit.. May Lee !

01:17:47.099 --> 01:17:48.140
Check out my girl!

01:17:48.266 --> 01:17:51.307
You bring me that bitch nun!

01:17:51.432 --> 01:17:53.766
... now!

01:17:59.766 --> 01:18:02.140
That fucking nun!

01:18:09.224 --> 01:18:10.140
Stop...

01:18:10.266 --> 01:18:11.474
don't move.

01:18:48.516 --> 01:18:49.474
Okay!

01:19:11.641 --> 01:19:14.850
A mute... and a nun...

01:19:14.933 --> 01:19:17.516
and you let them get away.

01:19:17.599 --> 01:19:19.808
What the hell is
wrong with you?

01:19:19.933 --> 01:19:21.974
What! she killed Keo!

01:19:22.099 --> 01:19:24.432
Nop said I could trust you.

01:19:24.558 --> 01:19:28.307
She not fucking nun,
what aren't you telling us!

01:19:41.057 --> 01:19:42.891
Any
more questions huh?

01:19:43.766 --> 01:19:44.766
ANYBODY?

01:19:51.933 --> 01:19:54.349
What!
Nop sir!

01:19:58.933 --> 01:20:01.599
What do you want?
How's the everything going?

01:20:02.266 --> 01:20:05.724
Well we're down a few men,
we're going to

01:20:05.808 --> 01:20:08.391
need some backup
as soon as possible.

01:20:08.474 --> 01:20:09.808
Keo?

01:20:09.933 --> 01:20:12.432
Keo..

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:13.808
well...

01:20:14.599 --> 01:20:16.182
he's reincarnated.

01:20:18.224 --> 01:20:19.182
The nun?

01:20:20.099 --> 01:20:21.099
Yeah!

01:20:22.224 --> 01:20:24.724
She's a fucking
killing machine.

01:20:25.266 --> 01:20:27.974
And she is the
fucking ghost too.

01:20:28.933 --> 01:20:30.015
What do you mean?

01:20:30.099 --> 01:20:32.349
By my contact at
immigration in Bangkok,

01:20:32.432 --> 01:20:35.432
they have nothing on her,
like you say...

01:20:35.558 --> 01:20:36.724
a ghost!

01:20:37.224 --> 01:20:39.599
Even her fingerprints
are not listed anywhere.

01:20:39.683 --> 01:20:41.683
You know her Mr Steiner?

01:20:42.432 --> 01:20:44.182
Looks like my past is
coming back to bite

01:20:44.266 --> 01:20:45.516
us in the ass.

01:20:45.599 --> 01:20:46.558
Steiner...

01:20:46.641 --> 01:20:48.057
you there?
Yeah I'm here,

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.766
I'm here, listen,
we're going to

01:20:49.850 --> 01:20:51.432
need helicopters
and more men.

01:20:51.850 --> 01:20:53.307
We're never going
to catch them by car.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:55.974
What? how the hell am
I supposed to come up

01:20:56.099 --> 01:20:57.349
with helicopter?
That's your job you

01:20:57.432 --> 01:21:00.266
figure it out, use your
Burmese contacts,

01:21:00.349 --> 01:21:02.891
and my brother I want
to talk to him now!

01:21:02.974 --> 01:21:04.224
Fuck!

01:21:04.307 --> 01:21:05.391
STEINER!

01:21:06.266 --> 01:21:08.850
Fucking asshole!

01:21:45.182 --> 01:21:46.724
Fucking incompetance!

01:21:50.266 --> 01:21:51.224
What?

01:21:55.683 --> 01:21:57.307
What Sunni?

01:21:57.432 --> 01:22:00.140
Maybe I can help you.

01:22:01.015 --> 01:22:02.266
Is that right?

01:22:06.891 --> 01:22:08.432
How you going
to do that huh?

01:22:09.933 --> 01:22:11.307
I'm listening.

01:22:12.766 --> 01:22:15.099
When I was on the
bus with her,

01:22:15.224 --> 01:22:18.933
she carried old photograph
with her like a treasure,

01:22:19.057 --> 01:22:21.307
I think it's her village,

01:22:21.432 --> 01:22:24.599
I had a feeling that she
wanted to go back

01:22:25.266 --> 01:22:27.558
I remember the
name of the village,

01:22:27.974 --> 01:22:29.307
it's near Ban Ploy.

01:22:31.516 --> 01:22:33.224
Well look at you,

01:22:35.266 --> 01:22:37.516
you beauty and
some brains too huh!

01:22:42.266 --> 01:22:45.266
What were you doing
in Bangkok huh Sunni?

01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:50.266
I used to manage
girls.

01:22:50.391 --> 01:22:52.266
Is that right.

01:23:07.432 --> 01:23:08.474
May Lee?

01:23:19.766 --> 01:23:21.432
I was not born this way...

01:23:23.933 --> 01:23:26.099
...I never asked for anything

01:23:29.474 --> 01:23:31.933
I was programmed,

01:23:32.933 --> 01:23:34.724
I wanted to change,

01:23:37.516 --> 01:23:39.474
to help others to...

01:23:39.599 --> 01:23:42.266
change the world somehow,

01:23:46.099 --> 01:23:48.266
I want to protect you,

01:23:50.599 --> 01:23:52.224
to protect children,

01:23:53.432 --> 01:23:54.432
to...

01:23:57.766 --> 01:23:59.683
the children I
will never bear,

01:24:04.015 --> 01:24:05.391
but sometimes

01:24:06.766 --> 01:24:12.182
words are not enough
and only strength

01:24:12.266 --> 01:24:15.099
has the power to change
the course of destiny,

01:24:15.599 --> 01:24:19.015
maybe God never forgives

01:24:20.266 --> 01:24:21.224
and...

01:24:25.974 --> 01:24:28.057
and my hell is
on this Earth,

01:24:50.766 --> 01:24:52.349
I don't know if...

01:24:52.432 --> 01:24:56.558
your blood is as special
as they seem to think,

01:24:58.099 --> 01:25:00.432
but to me you
are special...

01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:05.015
and I will never,
let them hurt you

01:25:05.974 --> 01:25:08.266
you're like me
when I was a child.

01:26:02.099 --> 01:26:02.933
Steiner?

01:26:03.057 --> 01:26:05.307
Affirm.
You bring backup?

01:26:05.432 --> 01:26:06.891
I brought 10 men here.

01:26:06.974 --> 01:26:10.057
Excellent... let's roll.

01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:13.933
Last round.
What about Sunni?

01:26:15.266 --> 01:26:16.558
She's gone.

01:27:03.432 --> 01:27:04.724
Don't move!

01:27:10.099 --> 01:27:12.307
Don't worry everything's
going to be fine,

01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:15.516
trust me,

01:27:15.599 --> 01:27:18.724
everything is going to be okay.

01:27:45.266 --> 01:27:46.558
Hello Gina...

01:27:49.808 --> 01:27:54.933
finally our paths cross again.

01:28:03.391 --> 01:28:06.349
Caged like the wild
animal you are,

01:28:09.933 --> 01:28:11.391
Where's May Lee?

01:28:11.850 --> 01:28:14.224
That's no longer
your concern,

01:28:15.432 --> 01:28:17.974
you've given us quite
a bit of trouble Gina baby.

01:28:18.099 --> 01:28:20.974
but I got to admit,
I'm impressed,

01:28:22.933 --> 01:28:25.057
you haven't lost
your killer instinct.

01:28:25.140 --> 01:28:28.266
Nobody calls me that anymore.

01:28:28.349 --> 01:28:29.683
Is that right...

01:28:30.266 --> 01:28:33.307
you know life...
life is funny,

01:28:33.432 --> 01:28:36.766
you disappear on me
and years later I

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:38.015
track you down all the way

01:28:38.099 --> 01:28:39.599
on the other side of the planet.

01:28:42.808 --> 01:28:44.349
Did you think you could just

01:28:44.432 --> 01:28:45.933
erase your past? huh?

01:28:47.808 --> 01:28:49.307
Just...

01:28:49.432 --> 01:28:51.266
reinvent yourself?

01:28:55.432 --> 01:28:57.057
What triggered you Gina?

01:28:58.516 --> 01:29:00.307
What was it that...

01:29:01.766 --> 01:29:03.266
made you go rogue?

01:29:04.766 --> 01:29:06.266
was it when you gunned down the

01:29:06.391 --> 01:29:07.558
Guzman family?

01:29:07.641 --> 01:29:08.850
You have the wrong target

01:29:08.933 --> 01:29:10.307
please let me explain.

01:29:10.432 --> 01:29:12.432
When you annihilated all of
them, including the

01:29:12.516 --> 01:29:13.516
little boy.

01:29:20.432 --> 01:29:25.599
It was a rotten
assignment, I killed

01:29:25.724 --> 01:29:28.099
innocent, for nothing.

01:29:28.224 --> 01:29:30.224
So that was your
cross to bear,

01:29:30.307 --> 01:29:31.266
the boy,

01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:34.724
That's why you took
May Lee in and

01:29:35.099 --> 01:29:38.391
raised her as your own,
disguised as a nun?

01:29:40.182 --> 01:29:42.015
You're a killing machine,
programmed

01:29:42.099 --> 01:29:44.766
to exterminate
nothing more.

01:29:47.266 --> 01:29:49.099
Back up...
back up!

01:29:51.349 --> 01:29:53.432
We traveled the world
to search for specimens

01:29:53.558 --> 01:29:54.974
like you, to carry out

01:29:55.099 --> 01:29:57.683
operations that,
governments

01:29:57.766 --> 01:29:59.850
didn't want to
be held accountable for.

01:30:02.432 --> 01:30:04.599
Your parents abandoned
you when you were

01:30:04.683 --> 01:30:06.891
just a child, you
were the precise

01:30:06.974 --> 01:30:08.766
prototype we
were looking for,

01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:11.015
Sir yes sir!

01:30:11.099 --> 01:30:12.641
After that it was
just a matter of...

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.766
training and
programming,

01:30:15.891 --> 01:30:17.850
giving you your
freedom back.

01:30:20.432 --> 01:30:21.766
And Gina...

01:30:24.933 --> 01:30:26.140
I'll miss you.

01:30:36.015 --> 01:30:37.766
I took you in,

01:30:39.391 --> 01:30:40.933
I protected you

01:30:41.683 --> 01:30:43.432
like you were
my daughter.

01:30:50.974 --> 01:30:55.099
You are not my father,

01:30:57.099 --> 01:31:00.099
you robbed me of my life.

01:31:04.766 --> 01:31:06.599
I sent you to kill Guzman,

01:31:06.683 --> 01:31:10.266
it was me, once I
knew that prick

01:31:10.391 --> 01:31:12.933
was going to testify
against us and they

01:31:13.015 --> 01:31:14.933
put him in witness
protection in Mexico

01:31:15.057 --> 01:31:17.307
I knew you were the
only choice for the

01:31:17.432 --> 01:31:18.432
assignment,

01:31:18.558 --> 01:31:19.683
and I knew you
would obey in

01:31:19.766 --> 01:31:20.766
the blink of an eye.

01:31:26.266 --> 01:31:27.432
I gave the order,

01:31:28.599 --> 01:31:29.558
I lied to you

01:31:31.558 --> 01:31:33.015
now here we are.

01:31:33.099 --> 01:31:37.057
Kill me.... but let her go.

01:31:39.182 --> 01:31:41.224
We're going to kill
you all right,

01:31:41.808 --> 01:31:43.224
with the girl,

01:31:44.015 --> 01:31:45.432
she's going to
become our little

01:31:45.558 --> 01:31:46.850
lab rat, so we
can study the

01:31:46.933 --> 01:31:48.808
properties in her blood,

01:31:51.266 --> 01:31:52.766
but I don't want you to think

01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:55.099
you're going to
die in vain Gina baby,

01:31:55.224 --> 01:31:56.307
oh no,

01:31:56.432 --> 01:31:59.432
we're all going to
get very very rich...

01:31:59.516 --> 01:32:00.516
NO!

01:32:00.599 --> 01:32:02.432
Thanks to our
little guinea pig.

01:32:02.558 --> 01:32:05.224
NO!

01:32:07.933 --> 01:32:09.307
Get the girl.

01:32:09.432 --> 01:32:12.391
Bring the girl in quick.

01:32:25.516 --> 01:32:27.599
May Lee...

01:32:28.224 --> 01:32:32.307
I wanted you to see
that miracles don't exist,

01:32:32.432 --> 01:32:36.432
like your father and
your grandfather

01:32:38.891 --> 01:32:41.391
I'm afraid she's
going to die too.

01:32:52.766 --> 01:32:54.391
You can talk?

01:32:57.266 --> 01:32:58.850
she can talk?

01:33:02.974 --> 01:33:04.974
Well that's what I call
some pretty

01:33:05.099 --> 01:33:07.474
goddamn good therapy.

01:33:11.099 --> 01:33:12.266
So?

01:33:13.266 --> 01:33:14.224
Dead.

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:22.558
You
bastard!

01:33:23.099 --> 01:33:28.015
God will punish you!

01:33:29.182 --> 01:33:32.808
Well if Gina here
couldn't get the job done,

01:33:33.891 --> 01:33:36.599
I don't think God
stands much of a chance.

01:33:36.933 --> 01:33:40.182
What do we do with her body sir?

01:33:42.474 --> 01:33:44.266
Let her rot...

01:33:44.766 --> 01:33:46.933
like a dog,

01:33:48.850 --> 01:33:52.099
we leave tomorrow,
at 0600, you understand?

01:34:25.432 --> 01:34:27.432
I come to free you Gina,

01:34:28.391 --> 01:34:31.224
I'm here with a few
Thai commandos,

01:34:32.474 --> 01:34:35.099
Gina listen to me, I fed up

01:34:35.182 --> 01:34:37.766
being with the wrong
side, the bad guys

01:34:37.891 --> 01:34:41.558
and I more try to
be a Steiner slave,

01:34:41.641 --> 01:34:45.057
can I find redemption Gina?

01:34:45.724 --> 01:34:47.140
Can I?

01:35:05.015 --> 01:35:08.432
High speed bullet and
the artery would have...

01:35:11.599 --> 01:35:13.432
besides he kill my brother,

01:35:14.766 --> 01:35:17.558
we'll take care of
the Burmese Gina,

01:35:18.766 --> 01:35:22.683
you do what you
have to do, okay?

01:35:39.432 --> 01:35:44.266
So you
didn't abandon me!

01:35:57.974 --> 01:35:59.891
Forget about it!

01:36:00.432 --> 01:36:05.766
Don't you get it,
Steiner is using you,

01:36:05.850 --> 01:36:08.516
just like he used me,
and so many others

01:36:08.599 --> 01:36:09.933
before us...

01:36:10.057 --> 01:36:12.266
we are
nothing to him,

01:36:14.432 --> 01:36:16.099
do you understand?

01:36:17.558 --> 01:36:19.432
he's using us.

01:36:20.391 --> 01:36:22.266
Speak for yourself,
he loves me

01:36:22.349 --> 01:36:23.474
like a daughter!

01:36:23.599 --> 01:36:27.474
You fool... you're
so ignorant.

01:36:27.599 --> 01:36:31.724
Don't talk to me... like...

01:36:31.808 --> 01:36:33.099
that!

01:37:30.808 --> 01:37:32.391
But I saw you die!

01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:37.974
So wonderful
to hear your voice!

01:37:38.808 --> 01:37:40.432
Oh my God!

01:37:48.432 --> 01:37:50.099
You saved me!

01:37:54.516 --> 01:37:55.474
No.

01:37:57.015 --> 01:37:58.933
God saved you.

01:38:03.933 --> 01:38:06.057
Run! run to
the forest!

01:39:15.641 --> 01:39:18.474
Hey.... stop!

01:39:31.724 --> 01:39:32.891
Let's go!

01:39:37.391 --> 01:39:39.057
Steiner!

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:42.432
I'm taking her with
me you understand!

01:39:45.140 --> 01:39:47.432
You are not going
anywhere with her

01:39:47.558 --> 01:39:49.015
and you are not going to hurt

01:39:49.099 --> 01:39:52.933
anyone ever again.
Leave her or I will

01:39:53.015 --> 01:39:55.140
kill you.
I made you...

01:39:56.641 --> 01:39:58.516
you could never kill me.

01:39:58.599 --> 01:40:00.391
It's over Steiner!

01:40:01.099 --> 01:40:04.099
I decide when it's over.

01:40:04.182 --> 01:40:07.432
Not...any...more.

01:40:16.099 --> 01:40:17.641
Shit... fucking bitch!

01:40:21.974 --> 01:40:23.391
FUCK YOU!

01:40:26.099 --> 01:40:28.182
In the name of the Father...

01:40:29.933 --> 01:40:31.432
the son...

01:40:34.391 --> 01:40:37.266
and the...
HOLY SPIRIT!

01:41:34.724 --> 01:41:36.015
Hello how can I help you?

01:41:36.099 --> 01:41:37.641
We'd like to see a hematologist.

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:46.349
A few days ago the World

01:41:46.432 --> 01:41:48.641
Health Organization
announced a major

01:41:48.766 --> 01:41:50.140
Discovery in the
fight against the

01:41:50.266 --> 01:41:51.724
epidemics that have
been hitting our

01:41:51.808 --> 01:41:53.266
planet for months,

01:41:53.391 --> 01:41:55.432
perhaps a beacon
of hope for thousands

01:42:00.599 --> 01:42:01.558
Hello?

01:42:03.599 --> 01:42:06.516
We know you
ordered Guzman operation.

01:42:11.766 --> 01:42:12.933
Who is it?

01:42:13.558 --> 01:42:15.266
Repentant.
