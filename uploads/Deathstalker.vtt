WEBVTT

03:04.852 --> 03:06.721
Oh, oh, wow.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.895
No. No.

03:53.735 --> 03:55.536
No.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.205
You must re...

03:58.573 --> 04:00.307
You must return it.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.102
Another defeat.

05:01.936 --> 05:04.806
What's the use of
Abraxeon seizing my crops

05:04.939 --> 05:06.339
to feed their soldiers

05:06.473 --> 05:08.341
if they're going to continue
to lose ground?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.011
Pretty soon
there's not going to be

05:10.144 --> 05:11.779
nothing left for them
to protect.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.682
How are my children
supposed to survive the winter

05:14.816 --> 05:17.018
with nothing but scraps to eat?

05:17.151 --> 05:18.820
They've already eaten
all my good boots.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.957
Hey!

05:23.090 --> 05:25.458
That weren't meant
to be a jape!

05:29.864 --> 05:33.366
At this point, we might as well
join the scavengers.

05:34.268 --> 05:37.238
Oi! They're the only ones
profiting from all this.

05:37.370 --> 05:41.309
Picking through the corpses
like vultures.

05:42.610 --> 05:45.713
Oh, here comes one now.

05:47.849 --> 05:50.017
Look at this handsome specimen.

05:50.151 --> 05:51.719
He'd strip us bare

05:51.853 --> 05:54.421
before our bodies were even
cold, he would.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.356
Makes me sick.

05:56.489 --> 05:59.894
Oi!

06:01.162 --> 06:03.064
There's not a one among us

06:03.197 --> 06:05.533
who's stared into hell
the way he has.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.034
Leave him be.

06:07.168 --> 06:10.872
Aye. Who is he, then?

06:14.175 --> 06:17.845
I don't pretend to know
his whole past.

06:17.979 --> 06:21.515
They say he was once
a knight in the Queen's army.

06:21.649 --> 06:25.452
The old queen,
before Halgan's ascension.

06:25.586 --> 06:29.223
Before the war against
the Dreadites.

06:30.758 --> 06:34.028
Surgeon with a sword.

06:34.161 --> 06:36.097
That's what's been sung.

06:36.230 --> 06:40.201
And a survivor of the massacre
by Grimvault.

06:41.836 --> 06:43.704
What?

06:43.838 --> 06:46.207
I was told no one survived
that cursed night--

06:46.340 --> 06:48.209
Aye, not a soul.

06:48.342 --> 06:49.944
Yet there he is.

06:50.845 --> 06:52.647
At least his body.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.783
Who knows
what remains of his spirit

06:55.917 --> 06:59.419
as he wanders this realm alone?

06:59.887 --> 07:02.723
No allegiances, no banner.

07:02.857 --> 07:05.826
Few even know his name.

07:06.227 --> 07:09.130
Only the one he answers to.

07:10.965 --> 07:12.767
What name would that be?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.842
They call him--

07:21.976 --> 07:23.945
Deathstalker!

07:44.932 --> 07:46.434
You know why we've come.

07:46.567 --> 07:49.103
Halgan's amulet.
Hand it over!

07:51.072 --> 07:52.974
-Never met him.
-He's lying.

07:53.107 --> 07:54.675
We should eat his legs.

07:54.809 --> 07:58.179
That will make him nice
and honest.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.613
We're hungry, aren't we?

07:59.747 --> 08:01.215
I could eat.

08:05.453 --> 08:07.455
For my food and drink.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.300
And this is for the chair.

08:19.433 --> 08:20.735
What...?

08:23.337 --> 08:24.638
Oh, wow.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.343
You can't run from us!

08:31.879 --> 08:34.382
Show yourself, fool.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.091
Sneaky little bug!

08:47.795 --> 08:50.564
Let me have the first bite,
brother.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.200
Two against one.

08:53.334 --> 08:54.869
Not very fair.

09:02.143 --> 09:03.544
Why are we doing this dance?

09:03.677 --> 09:05.046
Master wants the amulet.

09:05.179 --> 09:06.747
And you, dead!

09:17.258 --> 09:18.893
Oh, I hate trolls.

09:20.027 --> 09:21.695
I'm outta here.

09:29.370 --> 09:31.205
Oh, you're
gonna make us work

09:31.338 --> 09:33.607
for our meal, aren't you,
little man?

09:33.741 --> 09:35.910
I want his brains!

09:36.043 --> 09:38.379
You can have them
You need them.

09:42.616 --> 09:43.918
This is what you want?

09:44.519 --> 09:47.154
-The amulet!
-Hand it over!

09:59.767 --> 10:01.802
Go ahead and run,
you fool!

10:01.936 --> 10:04.238
Every assassin will
be after you!

10:04.371 --> 10:06.140
There's nowhere to hide!

10:06.273 --> 10:08.642
That's right!
Come back and fight me!

10:08.776 --> 10:10.244
I'll tear you to pieces!

10:10.377 --> 10:12.813
I'll scatter your brain to
every corner--

10:40.509 --> 10:42.143
Whoa.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.026
Good riddance.

11:10.004 --> 11:11.071
What?

11:41.503 --> 11:43.337
God, it stinks.

11:49.678 --> 11:50.878
I know it stinks.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.413
Calm down.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.782
That's nasty.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.353
Whoa.

12:08.429 --> 12:09.564
Hello?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.910
Ah, Deathstalker.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.715
What terrible curse

12:26.847 --> 12:29.450
has befallen you this time?

12:30.284 --> 12:31.819
This.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.493
I can feel it is bound to you.

12:39.628 --> 12:41.929
I noticed. Now unbound it.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.599
This flavor of enchantment
means it can only

12:44.733 --> 12:48.836
be passed on with the death
of the one who carries it.

12:49.803 --> 12:53.575
Well, do these runes mention
any exceptions to that rule?

12:53.708 --> 12:56.243
They are
beyond my understanding.

12:56.377 --> 12:58.479
So I'm stuck with this guy?

12:58.613 --> 13:00.814
I said they are
beyond my understanding,

13:00.948 --> 13:03.685
not that they cannot
be understood.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.588
Map.

13:13.394 --> 13:15.162
A symbol.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.970
And now the offering.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.648
Nice.

13:51.432 --> 13:53.568
There is a man
who might have

13:53.702 --> 13:55.537
the answers you seek.

13:55.670 --> 13:58.839
That is, if he still lives.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.374
His name is Daedelad,

14:00.508 --> 14:02.711
a member
of the Order of Troxartas.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.580
One of the few mages
left in Abraxeon

14:05.714 --> 14:09.917
who still carries a passion
for the ancient tongue.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.486
Well, where
do I find this wizard?

14:12.620 --> 14:15.322
Patience, child.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.407
Aw, great.

14:33.541 --> 14:36.845
Not the destination
you were hoping for?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.912
Thanks for your help, Toralva.

14:39.581 --> 14:41.215
Something for your stew.

14:44.151 --> 14:47.254
Your offering
warns of danger.

14:47.388 --> 14:48.889
I'm sure it does.

14:56.497 --> 14:57.599
Your door's broken.

14:58.499 --> 15:03.103
The specters of your past are
calling in the darkness.

15:03.237 --> 15:05.072
I see a great evil

15:05.205 --> 15:08.442
on the horizon
of your fate!

15:08.576 --> 15:10.645
You cannot outrun it.

15:10.779 --> 15:15.115
Just once I would like to come
to this cursed place

15:15.249 --> 15:18.252
and not entertain
such rambling nonsense.

15:19.621 --> 15:22.456
But it is you who are cursed,

15:22.590 --> 15:26.393
Deathstalker!

15:34.101 --> 15:35.936
Whoa.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.940
Easy, Calibus.
Wait here, okay?

15:58.660 --> 16:00.294
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

16:00.427 --> 16:02.496
Calibus!

16:02.630 --> 16:04.164
Damn it!

16:59.521 --> 17:00.822
Holy crap.

17:01.856 --> 17:03.591
What happened here?

17:22.042 --> 17:24.378
I hope you cut
better than the last one.

17:25.813 --> 17:27.549
Someone there?

17:27.682 --> 17:30.050
Sit tight.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.386
Is somebody out there?

17:34.589 --> 17:35.790
Say something!

17:42.931 --> 17:44.298
Whoa.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.224
Oh, hello.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.463
What are you doing
down there?

18:17.932 --> 18:19.266
Oh, shit!

18:36.651 --> 18:39.621
Oh, at last. I'm free!

18:39.754 --> 18:40.989
Are you DaedeWad?

18:41.121 --> 18:44.092
Uh, yeah,
I'm Daedelad Parsaneon,

18:44.224 --> 18:46.126
son of Amax The Wise.

18:49.964 --> 18:51.666
But everyone calls me Doodad.

18:51.799 --> 18:53.835
Look, I hate to break it
to you, Doodad,

18:53.968 --> 18:55.503
we're in a bit of a bind here.

18:55.637 --> 18:57.972
Oh, serpents of Malinax.

18:58.106 --> 19:00.675
I warned those bumbling bandits
what they'd find

19:00.808 --> 19:02.543
if they ventured
too far into these caves.

19:02.677 --> 19:04.277
I have an idea.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.047
Hop on. Come on.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.019
What are you gonna do?

19:11.151 --> 19:12.520
Not die.

19:19.493 --> 19:20.862
Nice one!

19:20.995 --> 19:22.797
- Ooh!
- Oh...

19:26.934 --> 19:28.201
-Tuck and roll!
-What?

19:37.545 --> 19:39.379
Wait, wait!

19:41.516 --> 19:43.350
Hurrah! We're safe!

19:44.986 --> 19:46.420
Yeah. You're welcome.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.991
What do they call you, good sir?

19:50.124 --> 19:53.193
The name is Death--

19:56.798 --> 19:59.499
Hold still.

20:04.304 --> 20:05.606
Would you stop it?

20:06.674 --> 20:08.341
Okay.

20:10.178 --> 20:12.113
Hold still.
I was close that time.

20:12.245 --> 20:13.413
You were not.

20:21.989 --> 20:24.025
Okay, hey, hey.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.815
So you stole this
from Prince Halgan?

21:20.948 --> 21:23.017
Well, "stole" is a bit strong.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.451
He was already dead.

21:24.585 --> 21:27.255
Well...
on his way out, at least.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.457
-Meaning?
-He was coughing a bit.

21:30.591 --> 21:33.360
But it was definitely
a death rattle. I'm sure of it.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.696
-Sounds like he was alive to me.
-Hey!

21:35.830 --> 21:38.032
I didn't rescue you
to get a lecture on the ethics

21:38.166 --> 21:39.534
of the spoils of war.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.202
Now you keep it up,
and I throw you

21:41.334 --> 21:42.837
back in there
with those serpents.

21:45.773 --> 21:48.441
Well, I suppose
I do owe you my life.

21:49.744 --> 21:52.180
So I'll do what I can to solve
this little riddle.

21:54.314 --> 21:57.051
These runes alone
suggest powerful magic.

21:58.119 --> 22:01.388
But what purpose does it serve?

22:01.522 --> 22:02.489
Mmm!

22:02.623 --> 22:03.724
The runes.

22:03.858 --> 22:07.628
They're not Abraxeon,
they're Asmordian!

22:07.762 --> 22:09.197
Asmordian, huh?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.632
The precursor to the
Abraxeon empire.

22:11.766 --> 22:13.734
Very little record of
them has survived.

22:13.868 --> 22:16.170
Their language
all but forgotten.

22:17.004 --> 22:19.540
-Dead language, huh?
-Dead to everyone but

22:19.674 --> 22:22.977
a fellow member of the Sorcerers
Order, the great wizard Xodan.

22:23.978 --> 22:26.314
Skilled
in all the ancient tongues.

22:26.446 --> 22:29.183
-Hyperion, Atlantean--
-Wait, wait, wait.

22:29.317 --> 22:30.751
So you can't read it either?

22:32.485 --> 22:34.322
Crap.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.090
Where do we find this Xodan guy?

22:36.224 --> 22:38.092
In his crypt, I imagine.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.194
-He's dead?
-Very much so.

22:40.328 --> 22:42.063
But he would be entombed
with his scrolls,

22:42.196 --> 22:43.664
and I'm certain
that one of them

22:43.798 --> 22:45.266
will contain
the Asmordian cipher.

22:45.398 --> 22:47.068
And with that,
you can read the amulet

22:47.201 --> 22:48.401
and reverse the curse?

22:48.536 --> 22:50.538
-I believe so.
-Great.

22:50.671 --> 22:53.207
- We'll head out at sunrise.
- Oh, no.

22:53.341 --> 22:55.610
I can't go to Xodan's crypt.

22:55.743 --> 22:58.012
With so many assassins
in pursuit of the amulet,

22:58.145 --> 22:59.614
it's far too dangerous.

22:59.747 --> 23:01.448
You go there and get it

23:01.582 --> 23:04.051
and bring it back to me
at Munkar's Tavern.

23:04.185 --> 23:05.853
Hey, if it wasn't for me,

23:05.987 --> 23:08.256
you would still be locked
in a trunk.

23:08.388 --> 23:10.423
Besides, do
you really think

23:10.558 --> 23:11.893
you're going to last
out of here on your own?

23:14.996 --> 23:17.365
-Hmm?
-Eh...

23:19.600 --> 23:20.735
Fine.

23:20.868 --> 23:23.671
At dawn, we'll travel
to Xodan's Sanctuary.

23:24.437 --> 23:26.473
Now pass me some of that meat.

23:40.453 --> 23:41.589
I noticed something strange

23:41.722 --> 23:44.424
with the assassin I slayed
back at Munkar's Tavern.

23:44.558 --> 23:46.093
The marking on his shoulder.

23:46.227 --> 23:48.129
A guild marking,
perhaps.

23:48.262 --> 23:50.164
No,
this was something else.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.066
Maybe you know what it means.

23:57.805 --> 23:59.407
Something like this.

24:07.214 --> 24:09.917
That's not possible.

24:10.051 --> 24:12.186
The Sect of Sytor was wiped out
eons ago.

24:12.787 --> 24:14.055
Sytor?

24:14.188 --> 24:16.624
An ancient cult of sorcerers.

24:16.757 --> 24:19.627
Obsessed with the mysteries
of the Outer Realms.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.296
Worlds of dark evil
that no mortal

24:22.430 --> 24:24.598
was ever meant
to understand.

24:24.732 --> 24:26.434
Their leader, Nekromemnon.

24:26.567 --> 24:27.702
He was defeated,

24:27.835 --> 24:31.471
and all records of his teachings
were destroyed.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.041
Or so I thought.

24:34.175 --> 24:37.845
If the markings you saw
are from the Sect of Sytor,

24:37.979 --> 24:40.047
then there are more
sinister forces at work here.

24:40.181 --> 24:43.384
So you're saying the Sect of
Sytor has returned?

24:43.517 --> 24:46.520
That Nekromemnon is back to
finish what he started?

24:46.654 --> 24:47.722
Well, the Dreadites

24:47.855 --> 24:50.658
are rumored to have been
born from necromancy.

24:50.791 --> 24:52.960
But all I know for sure
is that

24:53.094 --> 24:55.196
if the Sect of Sytor
is involved,

24:55.329 --> 24:57.898
your quest is truly doomed.

25:06.207 --> 25:08.542
We should keep moving.
Hop on.

25:13.381 --> 25:14.849
All right.

25:35.569 --> 25:37.905
Someone approaches.
Hide!

25:58.559 --> 25:59.727
Where is he?

25:59.860 --> 26:01.762
Excellent.

26:01.896 --> 26:03.464
We've got him.

26:18.012 --> 26:19.313
He's here.

26:19.447 --> 26:20.881
Find him.

26:25.786 --> 26:28.122
Come on, let's go!

26:28.255 --> 26:29.423
After him!

26:38.533 --> 26:40.101
Hide behind those rocks.

26:59.787 --> 27:01.222
What are you doing?

27:01.355 --> 27:03.491
When it happens,
you'll thank me.

27:04.425 --> 27:06.360
When what happens?
Whoa!

27:08.996 --> 27:11.265
Go that way!

27:11.398 --> 27:12.867
No. That way!

27:14.603 --> 27:15.803
No, go the other way!

27:15.936 --> 27:18.272
How is this helping?
God damnit!

27:18.405 --> 27:20.307
-What is this?
-No, that way!

27:21.576 --> 27:22.810
Go!

27:31.152 --> 27:32.453
What is this? Hey, hey!

27:32.587 --> 27:34.255
-Stop. What is this?
-No!

27:34.388 --> 27:36.891
-No! No, no, no.
-God damnit! Stop!

27:37.024 --> 27:38.459
-Stop it!
-No!

27:39.293 --> 27:41.395
Stop. Stop it. Stop.

27:43.197 --> 27:45.499
- No, not--
- Pathetic.

28:09.957 --> 28:11.660
Jotak.

28:11.792 --> 28:13.360
Tritus.

28:13.494 --> 28:15.896
I gave up that name
long ago.

28:16.030 --> 28:17.532
Ah, yes.

28:17.666 --> 28:20.267
Deathstalker, is it not?

28:21.636 --> 28:24.104
I knew our paths
would cross again one day.

28:25.072 --> 28:27.708
Fortunately, your cowardice

28:27.841 --> 28:31.845
has set you on a path
back to me.

28:31.979 --> 28:33.747
You see, old friend,

28:33.881 --> 28:35.883
the ritual at Grimvault...

28:36.016 --> 28:38.185
<i>Tritus, Jotak.</i>

28:38.919 --> 28:41.789
Stop those warlocks!

28:45.660 --> 28:47.895
<i>The warlocks</i>
<i>we killed to protect</i>

28:48.028 --> 28:49.797
<i>the might of Abraxeon.</i>

28:49.930 --> 28:53.033
<i>That was the first step</i>
<i>in ensuring his resurrection.</i>

28:53.167 --> 28:56.737
You must resist
the dark enchantments.

29:10.050 --> 29:11.620
<i>My old friend.</i>

29:16.390 --> 29:19.126
Your blade should have ended me
that night.

29:19.260 --> 29:21.596
But what you failed
to realize is that

29:21.730 --> 29:25.299
my fate was in his hands,
not yours.

29:25.432 --> 29:28.936
<i>And now Nekromemnon</i>
<i>has returned.</i>

29:29.069 --> 29:31.506
<i>And this time,</i>
<i>he'll bring the entire world</i>

29:31.640 --> 29:33.575
<i>to its knees.</i>

29:35.577 --> 29:37.411
And I couldn't resist the chance

29:37.545 --> 29:40.615
to take Halgan's amulet
from you personally...

29:41.448 --> 29:43.450
Deathstalker.

29:44.653 --> 29:46.453
Then by all means.

29:52.126 --> 29:53.728
Come and get it.

29:54.428 --> 29:56.330
No!

29:57.464 --> 29:59.266
He's mine.

31:18.979 --> 31:20.682
Goodbye, my friend.

31:36.930 --> 31:39.400
Doodad, let's go! Come on!

31:39.534 --> 31:41.268
After him!

31:57.585 --> 31:59.821
What have you embroiled me in,
Deathstalker?

32:00.555 --> 32:03.257
-Hey!
-This is no mere curse reverse.

32:03.390 --> 32:05.058
If Nekromemnon has
truly returned

32:05.192 --> 32:06.728
from the outer realms, then

32:06.861 --> 32:08.929
Abraxeon
is on the brink of annihilation.

32:09.697 --> 32:12.466
We must decipher those runes,
and quickly.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.803
At this rate, we'll be lucky
if we survive the night.

32:14.935 --> 32:18.740
Survival may have set you
on this path, but I see it now.

32:18.873 --> 32:21.509
Our meeting
is the machinations of the gods.

32:22.109 --> 32:25.345
We have to learn what part
the amulet plays in this plot,

32:25.479 --> 32:26.748
or risk the end of everything

32:26.881 --> 32:29.784
and the beginning of a dark era
I dare not imagine.

32:31.985 --> 32:33.922
Machinations of the gods, huh?

32:36.925 --> 32:38.860
-I like that.
-Huh.

32:40.227 --> 32:42.931
Lead the way, little guy.
Come on, let's go.

33:10.758 --> 33:12.226
Nekromemnon's minions!

33:12.359 --> 33:13.628
On this sacred ground?

33:13.761 --> 33:15.162
Why?

33:15.964 --> 33:18.733
There's no way past those
Dreadites without being seen.

33:18.867 --> 33:22.069
Look. The Xodan scrolls
will be buried with him.

33:22.202 --> 33:24.506
And among them will be
the Asmordian translation.

33:24.639 --> 33:26.073
Oh, that translation is my

33:26.206 --> 33:28.242
my only chance
of deciphering the amulet.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.310
If I could just
get my hands on it.

33:30.444 --> 33:32.514
We have to find a way in there.

33:38.018 --> 33:39.219
I have an idea.

33:54.736 --> 33:55.837
Oh, wow.

33:55.970 --> 33:57.906
The acolytes of Kulthis.

33:58.038 --> 34:00.775
I should have known they played
a part in this madness.

34:00.909 --> 34:02.209
This was a bad idea.

34:02.342 --> 34:04.879
-This was your idea.
-Ugh.

34:05.013 --> 34:06.781
What is this?
This is gross!

34:06.915 --> 34:08.248
-Shh! Quiet!
-Hey!

34:08.382 --> 34:09.851
-They'll hear you. Shut up!
-You shut up.

34:09.984 --> 34:12.419
Maybe both of you
could shut up.

34:17.892 --> 34:20.028
You're not the only one
sneaking in.

34:20.160 --> 34:21.428
Okay?

34:22.730 --> 34:23.898
Could you shush?

34:24.032 --> 34:25.399
Please?

34:26.901 --> 34:28.201
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

34:29.837 --> 34:31.739
-Who are you?
-What is he doing?

34:34.374 --> 34:37.077
The ancient rite
of resurrection.

34:37.210 --> 34:38.713
A ritual that can only
be performed

34:38.846 --> 34:40.982
by those who share lineage

34:41.114 --> 34:43.718
with ageless beings
that rule the outer worlds.

35:20.588 --> 35:22.189
So this is
how he makes his army,

35:22.322 --> 35:24.458
by enslaving the corpses
of his enemies.

35:26.326 --> 35:28.696
Of all the graveyards
in all the realms.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.932
-Really, Doodad?
-Whine about it later.

35:31.498 --> 35:32.867
What's the plan here, guys?

35:34.267 --> 35:36.269
First of all, this is our plan,

35:36.403 --> 35:38.539
and it was working fine
before you showed up.

35:38.673 --> 35:39.974
And who the hell are you,
anyway?

35:40.108 --> 35:41.208
Who are you?
I don't know who you are.

35:41.341 --> 35:43.111
The path
to Xodan's crypt is clear.

35:43.243 --> 35:44.545
Now's my chance.

35:44.679 --> 35:46.114
Doodad!
Where are you going?

35:46.246 --> 35:48.683
Keep an eye on the acolytes.
I will return.

35:49.751 --> 35:52.053
That's some plan.

35:53.021 --> 35:54.822
-Wait for me.
-Hey!

35:56.256 --> 35:57.859
What the hell?

36:08.503 --> 36:09.704
Gross.

36:23.518 --> 36:24.919
There it is.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.539
- Help me!
- Just a sec.

37:01.455 --> 37:03.091
What are you after, exactly?

37:03.223 --> 37:06.293
A scroll that translates
the Asmordian tongue.

37:06.426 --> 37:07.895
One of these must be it.

37:08.029 --> 37:09.097
No!

37:10.397 --> 37:11.766
Hey, uh,

37:11.899 --> 37:13.101
I don't want to rush you,
little guy,

37:13.233 --> 37:14.769
but there's only one way
out of here,

37:14.902 --> 37:17.437
and if the freaks upstairs
catch on, we're done.

37:18.238 --> 37:20.708
It's here, I know it is!
I just need more time!

37:22.043 --> 37:24.045
Ah...Not it!

37:47.068 --> 37:48.435
No!

38:01.115 --> 38:02.315
We gotta go.

38:03.416 --> 38:04.986
I need more time!

38:10.290 --> 38:12.126
Ugh. Atlantean.

38:25.573 --> 38:27.108
Okay, you freak.

38:27.241 --> 38:29.277
Let's see what color you bleed.

39:38.679 --> 39:40.882
Well, did you find it?

39:41.015 --> 39:43.017
Just a sec. Hypernian...

39:45.485 --> 39:47.188
Come on, hurry!

39:47.321 --> 39:49.590
-Got it!
-Great, let's go. Come on.

39:56.831 --> 40:01.401
You are the one they call...

40:04.437 --> 40:06.707
Deathstalker.

40:18.252 --> 40:20.955
I will have...

40:23.624 --> 40:28.129
...what is mine.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.497
It's him.

40:31.365 --> 40:32.934
Nekromemnon.

40:35.102 --> 40:37.238
My emissaries

40:37.371 --> 40:39.073
will hunt you

40:39.206 --> 40:42.643
to the ends
of the realm and beyond.

40:42.777 --> 40:45.613
Run while you can.

40:45.746 --> 40:50.618
The further you take
the light of Talon from me,

40:50.751 --> 40:54.088
the greater
my wrath will grow.

40:54.221 --> 40:56.757
Light of Talon?

40:56.891 --> 40:59.360
Soon you will beg

40:59.492 --> 41:03.297
for the mercy of death!

41:12.239 --> 41:14.308
-Here.
-What?

41:23.684 --> 41:24.885
A way out.

41:25.987 --> 41:27.221
Let's go!

41:28.089 --> 41:29.623
Go, go, go!

41:43.104 --> 41:44.872
Come on, Doodad.

41:47.942 --> 41:49.643
-Uh, hi.
-Okay.

41:58.552 --> 42:00.354
They'll be all over
the main roads.

42:00.488 --> 42:02.823
We should wait till dawn
before we go any further.

42:04.225 --> 42:05.926
This looks like a fine spot.

42:06.060 --> 42:08.362
- What's that sound?
- Ah, don't worry.

42:08.496 --> 42:10.064
Those are just
the Wailing Woods.

42:10.197 --> 42:12.066
Nothing to be concerned about
and should help

42:12.199 --> 42:14.402
mask any noise
we might make in the night.

42:14.535 --> 42:16.037
Well, good.

42:16.170 --> 42:19.073
So nobody's going to complain
if I play a little bit of this.

42:28.349 --> 42:30.084
Hey.

42:30.818 --> 42:32.219
Thanks for your help
back there.

42:32.353 --> 42:34.021
I never got your name.

42:34.688 --> 42:36.257
It's Brisbayne,

42:36.390 --> 42:38.559
thief extraordinaire.

42:38.692 --> 42:39.960
Don't worry.

42:40.094 --> 42:42.897
I'm not going to steal
any of your precious scrolls.

42:44.065 --> 42:47.201
I prefer my treasures to have
a little more sparkle to them.

42:50.271 --> 42:51.972
Well, I'm not worried.

42:56.110 --> 42:57.578
All right, then.

42:57.711 --> 43:00.247
I'll let you know
when I need the amulet.

43:00.381 --> 43:01.982
Just rest.

43:40.955 --> 43:44.091
Hey, Doodad. Brisbayne.

44:22.363 --> 44:23.731
Show yourself.

44:48.155 --> 44:49.356
No!

45:29.763 --> 45:31.198
Aah!

46:28.757 --> 46:30.024
Huh, look at that.

46:32.993 --> 46:34.261
Just rubble.

46:36.463 --> 46:38.767
Let's go. Come on.

48:04.985 --> 48:07.054
This is but a taste

48:07.187 --> 48:09.223
of what was shared with me

48:09.356 --> 48:11.425
from within the abyss.

48:34.915 --> 48:37.752
The child will obey

48:37.886 --> 48:41.321
if you have the strength
to command it.

48:50.063 --> 48:51.800
Your work...

48:53.133 --> 48:55.603
...is not finished, Jotak.

48:57.605 --> 49:00.809
It is the will of Sytor

49:00.941 --> 49:02.677
himself.

49:04.111 --> 49:05.446
Yes.

49:05.580 --> 49:09.851
If I am to possess
the light of Talon,

49:09.983 --> 49:13.320
Deathstalker must die.

49:18.292 --> 49:21.495
Oh, yes!

49:37.177 --> 49:39.379
Your little friend
is a heavy sleeper.

49:39.514 --> 49:40.748
He's not my friend.

49:40.882 --> 49:43.984
I've enlisted him to
lift the curse, nothing more.

49:44.117 --> 49:46.788
Something to do with
that Asmordian amulet?

49:46.921 --> 49:49.056
Look, the talisman
is bound to me,

49:49.189 --> 49:50.725
and I'm looking to unbind it,

49:50.859 --> 49:53.628
and preferably
stay alive in the process.

49:53.761 --> 49:55.128
You really can't stand
the thought of anyone

49:55.262 --> 49:56.865
sticking by you, can you?

49:57.998 --> 49:59.968
You're an easy read,
Deathstalker.

50:01.101 --> 50:03.070
The world is full of people
like you, I get it.

50:03.203 --> 50:05.874
Life is much simpler
when you live for one destiny.

50:06.006 --> 50:07.207
And I suppose you prefer

50:07.341 --> 50:09.644
the camaraderie of
the thieves guild, huh?

50:10.512 --> 50:12.346
I'm not with the guild.

50:12.479 --> 50:14.816
Not anymore.
They found me too...

50:14.949 --> 50:16.818
...impulsive.

50:16.951 --> 50:18.418
You know, I used
to sack the palace

50:18.553 --> 50:20.187
for fun all by myself.

50:21.523 --> 50:23.090
Yeah, but that game
certainly got stale once

50:23.223 --> 50:25.392
the palace's bravest were sent
off to die in this war.

50:25.527 --> 50:29.496
But still, I suppose I am always
looking for my next challenge.

50:29.631 --> 50:33.400
Oh, is that what we are,
the next challenge?

50:33.735 --> 50:37.070
No, no, I already said I have
no intention of robbing you.

50:39.206 --> 50:40.909
But I have been having fun.

50:41.475 --> 50:42.944
Yeah, right.

50:47.982 --> 50:50.552
Huh.
An Abraxeon battle camp.

50:50.685 --> 50:51.920
How exciting.

50:52.052 --> 50:53.387
Do you think these
guys have some food?

50:53.521 --> 50:54.689
Wait.

50:56.223 --> 50:57.357
Hey!

51:01.029 --> 51:03.031
- Hello?
- Hey--

51:03.163 --> 51:05.198
Oh.

51:29.958 --> 51:31.659
Dreadites.

51:31.793 --> 51:33.795
But they moved on long ago.

51:33.928 --> 51:36.396
Huh. Onions.

51:50.945 --> 51:51.980
Move!

51:59.386 --> 52:02.690
We have you now,
Deathstalker.

52:12.100 --> 52:13.300
Where are you going?

52:14.267 --> 52:15.369
Let's go!

52:20.508 --> 52:22.610
Scarabus'
exploits are legendary.

52:22.744 --> 52:23.978
You really are attracting

52:24.112 --> 52:25.880
the very best assassins
in the kingdom, my friend.

52:26.014 --> 52:27.347
Please shut up.

52:37.457 --> 52:39.661
I'll just use
my magic to protect you.

52:39.794 --> 52:41.328
I don't need
your wizarding ways

52:41.461 --> 52:42.664
getting me killed!

52:42.797 --> 52:44.331
Excuse me?

52:44.464 --> 52:46.500
My powers have been nothing
but helpful.

53:33.413 --> 53:34.448
Yes! It worked!

53:35.983 --> 53:37.350
Oh, sorry.

53:40.722 --> 53:42.623
You cannot escape us.

53:43.991 --> 53:45.358
Yes, I can.

54:18.126 --> 54:19.227
There!

54:27.735 --> 54:31.105
That thing can--
can teleport and--

54:37.410 --> 54:38.613
Okay.

54:41.249 --> 54:42.784
I should thank you.

54:46.654 --> 54:48.256
But I'm not going to.

55:04.906 --> 55:06.373
Let me see it.

55:09.610 --> 55:10.845
Can you stitch me up?

55:10.978 --> 55:13.681
No, I, uh, got something better.

55:14.849 --> 55:17.285
Hold these healing crystals

55:17.417 --> 55:18.653
against your arm.

55:18.786 --> 55:19.887
What are those?

55:20.021 --> 55:22.190
The amethyst is going
to purify the cut.

55:22.322 --> 55:24.324
The bloodstone helps
with circulation,

55:24.457 --> 55:27.360
and the tiger's eye
will help to lessen your fear.

55:27.494 --> 55:30.198
-My fear?
-Yes.

55:30.330 --> 55:32.166
Your fear of dying
from your wounds.

55:36.369 --> 55:38.706
And you think you can read
people like me?

55:39.439 --> 55:41.909
-Aah! Ow!
-There you go.

55:43.778 --> 55:46.180
I never figured a thief
for an alchemist.

55:46.314 --> 55:47.748
Yeah, well.

55:48.381 --> 55:50.350
Unlike you...

55:50.483 --> 55:52.320
my heart is, uh...

55:52.452 --> 55:53.988
a bit more complicated.

55:54.622 --> 55:56.356
What does your heart have to do
with anything?

55:57.558 --> 56:00.194
We all have our own hearts,
Deathstalker.

56:02.129 --> 56:04.065
It's what rules our fate.

56:04.198 --> 56:06.200
I've seen more than
a fair share of hearts

56:06.334 --> 56:07.702
- at the end of my sword.
- Mh-hm?

56:07.835 --> 56:09.369
And they all look
the same to me.

56:10.571 --> 56:11.906
Ow!

56:18.980 --> 56:20.214
Hey.

56:21.582 --> 56:23.618
I'm glad you stuck around.

56:26.554 --> 56:27.788
Sure.

56:41.736 --> 56:43.070
- Ah! That's it!
- What?

56:43.204 --> 56:45.438
The runes. I've deciphered them.

56:45.573 --> 56:47.074
What does it say?

56:47.208 --> 56:48.408
Ah...

56:59.053 --> 57:00.288
It's done.

57:01.889 --> 57:04.792
You're now free
from the amulet's bonds.

57:06.193 --> 57:07.427
Oh.

57:10.264 --> 57:11.599
Thank you, my friend.

57:11.732 --> 57:13.500
But wait, there's more.

57:15.102 --> 57:17.805
Behold Talon's prophecy.

57:19.307 --> 57:21.008
<i>This kingdom</i>
<i>was once ruled</i>

57:21.142 --> 57:24.245
<i>by the magic</i>
<i>of two supreme beings.</i>

57:24.378 --> 57:26.914
<i>Talon, the wizard king of light.</i>

57:27.048 --> 57:30.251
<i>Sytor, the</i>
<i>witch-lord of darkness.</i>

57:30.384 --> 57:33.854
<i>Together, these titans battled</i>
<i>over the fate of existence</i>

57:33.988 --> 57:36.857
<i>using the mortals</i>
<i>as their pawns.</i>

57:36.991 --> 57:39.827
<i>As Sytor's power grew</i>
<i>too strong to defeat,</i>

57:39.961 --> 57:42.630
Talon created a weapon
so powerful

57:42.763 --> 57:44.332
that only those that walked

57:44.464 --> 57:48.369
between the worlds of life
and death could wield it.

57:48.501 --> 57:50.871
It was hidden within
this magic amulet,

57:51.005 --> 57:52.472
passed down
through the generations,

57:52.606 --> 57:56.444
until its true purpose
was completely forgotten.

57:56.577 --> 57:57.812
What kind of
weapon does it hide?

57:57.945 --> 57:59.513
A weapon unlike any that has

57:59.647 --> 58:01.983
ever existed
in this world before.

58:05.152 --> 58:06.120
<i>A weapon</i>

58:06.253 --> 58:09.991
<i>known as the Light of Talon.</i>

58:14.528 --> 58:16.063
It's beautiful.

58:17.665 --> 58:19.033
The perfect sword.

58:19.166 --> 58:22.136
One day, a warrior will
rise to wield its four blades

58:22.269 --> 58:25.339
to extinguish
the four hearts of evil,

58:25.473 --> 58:30.011
saving the kingdom from a
never-ending reign of darkness.

58:55.736 --> 58:57.238
Doodad! Come on!

58:57.371 --> 58:59.673
Get out of here. Gah.

59:08.983 --> 59:10.284
Brisbayne?

59:12.553 --> 59:13.888
Brisbayne?

59:14.855 --> 59:16.390
The amulet.

59:17.358 --> 59:19.794
She took it.
That rotten little...

59:23.064 --> 59:24.932
I slept terribly
last night.

59:25.066 --> 59:26.634
You're going to have
to carry me.

59:29.236 --> 59:30.971
No, don't.

59:31.105 --> 59:32.873
There's too many of them.

59:50.559 --> 59:51.792
I know this path.

59:51.926 --> 59:54.261
We are headed
to the dead swamps.

59:55.262 --> 59:58.065
It's a dangerous place.
If you do not tread lightly,

59:58.199 --> 01:00:00.768
you'll awaken the ancient curse
that lives below.

01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:03.404
Perfect. That's just what
we need right now.

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:05.639
What evil lives in these walls?

01:00:05.773 --> 01:00:08.175
I only know rumors. Stories.

01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:11.011
Diseased men cast out
from their villages,

01:00:11.145 --> 01:00:12.313
absorbed by the earth

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:14.482
and resurrected
into vengeful spirits

01:00:14.615 --> 01:00:16.484
that have forgotten
the joys of music

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:19.320
or the comfort
of a brotherly hug.

01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:20.821
That is all I know.

01:00:20.955 --> 01:00:23.624
No one who has encountered
them face to face

01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:25.826
has lived to tell the tale.

01:00:37.738 --> 01:00:39.640
What else do you have?

01:00:49.416 --> 01:00:50.851
It's empty.

01:00:56.023 --> 01:00:57.458
There he is.

01:00:58.527 --> 01:01:00.394
The one who got away.

01:01:00.529 --> 01:01:02.997
Brisbayne's really proven
herself worthy

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:04.798
by helping us capture you.

01:01:04.932 --> 01:01:08.969
And bringing me the most
valuable item in the kingdom.

01:01:10.004 --> 01:01:12.641
Halgan's precious amulet.

01:01:12.773 --> 01:01:14.875
-Mwah.
-And you brought us here

01:01:15.009 --> 01:01:17.579
to give us our share
of the reward, right?

01:01:17.711 --> 01:01:20.147
I don't remember
you being so generous, Grendul.

01:01:24.818 --> 01:01:26.353
I'm generous to those

01:01:26.487 --> 01:01:28.856
who follow the rules
and share the wealth.

01:01:30.525 --> 01:01:33.027
These are troubling times,
after all.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.929
We thieves must stick together.

01:01:35.062 --> 01:01:37.865
Look at her.

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:42.369
Brisbayne, you're one of us
forever now.

01:01:42.503 --> 01:01:44.004
Bravo!

01:01:44.138 --> 01:01:45.739
Hooray!

01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:47.875
Hey! Stop it!

01:01:48.008 --> 01:01:49.511
We're family here.

01:01:49.644 --> 01:01:52.413
For a family to get along,
there has to be rules.

01:01:53.047 --> 01:01:54.448
You know this.

01:01:54.915 --> 01:01:56.884
Did I not warn you years ago

01:01:57.017 --> 01:01:58.419
that there would be a price
for not paying us

01:01:58.553 --> 01:02:01.055
our proper share
of your bounties?

01:02:01.188 --> 01:02:02.691
Yeah, you warned me.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:08.262
I just didn't care.

01:02:11.566 --> 01:02:13.100
Do them fast.

01:02:13.234 --> 01:02:14.603
Prince Baldur
expects us to meet him

01:02:14.735 --> 01:02:16.770
at Grimvault before nightfall.

01:02:16.904 --> 01:02:19.373
Truly despicable act,
I must say.

01:02:19.507 --> 01:02:24.245
Robbing a dead prince of his
most precious family heirloom.

01:02:24.378 --> 01:02:27.047
I'm sure Baldur will appreciate
its return,

01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:29.316
for a tidy sum, of course.

01:02:31.452 --> 01:02:33.320
We have a saying in the guild.

01:02:34.888 --> 01:02:37.291
If you only serve yourself,

01:02:37.424 --> 01:02:39.561
a reckoning you'll be served.

01:02:45.966 --> 01:02:48.502
And now, gentlemen,

01:02:48.637 --> 01:02:50.639
your reckoning is served.

01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:52.273
Wait!

01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:56.611
Isn't there another way?
Can't you just...

01:02:56.745 --> 01:02:57.845
smack him around a little?

01:02:57.978 --> 01:03:00.281
Stick to your flute,
Brisbayne.

01:03:00.414 --> 01:03:01.949
Archers!

01:03:03.984 --> 01:03:06.920
Fire!

01:03:43.324 --> 01:03:44.491
Get them!

01:03:49.363 --> 01:03:50.864
Archers!

01:03:51.766 --> 01:03:53.033
Fire!

01:03:56.370 --> 01:03:57.739
Here, help me out! Untie me!

01:03:57.871 --> 01:03:59.574
No! You untie me first.

01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:01.875
No! You untie me.
I can't help you.

01:04:02.009 --> 01:04:04.345
-Come on.
-All right, fine.

01:04:06.648 --> 01:04:08.182
Fire!

01:04:40.715 --> 01:04:42.851
No!

01:05:29.697 --> 01:05:31.733
They've forgotten
the joy of music.

01:05:32.433 --> 01:05:35.235
Or the comfort
of a brotherly hug.

01:05:37.237 --> 01:05:38.606
Wait.

01:05:41.475 --> 01:05:43.143
No.

01:05:43.277 --> 01:05:44.945
That's right.

01:05:47.916 --> 01:05:49.784
Oh, no.

01:05:49.918 --> 01:05:51.251
Yes.

01:06:35.763 --> 01:06:38.298
-Deathstalker.
-Hmm?

01:06:40.033 --> 01:06:41.803
We can leave now.

01:06:41.936 --> 01:06:43.237
Okay.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:57.217
Come on. Hop on.

01:07:06.895 --> 01:07:07.929
Remind me,

01:07:08.061 --> 01:07:09.263
why are we going
to Grimvault again?

01:07:09.396 --> 01:07:10.865
The Royal family
is waiting for the amulet

01:07:10.999 --> 01:07:13.166
so the forces of good
can summon the Light of Talon.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:14.536
There's no time to waste.

01:07:14.669 --> 01:07:16.538
Well, there
better be a sweet reward

01:07:16.671 --> 01:07:18.071
at the end of all this.

01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:20.073
Is saving the world
not enough of a reward?

01:07:20.207 --> 01:07:21.543
Nope!

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:45.065
I'm cold.

01:07:45.198 --> 01:07:47.067
Can you fetch my blanket?

01:08:11.059 --> 01:08:12.660
Something wrong, my lord?

01:08:12.794 --> 01:08:14.161
It's just...

01:08:16.129 --> 01:08:17.932
Oh, my God,
you're going to hate me.

01:08:18.967 --> 01:08:20.735
You know, I'm a little warm.

01:08:28.442 --> 01:08:29.811
Baldur.

01:08:35.984 --> 01:08:38.519
You're not that lady
from the Thieves Guild.

01:08:38.653 --> 01:08:40.855
My name is Deathstalker,

01:08:40.989 --> 01:08:42.322
and I'm here for the reward.

01:08:42.456 --> 01:08:45.292
Oh! Deathstalker!

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:54.535
Mother speaks highly of you.

01:08:55.235 --> 01:08:56.704
Your...

01:08:57.672 --> 01:08:59.841
...swordsmanship is legendary.

01:08:59.974 --> 01:09:02.342
I didn't realize the Queen
held me in such high regard.

01:09:02.476 --> 01:09:05.013
Yes, she says,
of all the traitorous parasites

01:09:05.145 --> 01:09:07.615
sucking the kingdom dry, you...

01:09:08.382 --> 01:09:09.316
are the most handsome.

01:09:09.449 --> 01:09:10.785
That is so sweet.

01:09:10.918 --> 01:09:13.621
Yeah. Wish she'd say such
nice things about me.

01:09:19.527 --> 01:09:22.295
Ah! Anyway.

01:09:28.536 --> 01:09:30.470
Sure was a rough road
getting here.

01:09:31.304 --> 01:09:33.306
We were pursued by many foes.

01:09:46.054 --> 01:09:47.689
You know,
we almost didn't make it.

01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:49.657
So many foes.

01:09:59.232 --> 01:10:00.535
Hmm?

01:10:16.050 --> 01:10:17.552
Poor Halgan.

01:10:18.586 --> 01:10:21.089
He always was the unlucky one.

01:10:27.427 --> 01:10:28.428
Rocks.

01:10:28.563 --> 01:10:30.865
Oh, I had no intention
of paying you.

01:10:34.769 --> 01:10:37.304
So these are just regular rocks?

01:10:37.437 --> 01:10:39.907
Not expensive, royal rocks
or anything like that?

01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:42.610
No, just normal dumb rocks.

01:10:45.947 --> 01:10:47.749
Mother will be pleased
when I bring her the head

01:10:47.882 --> 01:10:51.418
of the kingdom's most
notorious deserter and thief.

01:10:52.053 --> 01:10:56.090
The once-mighty
Deathstalker!

01:10:57.225 --> 01:10:58.458
You forgot handsome.

01:10:59.093 --> 01:11:00.895
And you know what else
she would really like?

01:11:01.028 --> 01:11:02.262
This.

01:11:05.633 --> 01:11:07.769
Kill him! Get him!

01:11:24.719 --> 01:11:26.319
Dreadites!

01:11:36.429 --> 01:11:37.632
Watch out!

01:11:41.301 --> 01:11:43.805
I've got it!
Begone foul creature!

01:11:45.273 --> 01:11:46.974
Nice shot.
Let's go.

01:12:17.672 --> 01:12:19.472
I will, my friend.

01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:32.887
I told you this wasn't over.

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.990
Before you ask, no.

01:12:36.489 --> 01:12:38.526
You can't have your sword back.

01:12:41.696 --> 01:12:42.730
Keep it.

01:12:43.564 --> 01:12:44.832
Stay back.

01:12:46.534 --> 01:12:49.937
Again you hide behind steel.

01:12:50.071 --> 01:12:51.438
True power

01:12:51.572 --> 01:12:54.008
comes from more than just
the sword.

01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:59.780
Your madness
ends tonight, Jotak,

01:12:59.914 --> 01:13:02.750
even if I have to do it
with my bare hands.

01:13:02.884 --> 01:13:05.385
My eyes have
been opened, Tritus.

01:13:06.587 --> 01:13:09.422
The only way you will
know the truth

01:13:09.557 --> 01:13:11.025
is in death!

01:13:45.359 --> 01:13:46.827
Deathstalker!

01:13:58.606 --> 01:13:59.740
Brisbayne!

01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:04.178
Hey. I'm so sorry
about what happened.

01:14:04.312 --> 01:14:06.113
I didn't mean to--

01:14:08.481 --> 01:14:10.084
Who is this?

01:14:10.217 --> 01:14:11.986
A friend of yours?

01:14:12.119 --> 01:14:13.453
Definitely not a friend.

01:14:13.587 --> 01:14:15.690
I said I was sorry!

01:14:38.012 --> 01:14:39.113
No!

01:15:36.704 --> 01:15:37.838
Let me go!

01:15:37.972 --> 01:15:39.540
You vile creatures!

01:15:48.716 --> 01:15:51.252
Give it to me.

01:15:52.086 --> 01:15:53.254
It's yours.

01:15:53.387 --> 01:15:55.756
I don't know what Mother
wants with it anyway.

01:15:55.890 --> 01:15:57.124
- At last.
- There.

01:15:57.258 --> 01:15:58.592
You have what you want.

01:15:58.726 --> 01:15:59.960
Just free me,

01:16:00.094 --> 01:16:03.030
you undead cretin!

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.235
Of course.

01:16:15.242 --> 01:16:16.377
-Oh, wow--

01:16:22.349 --> 01:16:26.320
Tonight we ride to
Nekromemnon's fortress.

01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:29.256
And to victory!

01:18:45.993 --> 01:18:47.461
Jotak was right.

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:52.132
Death does open your eyes
to a lot.

01:18:54.835 --> 01:18:56.538
I know what I have to do now.

01:18:58.607 --> 01:19:00.374
I have to save my friends.

01:19:02.443 --> 01:19:04.445
And they've got a day's
start on me.

01:19:05.446 --> 01:19:07.114
How do I get to them in time?

01:19:18.593 --> 01:19:20.294
That'll work.

01:19:53.561 --> 01:19:55.129
Restrain the wizard.

01:19:57.231 --> 01:19:59.333
Bring the thief to me.

01:20:06.073 --> 01:20:08.643
Kneel before your master.

01:20:21.822 --> 01:20:23.857
The will of Sytor

01:20:23.991 --> 01:20:26.393
that brought you before me.

01:20:27.194 --> 01:20:29.664
This is your destiny:

01:20:29.798 --> 01:20:34.569
to serve us for all eternity.

01:20:34.703 --> 01:20:38.205
Thing is, I didn't really like
the last club that I joined.

01:20:38.339 --> 01:20:40.742
Well, if you'd prefer...

01:20:43.545 --> 01:20:46.046
I could just rip your heart out.

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:49.883
But it sounds like I get
to live forever in this one, so,

01:20:50.017 --> 01:20:51.852
that sounds good, too.

01:20:53.854 --> 01:20:57.358
All the powers of darkness

01:20:57.491 --> 01:20:59.226
will be yours.

01:21:01.962 --> 01:21:03.864
Okay, okay.
Uh, hang on a second.

01:21:03.997 --> 01:21:06.534
-Where are we going?
-You can join us

01:21:06.668 --> 01:21:09.236
in rebuilding this world...

01:21:10.037 --> 01:21:12.873
as it was meant to be.

01:21:13.307 --> 01:21:14.509
- No, no.
- In the

01:21:14.642 --> 01:21:17.378
image of Sytor.

01:21:19.179 --> 01:21:20.948
- I think I'll pass.
- Yes!

01:21:21.081 --> 01:21:23.350
Oh, okay. No, no, no, no!

01:21:23.484 --> 01:21:25.553
Oh! Oh.

01:21:25.687 --> 01:21:29.423
More, more! Yes!

01:21:33.695 --> 01:21:35.129
Oh, yes.

01:21:37.264 --> 01:21:40.769
In the hands of a mere mortal

01:21:40.901 --> 01:21:43.036
it's quite useless.

01:21:43.170 --> 01:21:45.072
But in the hands of one

01:21:45.205 --> 01:21:48.409
who walks between
life and death

01:21:48.543 --> 01:21:51.912
it could spell our demise.

01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:56.651
But no more! No more!

01:21:56.785 --> 01:22:00.120
The light of Talon dies tonight!

01:22:04.224 --> 01:22:06.561
- Nekromemnon!
- Huh?

01:22:06.694 --> 01:22:08.328
You're mad!

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.768
There it is.

01:22:13.902 --> 01:22:15.770
There it is.

01:22:16.905 --> 01:22:18.773
It is time.

01:22:19.306 --> 01:22:22.677
Abraxeon will fall!

01:22:23.444 --> 01:22:28.182
There is no one who can stand
in my way.

01:22:34.121 --> 01:22:35.489
Oh, oh, oh.

01:22:41.295 --> 01:22:42.963
What the fuck is that?

01:22:43.096 --> 01:22:45.165
Here I come!

01:22:49.436 --> 01:22:50.939
Dreadites.

01:22:51.071 --> 01:22:53.307
Rip him to pieces!

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.008
Deathstalker!
Behind you!

01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.687
Oh! Get up!

01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:07.555
Get up, you fool!

01:23:07.689 --> 01:23:08.989
Look out there!

01:23:10.692 --> 01:23:12.226
Ha, ha! Yes!

01:23:12.359 --> 01:23:14.061
-You're alive!
-Doodad, are you all right?

01:23:14.194 --> 01:23:15.864
Oh, I'm good.
Just get me out of these.

01:23:17.866 --> 01:23:19.199
Oh, it's so good to see you.

01:23:19.333 --> 01:23:20.735
What took you so long?

01:23:20.869 --> 01:23:22.135
The wraith, it got lost,

01:23:22.269 --> 01:23:24.404
and I was in the swamp,
and I got resurrected.

01:23:24.539 --> 01:23:25.640
There was a lot going on.

01:23:25.773 --> 01:23:27.675
We have to help Brisbayne.

01:23:33.180 --> 01:23:35.683
You're too late,
Deathstalker.

01:23:35.817 --> 01:23:37.050
What are you doing to her?

01:23:37.184 --> 01:23:41.923
Her heart
has joined the dark beyond.

01:23:42.055 --> 01:23:45.392
She is now the vessel

01:23:45.527 --> 01:23:47.227
of Sytor.

01:23:49.631 --> 01:23:50.999
Don't worry.

01:23:58.071 --> 01:24:00.508
You can't save her.

01:24:02.677 --> 01:24:04.879
It's time
I put you down for good.

01:24:22.095 --> 01:24:23.430
Hey!

01:24:24.064 --> 01:24:26.734
This ends here, sorcerer.

01:24:26.868 --> 01:24:30.103
You say, "Hey" to me?

01:24:30.237 --> 01:24:31.940
Oh, dear.

01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:33.407
Hey!

01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:39.413
The magic you wield
is but child's play

01:24:40.247 --> 01:24:42.050
compared to mine.

01:24:42.182 --> 01:24:45.085
Your arrogance will be
your undoing, Nekromemnon.

01:24:45.218 --> 01:24:48.790
Oh good heavens,
I'm so scared.

01:24:48.923 --> 01:24:53.327
Well, come on then.
Let's have at it.

01:25:30.765 --> 01:25:32.366
Give it to me!

01:26:08.636 --> 01:26:10.071
Goodbye, old friend.

01:26:48.408 --> 01:26:51.378
Your aim still hasn't improved,

01:26:51.512 --> 01:26:57.151
Son of Amax.

01:27:00.588 --> 01:27:03.423
You missed me.
You missed me, again.

01:27:03.558 --> 01:27:05.727
Did I?

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:10.698
What's that?

01:27:10.832 --> 01:27:13.534
Oh, dear!

01:27:13.668 --> 01:27:19.306
Did I Doodad?

01:27:46.968 --> 01:27:49.103
Ah! Ah, yes!

01:27:49.237 --> 01:27:50.972
Oh, yes!

01:27:51.105 --> 01:27:54.008
Sytor is risen!

01:27:56.744 --> 01:28:01.749
Sytor, yes!

01:28:01.883 --> 01:28:05.686
You've come!
Sytor, you've come!

01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.123
You've come. You've come.

01:28:09.257 --> 01:28:14.896
Come, come, come.

01:28:15.630 --> 01:28:19.700
My queen, yes!

01:28:19.834 --> 01:28:25.472
Yes, yes! Ah!

01:28:29.944 --> 01:28:31.145
Any ideas, wizard?

01:28:31.279 --> 01:28:33.614
The light of Talon
has been destroyed!

01:28:33.748 --> 01:28:35.850
Sytor will consume us all!

01:28:35.983 --> 01:28:38.619
It's over, Deathstalker.

01:28:38.753 --> 01:28:40.855
I thought I was a pessimist.

01:28:40.988 --> 01:28:42.489
Deathstalker, no!

01:28:42.623 --> 01:28:46.694
It's too late!

01:29:00.308 --> 01:29:01.676
<i>In the hands of one</i>

01:29:01.809 --> 01:29:04.579
<i>who walks between life</i>
<i>and death...</i>

01:29:04.712 --> 01:29:10.251
<i>could spell our demise.</i>

01:30:22.623 --> 01:30:28.229
Deathstaker! There! Go!

01:30:29.630 --> 01:30:33.634
<i>We all have our own</i>
<i>hearts, Deathstalker.</i>

01:30:33.768 --> 01:30:37.470
It's what rules our fate.

01:30:37.605 --> 01:30:38.773
<i>I've seen</i>
<i>more than a fair</i>

01:30:38.906 --> 01:30:41.008
<i>share of hearts</i>
<i>at the end of my sword.</i>

01:30:41.142 --> 01:30:43.911
<i>And they all look</i>
<i>the same to me.</i>

01:30:44.045 --> 01:30:45.780
<i>Wield the four blades</i>
<i>to extinguish</i>

01:30:45.913 --> 01:30:49.083
<i>the four hearts of evil.</i>

01:30:49.216 --> 01:30:50.785
Hurry, Deathstalker!

01:30:50.918 --> 01:30:53.321
Fulfill the prophecy.

01:30:53.453 --> 01:30:59.093
No. I'm doing this my way.

01:31:29.623 --> 01:31:30.558
Brisbayne!

01:31:30.691 --> 01:31:32.526
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:36.697
Come on. Hey, Brisbayne.

01:31:36.831 --> 01:31:38.733
Brisbayne. Come on.

01:31:38.866 --> 01:31:40.334
Wake up! Wake up!

01:31:42.303 --> 01:31:43.537
She's alive!

01:31:43.671 --> 01:31:45.573
- You're okay.
- I'm okay.

01:31:45.706 --> 01:31:46.640
Of course.

01:31:46.774 --> 01:31:48.009
Sytor only had three hearts.

01:31:48.142 --> 01:31:50.878
Just like the alignment
of the three moons.

01:31:51.012 --> 01:31:52.980
Oh, my goodness,
that was a very lucky guess,

01:31:53.114 --> 01:31:53.881
Deathstalker.

01:31:54.015 --> 01:31:56.684
I wasn't guessing, Doodad.

01:31:56.817 --> 01:32:01.188
Someone once taught me
that we all have our own heart.

01:32:01.322 --> 01:32:03.691
So I just avoided the one that,

01:32:03.824 --> 01:32:06.560
well....

01:32:06.694 --> 01:32:08.329
Looked complicated.

01:32:10.865 --> 01:32:11.665
-Come on, let's go.
-Okay.

01:32:11.799 --> 01:32:14.668
Get up. Yeah. You're back.

01:32:34.688 --> 01:32:36.690
Hey.

01:32:36.824 --> 01:32:41.862
You may want to wash that off.

01:32:41.996 --> 01:32:43.631
Meh.

01:32:43.764 --> 01:32:47.568
You know what?

01:32:47.701 --> 01:32:49.370
I think we earned ourselves
a bit of music.

01:32:49.503 --> 01:32:52.940
-What? You found it? Thank you!
-I did.

01:32:53.074 --> 01:32:54.975
Hey, don't
you understand what this means,

01:32:55.109 --> 01:32:56.944
Deathstalker?

01:32:57.078 --> 01:32:59.113
You've rewritten the prophecy.

01:32:59.246 --> 01:33:00.614
You are
the one that saved the kingdom

01:33:00.748 --> 01:33:02.716
from the never
ending reign of darkness.

01:33:02.850 --> 01:33:04.051
Yeah.

01:33:04.185 --> 01:33:05.953
You could walk
right into the palace now

01:33:06.087 --> 01:33:09.623
and take the throne
if you wanted to.

01:33:09.757 --> 01:33:15.396
Huh.

01:33:29.210 --> 01:33:33.280
It's a perfect sword.

01:33:33.414 --> 01:33:35.483
But a weapon like this

01:33:35.616 --> 01:33:41.222
should not rule our fate's.

01:33:41.622 --> 01:33:44.158
Destroy it.

01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:49.930
If that is what you wish.

01:33:53.734 --> 01:33:55.436
Ow! Doodad!

01:33:55.570 --> 01:33:58.272
Sorry.
Just stay still. Once more.

01:33:58.405 --> 01:33:59.840
What do you mean? I'm
standing still.

01:33:59.974 --> 01:34:05.112
Hold it high!

01:34:07.181 --> 01:34:08.282
Come on!

01:34:08.415 --> 01:34:09.416
The sword is here.

01:34:09.551 --> 01:34:11.318
Don't move, don't move!
Hold it up.

01:34:11.452 --> 01:34:12.853
-I can do this.
-You're doing this on purpose.

01:34:12.987 --> 01:34:14.788
I'm not doing this on purpose.
Honestly.

01:34:14.922 --> 01:34:16.290
-I'm gonna put it on the ground.
-No. You can't.

01:34:16.423 --> 01:34:17.626
-You have to hold it up.
-Why?

01:34:17.758 --> 01:34:20.861
The one who fulfills
the prophecy has to hold it.

01:34:20.995 --> 01:34:23.063
-Hold it high!
-I'm pointing it far away.

01:34:23.197 --> 01:34:24.298
I'll get it this time. Ready?

01:34:24.431 --> 01:34:25.699
I swear to God,

01:34:25.833 --> 01:34:27.801
if you hit me one more time,
I'm going to spank you.

01:34:27.935 --> 01:34:29.904
Okay?

01:34:30.037 --> 01:34:32.507
One last chance.

01:34:32.641 --> 01:34:34.576
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:34:34.708 --> 01:34:37.411
Doodad!
I don't understand you.

01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:43.184
Don't hit me!
