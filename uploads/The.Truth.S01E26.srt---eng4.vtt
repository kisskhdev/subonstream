=The Truth=

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.136
=Episode 26=

00:01:15.534 --> 00:01:17.614
I slashed Monkey's head with a knife.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:23.055
Because of that,
I was detained for 15 days.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:25.894
During my detention,

00:01:26.254 --> 00:01:27.655
they went to Mengqing.

00:01:28.174 --> 00:01:28.855
They told her

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.855
to prepare a coffin for me,

00:01:31.295 --> 00:01:33.495
saying they'd kill me
the moment I was released.

00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:38.174
Mengqing was terrified and wanted
to made peace with them.

00:01:38.334 --> 00:01:39.614
So Mengqing went...

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:46.614
Take your time.

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:50.454
She went to Monkey.

00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:55.814
Monkey told her to sleep with him,

00:01:57.015 --> 00:01:58.575
and then they can let me off.

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:00.695
Mengqing refused

00:02:01.614 --> 00:02:03.254
and knelt on the ground begging him.

00:02:04.575 --> 00:02:05.614
But Monkey...

00:02:23.614 --> 00:02:25.375
They ruined my woman.

00:02:25.494 --> 00:02:26.894
I couldn't swallow that insult.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:31.015
So after my release,
I grabbed a kitchen knife

00:02:31.454 --> 00:02:32.894
and killed Monkey.

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:35.774
Unfortunately,

00:02:36.695 --> 00:02:38.375
while I was killing Monkey,

00:02:39.295 --> 00:02:41.174
his underlings saw me.

00:02:43.054 --> 00:02:47.695
That's how I ended up
serving seventeen years in prison.

00:02:48.975 --> 00:02:50.975
Mengqing waited for me
for those seventeen years.

00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:53.295
But I never expected

00:02:56.054 --> 00:02:58.494
that to compensate Monkey's family,

00:02:59.214 --> 00:03:00.695
Mengqing took out a loan.

00:03:01.535 --> 00:03:02.575
To repay it,

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:06.575
she became a hostess.

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:09.855
Then she relapsed into drugs.

00:03:12.535 --> 00:03:16.255
I only learned this after my release.

00:03:17.575 --> 00:03:18.894
I failed Mengqing.

00:03:20.054 --> 00:03:21.695
I didn't just break her heart,

00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:24.295
but also destroyed her health.

00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:31.575
So I made a decision.

00:03:33.695 --> 00:03:34.494
What decision?

00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:36.535
Since she couldn't quit,

00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:40.654
I'd secretly start using drugs too.

00:03:40.894 --> 00:03:44.494
Then she wouldn't leave me
for fear of dragging me down.

00:03:45.855 --> 00:03:47.695
But she found out.

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:53.015
Why did you claim Zhao Heizi
killed Wang Mengqing?

00:03:56.454 --> 00:04:01.255
Two years ago,
Zhao Heizi was our landlord.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:03.214
He had a gambling habit.

00:04:03.934 --> 00:04:07.494
After losing money,
he'd demand rent from us.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:13.454
One day, he caught Mengqing and me
using drugs in the house.

00:04:15.295 --> 00:04:16.534
Then he blackmailed me,

00:04:16.815 --> 00:04:18.414
demanding ten thousand yuan,

00:04:19.135 --> 00:04:20.534
or he'll call the police.

00:04:21.815 --> 00:04:23.414
(Wang Mengqing, Bai Xue)
Mengqing had just pulled out the needle.

00:04:24.135 --> 00:04:27.654
Suddenly she foamed at the mouth
and collapsed.

00:04:28.854 --> 00:04:31.534
I begged him to let us
go to the hospital first.

00:04:32.454 --> 00:04:35.375
But he refused and insisted
on getting the money first.

00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:38.214
I didn't have any money at that moment.

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:40.974
So we were at a standoff.

00:04:41.854 --> 00:04:47.015
I could only watch
Mengqing dying in my arms.

00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:51.534
It was him!

00:04:51.894 --> 00:04:55.735
He must pay for Mengqing's death.

00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:02.815
Do you know this woman named Bai Xue?

00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:05.534
No.

00:05:12.015 --> 00:05:13.214
Lu Jun, you're lying.

00:05:14.575 --> 00:05:16.015
Wang Mengqing isn't dead.

00:05:19.135 --> 00:05:19.935
Bai Xue.

00:05:21.214 --> 00:05:24.695
We've caught Zhao Heizi's killer.

00:05:25.214 --> 00:05:26.894
You should know Lu Jun, right?

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:31.575
He said you met at a bar
in the year of 2000.

00:05:34.615 --> 00:05:36.214
Just past history.

00:05:36.214 --> 00:05:37.015
Bai Xue.

00:05:38.294 --> 00:05:40.015
Two years ago, you were Wang Mengqing.

00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:43.695
Why did Lu Jun claim Wang Mengqing died

00:05:44.414 --> 00:05:48.175
and that he killed Zhao Heizi for her?

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:53.974
It seems that Lu Jun told you
a moving love story.

00:05:55.894 --> 00:05:56.815
About the photo...

00:05:57.055 --> 00:05:58.255
When I came to see you,

00:05:59.654 --> 00:06:02.414
you already knew it was Lu Jun,
didn't you?

00:06:04.815 --> 00:06:06.454
Wang Mengqing did die,

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:09.214
just not two years ago.

00:06:09.935 --> 00:06:14.214
Wang Mengqing died seventeen years ago.

00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:17.015
After Lu Jun went to prison,

00:06:17.495 --> 00:06:21.815
I endured by swallowing
every ounce of bitterness.

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:24.495
I never wanted to see him
after his release.

00:06:25.935 --> 00:06:29.294
What did he ever do
for me all these years?

00:06:29.695 --> 00:06:31.495
He was the one who messed up,

00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:37.214
yet I was the one
struggling to repay the loan.

00:06:38.615 --> 00:06:40.255
By the time I realized all this,

00:06:41.495 --> 00:06:43.175
all I felt for him was hate.

00:06:44.294 --> 00:06:45.854
But Lu Jun didn't get it.

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:50.414
He was moved
by my seventeen years of sacrifice,

00:06:52.454 --> 00:06:54.015
thought he owed me,

00:06:54.334 --> 00:06:55.654
and wanted to make it up to me.

00:06:56.575 --> 00:06:57.894
He trapped me repeatedly

00:06:58.654 --> 00:07:01.695
in the room with his suffocating love.

00:07:10.294 --> 00:07:11.654
Will you let me go or not?

00:07:18.294 --> 00:07:19.815
At first, I kept moving

00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:22.495
to avoid him.

00:07:23.534 --> 00:07:28.894
Later, I unexpectedly discovered
I was pregnant.

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:37.055
I feel this child
is my reason to keep living.

00:07:39.175 --> 00:07:41.055
So to have my child,

00:07:42.575 --> 00:07:44.615
I forced myself to quit drugs again.

00:07:48.375 --> 00:07:49.695
Mengqing!

00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:51.495
Sorry.

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:52.534
- Sorry, Mengqing.
- My stomach!

00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:54.815
What's wrong with your stomach?

00:07:55.854 --> 00:07:57.015
Mengqing!

00:07:57.015 --> 00:07:57.974
I didn't mean to.

00:07:57.974 --> 00:07:58.894
I'm sorry.

00:07:59.094 --> 00:07:59.615
Sorry.

00:07:59.615 --> 00:08:00.815
Help!

00:08:00.815 --> 00:08:03.255
That was my only chance to be a mother.

00:08:05.974 --> 00:08:08.615
Later, Lu Jun forced me
to live with him again.

00:08:09.894 --> 00:08:11.894
He said he'd take good care of me.

00:08:12.414 --> 00:08:13.935
But I didn't need that.

00:08:16.175 --> 00:08:18.974
He became more extreme and twisted.

00:08:34.735 --> 00:08:36.534
So Lu Jun was sent to rehab,

00:08:37.574 --> 00:08:39.574
and it's a scheme
you and Zhao Heizi set up?

00:08:39.814 --> 00:08:40.615
Yes.

00:08:41.615 --> 00:08:43.414
I had no other choice back then.

00:08:45.934 --> 00:08:47.855
Open up! Rent collection!

00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:10.735
Zhao.

00:09:11.534 --> 00:09:12.814
You're early today.

00:09:14.215 --> 00:09:15.015
Don't worry.

00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:17.174
I have your rent ready.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.015
I just bought groceries.

00:09:20.574 --> 00:09:22.135
Come in for a meal before you go?

00:09:22.455 --> 00:09:23.495
No need.

00:09:23.694 --> 00:09:24.495
Thank you.

00:09:24.735 --> 00:09:26.375
I have to play mahjong

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:27.894
after collecting rent.

00:09:27.894 --> 00:09:28.735
Right on time.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.135
You two eat up.

00:09:30.735 --> 00:09:31.814
I'm off. Bye.

00:09:31.975 --> 00:09:32.774
Take care.

00:11:00.015 --> 00:11:00.814
Who is it?

00:11:01.615 --> 00:11:02.574
It's me.

00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:03.934
Rent collection. Open up.

00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:06.495
Just a second.

00:11:51.934 --> 00:11:52.735
Police.

00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:56.534
Someone's using drugs in my rental unit.

00:12:01.015 --> 00:12:03.934
Why did Lu Jun claim Wang Mengqing died?

00:12:06.294 --> 00:12:08.255
After Lu Jun went to rehab,

00:12:08.654 --> 00:12:10.534
our belongings
were still with Zhao Heizi.

00:12:11.215 --> 00:12:13.015
When Lu Jun's brother came for them,

00:12:13.574 --> 00:12:15.215
Zhao asked him to pass a message,

00:12:16.054 --> 00:12:18.375
saying my long-term drug use

00:12:19.015 --> 00:12:20.455
killed me at the hospital that day.

00:12:20.975 --> 00:12:21.975
Lu Jun believed it?

00:12:22.615 --> 00:12:23.934
Partly, I guess.

00:12:25.135 --> 00:12:28.934
But that's probably when Lu Jun
started hating Zhao Heizi.

00:12:31.015 --> 00:12:34.735
You told Zhao Heizi
to say that to Lu Jun's brother?

00:12:36.534 --> 00:12:37.335
No.

00:12:38.654 --> 00:12:41.654
I just wanted to escape Lu Jun

00:12:42.455 --> 00:12:43.975
and get a chance to leave.

00:12:45.135 --> 00:12:47.615
I never meant for Lu Jun
to think I died.

00:12:48.615 --> 00:12:50.294
Zhao Heizi probably didn't expect

00:12:51.335 --> 00:12:54.934
that it would get him killed by Lu Jun.

00:12:55.255 --> 00:12:57.855
Then why would Zhao Heizi do that?

00:12:58.975 --> 00:12:59.814
Why?

00:13:01.135 --> 00:13:02.574
You should ask him.

00:13:09.135 --> 00:13:09.855
Ye.

00:13:10.375 --> 00:13:10.975
Captain Leng.

00:13:10.975 --> 00:13:13.135
How's Bai Xue's investigation going?

00:13:13.455 --> 00:13:15.375
We interviewed Bai Xue's friends.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:16.814
Only Zhao Heizi's mahjong buddies

00:13:16.814 --> 00:13:18.095
heard him mention it.

00:13:18.534 --> 00:13:20.135
It also confirms Bai Xue's claim.

00:13:20.135 --> 00:13:24.054
Zhao Heizi did tell Lu Jun's brother
that Wang Mengqing was dead.

00:13:24.255 --> 00:13:28.054
Besides, Bai Xue left Lu Jun
without taking anything,

00:13:28.054 --> 00:13:29.414
so his brother didn't doubt it.

00:13:29.534 --> 00:13:31.015
But this doesn't prove

00:13:31.015 --> 00:13:33.335
what role Bai Xue played in this case.

00:13:33.335 --> 00:13:33.934
Captain Leng.

00:13:35.054 --> 00:13:35.855
Captain Leng.

00:13:36.135 --> 00:13:36.855
I just checked

00:13:36.855 --> 00:13:38.294
Bai Xue's recent purchase records.

00:13:38.414 --> 00:13:39.335
I found a month ago,

00:13:39.335 --> 00:13:41.455
she bought men's sneakers,

00:13:41.934 --> 00:13:44.294
the same model as the pair
from Lu Jun's hotel room.

00:13:44.934 --> 00:13:46.054
Here's the purchase record.

00:13:50.054 --> 00:13:51.335
If that's the case,

00:13:51.855 --> 00:13:54.095
it proves they met before the murder.

00:13:54.414 --> 00:13:55.534
Bai Xue was lying.

00:13:56.694 --> 00:13:58.975
Pull their chat logs and call records.

00:13:59.495 --> 00:14:00.015
Yes.

00:14:00.015 --> 00:14:01.534
See if there's more evidence.

00:14:01.615 --> 00:14:02.015
Got it.

00:14:02.015 --> 00:14:02.615
Hurry.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.184
(Comparing fingerprints. Please wait.)

00:14:40.184 --> 00:14:42.328
(The target and original fingerprints
belong to two different individuals.)

00:14:47.135 --> 00:14:48.335
Ye Qian, Liu Yang.

00:14:48.495 --> 00:14:49.375
Hand these out.

00:14:49.735 --> 00:14:50.414
Captain Leng.

00:14:51.174 --> 00:14:52.934
We accessed Lu Jun's internet records

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:55.294
from an internet cafe near the hotel.

00:14:55.414 --> 00:14:57.455
His chat logs show

00:14:57.615 --> 00:15:00.814
his contact with Bai Xue
started one month before the murder.

00:15:00.975 --> 00:15:04.054
Chat logs included photos
of Zhao Heizi abusing Bai Xue

00:15:04.174 --> 00:15:06.095
and her accusations against Zhao Heizi.

00:15:06.335 --> 00:15:09.335
Their last contact was
the afternoon before the murder.

00:15:09.654 --> 00:15:13.615
Bai Xue told Lu Jun time and location
of Zhao's visit to the mahjong parlor.

00:15:14.294 --> 00:15:17.015
Bai Xue deliberately planned
for Lu Jun to kill Zhao Heizi.

00:15:18.654 --> 00:15:19.294
Let's go.

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:20.814
Talk to them again.

00:15:24.135 --> 00:15:24.934
Lu Jun.

00:15:26.015 --> 00:15:27.615
Have you seen Bai Xue?

00:15:31.615 --> 00:15:34.735
You mean Zhao Heizi's mistress?

00:15:35.814 --> 00:15:36.735
You've seen her?

00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:39.574
I had trailed Zhao Heizi for a while.

00:15:40.215 --> 00:15:41.455
I saw her from a distance.

00:15:43.414 --> 00:15:44.615
Take a look at this.

00:15:47.975 --> 00:15:50.934
Is this Wang Mengqing or Bai Xue?

00:15:51.455 --> 00:15:53.015
Wang Mengqing is dead.

00:15:54.894 --> 00:15:56.615
This is Bai Xue.

00:15:57.054 --> 00:16:00.534
Zhao Heizi's mistress you mentioned.

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.774
How's it? Doesn't she look familiar?

00:16:06.335 --> 00:16:07.054
Lu Jun.

00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:12.615
Wang Mengqing you claimed
Zhao Heizi killed two years ago

00:16:12.615 --> 00:16:13.934
is now going by the name Bai Xue.

00:16:15.814 --> 00:16:17.335
So did Bai Xue know your plan

00:16:17.615 --> 00:16:18.735
of killing Zhao Heizi?

00:16:19.135 --> 00:16:20.534
I've already told you.

00:16:21.135 --> 00:16:22.774
Mengqing died two years ago.

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.654
I don't know any woman named Bai Xue.

00:16:24.855 --> 00:16:28.855
Seventeen years ago, Wang Mengqing
promised to buy you a pair of shoes.

00:16:29.855 --> 00:16:33.135
Now she has finally
fulfilled that promise, right?

00:16:33.934 --> 00:16:36.534
Bai Xue's fingerprints
are on these shoes.

00:16:37.135 --> 00:16:40.015
Furthermore, from your chat records
with Bai Xue,

00:16:40.375 --> 00:16:44.615
we've uncovered Bai Xue's accusations
against Zhao Heizi.

00:16:45.814 --> 00:16:46.495
Lu Jun.

00:16:47.774 --> 00:16:49.095
Anything else you want to say?

00:16:50.095 --> 00:16:51.894
Killing Zhao Heizi
was my decision alone.

00:16:52.534 --> 00:16:53.975
And I acted alone.

00:16:54.174 --> 00:16:55.735
It has nothing to do with Mengqing.

00:17:01.294 --> 00:17:02.615
Why did you buy that grave?

00:17:06.975 --> 00:17:10.294
While I was in rehab,
I found out Mengqing died.

00:17:10.814 --> 00:17:12.374
I had my brother buy it.

00:17:13.495 --> 00:17:17.094
After her death, I dreamed of her often.

00:17:18.614 --> 00:17:21.415
She told me how much she suffered
over those seventeen years.

00:17:23.574 --> 00:17:27.534
I dreamed she fell down the stairs
and miscarried.

00:17:28.854 --> 00:17:32.215
I even dreamed I locked her up
and wouldn't let her out.

00:17:32.574 --> 00:17:34.094
She begged me to let her go.

00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:37.134
I felt I owed her.

00:17:37.695 --> 00:17:39.255
I regretted it every single day.

00:17:40.495 --> 00:17:45.015
So after I was released, I wanted
to move her remains there.

00:17:45.094 --> 00:17:47.175
But then you discovered
Wang Mengqing wasn't dead

00:17:48.655 --> 00:17:49.655
and became

00:17:51.294 --> 00:17:52.895
Zhao Heizi's mistress as Bai Xue.

00:17:54.495 --> 00:17:57.814
So you got to her and demanded
an explanation from her.

00:17:57.895 --> 00:17:58.695
No.

00:18:00.895 --> 00:18:04.895
I thought Mengqing was living well
with Zhao Heizi.

00:18:05.935 --> 00:18:07.374
But Mengqing told me

00:18:08.294 --> 00:18:11.094
that Zhao Heizi would beat her
whenever he drank.

00:18:11.814 --> 00:18:13.774
He even took her ID card,

00:18:13.895 --> 00:18:15.175
so she couldn't go anywhere.

00:18:16.255 --> 00:18:18.455
And there was no one to help her.

00:18:18.455 --> 00:18:19.094
So I...

00:18:19.094 --> 00:18:21.455
So after you killed Zhao Heizi,

00:18:21.774 --> 00:18:23.255
knowing we'd come to you,

00:18:23.495 --> 00:18:24.695
you led us to the grave

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:27.534
just to make us believe

00:18:28.294 --> 00:18:30.975
that you killed Zhao Heizi
for Wang Mengqing.

00:18:31.495 --> 00:18:34.374
So we wouldn't suspect Bai Xue, right?

00:18:40.735 --> 00:18:42.935
Was it worth it?

00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:57.215
I have never felt the warmth
of a family since I was little.

00:18:59.935 --> 00:19:02.935
Mengqing is my only family
in this world.

00:19:04.294 --> 00:19:06.975
For her, it was worth it.

00:19:17.294 --> 00:19:18.415
You know everything now?

00:19:18.774 --> 00:19:22.015
Ever since you knew
Lu Jun was out of rehab,

00:19:22.695 --> 00:19:24.534
you had been planning
to escape Zhao Heizi?

00:19:26.015 --> 00:19:27.574
Zhao Heizi once said something.

00:19:29.175 --> 00:19:33.495
He said I was a bird with clipped wings,

00:19:34.975 --> 00:19:37.255
destined to be kept in a cage.

00:19:39.094 --> 00:19:40.735
If not by this person,

00:19:41.294 --> 00:19:42.895
then by that one.

00:19:43.895 --> 00:19:44.735
Two years ago,

00:19:45.574 --> 00:19:47.814
I thought getting rid of Lu Jun
meant freedom.

00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:52.935
I blamed all the suffering and hardship
of those seventeen years on him.

00:19:54.895 --> 00:19:56.495
I thought once I got rid of him,

00:19:57.054 --> 00:19:58.495
everything would be better.

00:19:59.255 --> 00:20:01.294
How did Zhao Heizi keep you around?

00:20:01.895 --> 00:20:02.814
Why didn't you leave?

00:20:06.255 --> 00:20:07.415
I was too tired

00:20:08.895 --> 00:20:09.975
to go anywhere.

00:20:11.814 --> 00:20:12.735
I told you.

00:20:13.695 --> 00:20:14.695
He treated me well.

00:20:15.495 --> 00:20:16.574
He was generous,

00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:19.774
and didn't try to take anything from me.

00:20:21.134 --> 00:20:22.695
At my age,

00:20:23.534 --> 00:20:24.895
with no family to rely on,

00:20:25.054 --> 00:20:25.975
no marriage,

00:20:26.574 --> 00:20:27.534
no job,

00:20:29.814 --> 00:20:30.975
and no children,

00:20:33.374 --> 00:20:35.614
I don't even know why I'm alive.

00:20:36.895 --> 00:20:39.695
Just living a meaningless life.
Don't you think so?

00:20:40.015 --> 00:20:43.574
Did Zhao Heizi really beat you?

00:20:44.655 --> 00:20:45.334
No.

00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:48.134
He never beat me.

00:20:49.015 --> 00:20:50.334
I lied to Lu Jun.

00:20:51.294 --> 00:20:54.294
Why did you have Lu Jun kill Zhao Heizi?

00:20:58.695 --> 00:20:59.534
Why?

00:21:02.015 --> 00:21:03.294
He forced me to.

00:21:04.655 --> 00:21:06.374
Once when Zhao Heizi was drunk,

00:21:07.534 --> 00:21:09.215
he said that I miscarried two years ago

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:12.334
because he told Lu Jun
I wanted to run away.

00:21:13.455 --> 00:21:15.735
He told Lu Jun
I was carrying another man's child

00:21:15.735 --> 00:21:17.935
and won't live properly with him.

00:21:19.895 --> 00:21:21.895
But that child was Lu Jun's.

00:21:23.175 --> 00:21:24.895
I don't care about others.

00:21:25.495 --> 00:21:26.614
But Lu Jun didn't trust me.

00:21:30.175 --> 00:21:34.054
Don't you think it's his retribution?

00:21:37.895 --> 00:21:38.695
Let's go.

00:21:38.695 --> 00:21:39.334
I'm off.

00:21:39.534 --> 00:21:40.175
Alright.

00:21:56.415 --> 00:21:57.134
I'm off, Ye.

00:21:57.415 --> 00:21:58.015
Let's go.

00:22:13.054 --> 00:22:13.695
Qian.

00:22:14.455 --> 00:22:15.015
Time for food.

00:22:16.495 --> 00:22:17.134
Let's go.

00:22:24.895 --> 00:22:25.495
Let's go.

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:53.464
(Dan Qing)

00:23:27.895 --> 00:23:30.215
This place clearly doesn't
get many visitors.

00:23:30.574 --> 00:23:31.655
Two types of footprints.

00:23:31.655 --> 00:23:32.415
Both fresh.

00:23:32.655 --> 00:23:34.814
One is from sneakers,
and the other is from flip-flops.

00:23:40.294 --> 00:23:42.015
The sneakers are about size 44.

00:23:42.015 --> 00:23:44.215
The flip-flops are about size 42.

00:23:46.054 --> 00:23:47.975
Based on stride length
and gait characteristics,

00:23:49.054 --> 00:23:50.215
both belong to males.

00:23:51.054 --> 00:23:53.304
But only the flip-flop prints
are left on the way back.

00:23:56.574 --> 00:23:57.655
Two types of footprints.

00:23:58.415 --> 00:23:59.215
Homicide?

00:24:12.294 --> 00:24:16.175
Starting from the stairwell, flip-flop
prints show steady forward movement.

00:24:16.175 --> 00:24:19.374
While the sneaker prints
show slow backward movement.

00:24:19.374 --> 00:24:22.455
This continued until the victim
was forced back to the roof edge.

00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:24.895
Only then did the flip-flop prints stop.

00:24:34.054 --> 00:24:35.455
This railing isn't short.

00:24:35.895 --> 00:24:36.935
It's quite sturdy too.

00:24:40.015 --> 00:24:43.814
The chance of accidentally falling
during shoving isn't high.

00:24:45.334 --> 00:24:47.334
The two types of prints aren't chaotic.

00:24:47.334 --> 00:24:49.175
No struggle or fight between them.

00:24:54.374 --> 00:24:57.534
The sneaker prints
suddenly vanish at the roof edge.

00:25:04.015 --> 00:25:04.895
From this perspective,

00:25:04.895 --> 00:25:06.935
the victim was likely lifted
by the person in flip-flops

00:25:06.935 --> 00:25:08.054
and pushed down from here.

00:25:09.334 --> 00:25:10.895
The victim was a grown man.

00:25:11.695 --> 00:25:15.814
How could such a young man be lifted
onto the railing and pushed down

00:25:15.935 --> 00:25:18.574
without resisting or struggling?

00:25:30.294 --> 00:25:31.895
No fingerprints on the railing.

00:25:32.094 --> 00:25:33.415
Combined with the footprints,

00:25:35.294 --> 00:25:38.655
the victim was likely pushed down
after losing the ability to resist.

00:25:55.735 --> 00:25:58.294
This should be fiber
from some kind of clothing.

00:25:59.854 --> 00:26:01.735
No weathering or fading.

00:26:02.655 --> 00:26:04.094
It was likely left recently.

00:26:05.574 --> 00:26:07.574
The victim wasn't wearing
fabric of this color.

00:26:08.534 --> 00:26:09.895
The fiber came from someone else.

00:26:11.935 --> 00:26:13.054
I'll examine it at the lab.

00:26:36.134 --> 00:26:39.640
Skin, bones, internal organs, and many
other tissue and organ injuries.

00:26:39.774 --> 00:26:42.175
Epidermal damage is minor,
but there's internal bleeding.

00:26:42.175 --> 00:26:44.935
Specifics will be clear
after the autopsy back at the lab.

00:26:45.134 --> 00:26:46.774
Looks like a fall from height.

00:26:47.495 --> 00:26:50.534
But we can't confirm
it's a suicide, homicide,

00:26:50.614 --> 00:26:51.574
or an accident.

00:27:04.534 --> 00:27:05.334
Wait.

00:27:08.495 --> 00:27:09.294
What's up?

00:27:14.134 --> 00:27:15.534
It really is this kid.

00:27:16.374 --> 00:27:17.175
You know him?

00:27:17.655 --> 00:27:20.695
He's the one who poisoned the dogs.

00:27:21.094 --> 00:27:23.334
His name is Liu... Liu Xiaofeng.

00:27:26.935 --> 00:27:28.175
I got a call from Captain Leng.

00:27:28.175 --> 00:27:29.015
It startled me.

00:27:29.294 --> 00:27:31.294
Did Liu Xiaofeng jump to kill himself?

00:27:31.495 --> 00:27:32.495
Seriously?

00:27:33.175 --> 00:27:34.735
We can't be completely sure yet.

00:27:35.495 --> 00:27:37.814
Were you the one handling
Liu Xiaofeng's case before?

00:27:38.054 --> 00:27:39.054
Not really a case.

00:27:39.054 --> 00:27:39.895
Just a civil dispute.

00:27:40.774 --> 00:27:42.175
You know Jiao and his wife well.

00:27:42.175 --> 00:27:43.294
You might hear about it.

00:27:43.614 --> 00:27:46.975
Liu Xiaofeng was a proper graduate
from a prestigious university.

00:27:47.895 --> 00:27:49.935
He couldn't find a job,
so he just stayed at home.

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:52.935
And it lasted for years.
His parents could do nothing with him.

00:27:54.334 --> 00:27:56.534
His parents divorced
when he was very young.

00:27:56.695 --> 00:27:58.134
Liu Xiaofeng lived with his mom.

00:27:59.015 --> 00:28:01.094
He came to the station twice
dealing with incidents.

00:28:01.094 --> 00:28:02.574
And his mom also came too.

00:28:03.534 --> 00:28:04.614
How to put it?

00:28:05.814 --> 00:28:07.215
You'll know when you see.

00:28:07.374 --> 00:28:07.854
Let's go.

00:28:12.735 --> 00:28:14.374
Yes, right upstairs.

00:28:14.374 --> 00:28:14.975
Let's go.

00:28:17.695 --> 00:28:18.294
Mr. Cao.

00:28:18.415 --> 00:28:21.495
Based on your understanding,
would Liu Xiaofeng offend anyone?

00:28:22.015 --> 00:28:23.294
Of course.

00:28:24.294 --> 00:28:25.935
Just from the dog poisoning incidents,

00:28:26.134 --> 00:28:29.215
several owners hated his guts.

00:28:30.134 --> 00:28:34.534
But they probably won't
go after him over a dog.

00:28:34.975 --> 00:28:36.695
Like Jiao, they didn't
make him compensate.

00:28:36.935 --> 00:28:38.374
A few owners demanded compensation.

00:28:39.534 --> 00:28:40.455
Was it a lot?

00:28:40.574 --> 00:28:41.374
Not much.

00:28:42.215 --> 00:28:44.054
His family isn't well off.

00:28:44.374 --> 00:28:46.975
After learning about his situation,
everyone was understanding.

00:28:47.695 --> 00:28:50.175
We gave him a lecture
and he wrote a guarantee letter,

00:28:50.334 --> 00:28:52.094
promising he'd never do it again.

00:28:52.374 --> 00:28:54.134
Then this case was considered closed.

00:28:55.374 --> 00:28:56.175
This way, come on.

00:29:01.534 --> 00:29:02.334
Anyone home?

00:29:03.574 --> 00:29:04.374
Anyone home?

00:29:06.334 --> 00:29:07.015
Who is it?

00:29:09.374 --> 00:29:11.134
Why are you here again?

00:29:11.735 --> 00:29:13.215
My son hasn't caused any trouble.

00:29:14.374 --> 00:29:15.334
Here's the thing.

00:29:15.614 --> 00:29:19.334
He signed letters of understanding
with several dog owners before.

00:29:19.534 --> 00:29:21.455
We have to conduct a follow-up visit

00:29:21.495 --> 00:29:22.334
and get more details.

00:29:22.935 --> 00:29:25.814
Don't falsely blame my son
for everything.

00:29:26.175 --> 00:29:27.774
He has been very well-behaved lately.

00:29:27.774 --> 00:29:28.935
He never sets foot outside.

00:29:28.935 --> 00:29:30.215
He's been surfing the internet

00:29:30.215 --> 00:29:31.495
and hasn't gone out at all.

00:29:32.215 --> 00:29:33.215
Liu Xiaofeng is home?

00:29:36.495 --> 00:29:37.215
Don't believe it?

00:29:38.614 --> 00:29:39.935
Come in and see for yourselves.

00:29:40.774 --> 00:29:42.574
Why are you so idle?

00:29:42.574 --> 00:29:43.935
Always causing me trouble.

00:29:47.094 --> 00:29:47.895
Come in.

00:29:51.134 --> 00:29:51.935
Xiaofeng.

00:29:52.814 --> 00:29:53.614
Xiaofeng.

00:29:55.415 --> 00:29:56.334
Liu Xiaofeng, hear me?

00:29:56.334 --> 00:29:57.134
Get out now!

00:30:13.255 --> 00:30:14.534
The victim is Liu Xiaofeng,

00:30:14.935 --> 00:30:16.935
male, twenty-seven years old,

00:30:17.134 --> 00:30:17.935
a local.

00:30:18.774 --> 00:30:21.574
The coroner confirmed the cause
of death was a fall from height.

00:30:21.975 --> 00:30:24.495
Time of death was around midnight
on the night of the crime.

00:30:28.374 --> 00:30:30.215
A contusion's on the back of his head.

00:30:30.294 --> 00:30:31.735
It doesn't match a fall from height.

00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:33.534
It's judged to be an ante-mortem injury.

00:30:34.872 --> 00:30:35.415
(Suspect's footprints found
on the roof of Zijing Apartment.)

00:30:35.415 --> 00:30:38.735
Combined with clues found on the roof
like footprints and scrape marks,

00:30:39.334 --> 00:30:42.175
we suspect he was struck on the back
of the head and unconscious,

00:30:42.175 --> 00:30:43.735
and then thrown from the building.

00:30:44.814 --> 00:30:48.334
The injury on the back of his head
and no signs of a struggle at the scene.

00:30:48.935 --> 00:30:50.776
We suspect the perpetrator
was an acquaintance.

00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:52.854
By the way,

00:30:53.495 --> 00:30:55.695
the red fibers found
at the scene are polyester.

00:30:56.094 --> 00:30:57.215
Their source is unknown.

00:31:00.215 --> 00:31:02.735
What about Liu Xiaofeng's social circle?

00:31:03.814 --> 00:31:05.334
Based on his family's feedback

00:31:05.334 --> 00:31:08.094
and our investigation
of the victim's phone contacts,

00:31:08.294 --> 00:31:10.534
Liu Xiaofeng's social circle
was quite limited.

00:31:10.774 --> 00:31:12.814
Indeed, as his mother said,

00:31:12.814 --> 00:31:14.215
he lived a rather solitary life.

00:31:14.334 --> 00:31:15.695
He had few contact with others.

00:31:15.774 --> 00:31:18.534
No valuable leads were found
among his existing social circle.

00:31:19.895 --> 00:31:22.215
Have you checked those dog owners?

00:31:22.334 --> 00:31:23.255
Still screening them.

00:31:23.255 --> 00:31:25.215
But nothing valuable
has been found so far.

00:31:26.695 --> 00:31:29.094
Forensic unit cracked
Liu Xiaofeng's computer password

00:31:30.215 --> 00:31:32.175
and found an internal forum email.

00:31:32.895 --> 00:31:34.215

The email content was simple.

00:31:34.735 --> 00:31:36.015
Zijing Apartment rooftop,

00:31:36.614 --> 00:31:37.695
which is the crime scene.

00:31:38.534 --> 00:31:41.774
It was sent at 10 PM
the night before the crime.

00:31:44.814 --> 00:31:46.574
Can you trace the sender?

00:31:48.374 --> 00:31:52.134
Currently, we only know this username
was randomly generated by the system.

00:31:52.774 --> 00:31:54.015
This forum is quite old,

via the login IP address.

is at her registered address.

is another issue.

00:40:49.335 --> 00:40:50.415
The key issue now is

00:40:50.654 --> 00:40:52.134
the explosion started at your house

00:40:52.455 --> 00:40:54.254
and the blast originated in your room.

00:40:54.254 --> 00:40:55.574
It has nothing to do with others.

00:40:57.295 --> 00:40:58.495
I rented that room out.

00:40:58.495 --> 00:41:00.015
Then ask your tenant

00:41:00.455 --> 00:41:01.214
if he stored

00:41:01.214 --> 00:41:02.694
any flammable materials in your room.

00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:04.295
Let me tell you.

00:41:04.534 --> 00:41:06.375
Fortunately, no one was hurt this time.

00:41:06.614 --> 00:41:07.815
If something serious happened,

00:41:07.815 --> 00:41:09.614
you'd share liability as the landlord.

00:41:10.455 --> 00:41:11.694
I want to reach him too.

00:41:11.694 --> 00:41:13.455
But he won't answer my calls.

00:41:14.574 --> 00:41:15.495
CID.

00:41:15.654 --> 00:41:16.174
Hello.

00:41:16.174 --> 00:41:17.495
An explosion? What happened?

00:41:17.775 --> 00:41:18.614
We're still checking.

00:41:18.614 --> 00:41:21.015
Probably because of flammable materials.

00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:25.174
That's my tenant's girlfriend.

00:41:26.254 --> 00:41:27.054
Are you sure?

00:41:27.734 --> 00:41:29.614
Yes. I've seen her before.

00:41:29.895 --> 00:41:30.694
I recognize her.
