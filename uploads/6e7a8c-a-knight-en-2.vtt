WEBVTT

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.849
You might not remember him, but...

00:00:16.474 --> 00:00:19.184
Stay there. I'm coming back.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.478
...he was a true knight.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:25.233
Different than other men. Yeah.

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.154
He had a peaceable nature.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.073
Quiet and humble.

00:00:33.074 --> 00:00:35.827
A veteran of a hundred wars,
but an enemy to none.

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:42.000
He always knew what was expected of him.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:45.211
He never complained.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:50.925
Even as he was dying, he just...

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.929
He just got on with it.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:01.061
He meant to be a benefit
to those around him.

00:01:03.688 --> 00:01:05.231
It did not make him rich.

00:01:06.107 --> 00:01:10.111
He held no lands, sired no children.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:14.198
Off to Ashford to see a fair maid

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:16.450
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:20.037
I'll make her my love
and we'll rest in the shade

00:01:20.038 --> 00:01:21.955
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

00:01:21.956 --> 00:01:23.124
Come on, Dunk!

00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.549
He wanted for nothing but the open air.

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.717
Hey.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.804
And a fire to warm his feet at.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.106
His skills as a warrior were...

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:51.610
unsung, but he had
a chin cut from granite.

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.072
- Come on.
- And he was a dogged fighter.

00:01:54.697 --> 00:01:56.658
He just, he kept on coming.

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:09.211
I'll steal a sweet kiss
from the point of my blade

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:11.714
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.469
Whoa! Whoa!

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:27.312
House Florent, Ser Arlan
took service in your guard

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.273
when your lord father lost his sight.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:32.192
I'll make her my love
and we'll rest in the shade

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.528
Heigh-ho, heigh-ho

00:02:34.529 --> 00:02:36.280
House Hayford,

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.742
Ser Arlan fought side by side
with your brothers at the Redgrass.

00:02:41.703 --> 00:02:45.206
His squire, his own nephew
was killed in the battle.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.210
House Tyrell...

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.421
Ser Arlan often spoke
of his time in your service

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.175
as his very finest.

00:02:56.384 --> 00:03:00.721
He said it was you, m'lord,
who told him that a hedge knight

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.183
was the bridge between lords
and the smallfolk.

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:09.689
I know him not, man.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:13.817
Was he a shit knight?

00:03:13.818 --> 00:03:15.319
He was not a shit knight.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.071
Well, he can't have been a very good one
if no one remembers him.

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:19.948
Pick up your feet, come on.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.451
This is undignified, ser.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.162
So, hie back to camp
and leave me be, if it please you.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.039
I would not leave you, ser,

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.208
not while you must
suffer your master dying

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.834
over and over again.

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:32.628
Though it does not seem like these lords

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.297
are even listening to you.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:36.925
Nothing I can do about that.

00:03:37.634 --> 00:03:39.552
You are a knight of the realm, ser.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.970
You can say fuck their permission.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.264
Ride into the lists,
call out Longthorn Tyrell,

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.476
and turn his arsehole into a lance-hole.

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:49.811
That's enough now.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:53.315
Why do you treat these royal lapdogs
like they're your betters?

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:56.986
They are my betters.
You're too brazen for your own good.

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.323
Ser Arlan was a great knight.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.700
Someone will remember him.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.331
Hey. Who's come?

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.542
Can't you see the banners, you giant cunt?

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:24.888
Perhaps I should go back,
ser, check on the camp.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.975
Make sure no thieves
have been nosing about.

00:04:28.893 --> 00:04:30.519
Aye. I have an idea.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.646
Can I have your sword
to run people off with?

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.731
- Or a mace?
- You have a knife.

00:04:34.732 --> 00:04:36.149
That's enough.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.360
You'd best be here when I come back.

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:41.446
Rob me, and I'll hunt you down, with dogs.

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.657
- You don't have dogs.
- I'll get some.

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:44.784
Where?

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:04.094
Our Lord of Ashford
humbly welcomes the great and honorable

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:08.474
Baelor Targaryen,
firstborn son of King Daeron the Good.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:13.521
Prince of Dragonstone,
Hand of the King...

00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.608
and heir to the Iron Throne.

00:05:19.485 --> 00:05:21.862
And his brother, Maekar.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.155
My Lord of Ashford.

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:25.365
It's a great honor to receive Your Grace.

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:26.700
It's a great honor to be received.

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.411
My daughter, Gwin.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.089
Boy, stop gaping. See to my horse.

00:05:41.841 --> 00:05:43.801
I'm not a stable boy, m'lord.

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:46.763
Not clever enough?

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:52.059
Well, if you can't manage horses,

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.645
then fetch me some wine
and a pretty wench.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:59.776
Oh, m'lord pardons.
I'm no serving man, either.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.655
I have the honor to be a knight.

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:09.285
Oh. Well...

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.830
knighthood has fallen on sad days.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.670
Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa.

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:22.631
- Move away!
- Easy.

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:24.466
Easy now, come on.

00:06:24.467 --> 00:06:27.095
Come on. Yeah, it's okay. It's okay.

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.893
There you are, girl.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.187
Far too many people around.

00:06:37.188 --> 00:06:39.022
I agree.

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:41.691
Where the fuck am I meant
to put all these horses?

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:43.861
The pretty ones are always temperamental.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:47.239
Ah, she just got a bit excited,
that's all.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.492
He meant the princeling, not the palfrey.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:53.955
Excuse me, m'lords.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.790
I'm Ser Duncan the Tall.

00:06:56.791 --> 00:06:58.667
Well met.
I'm Ser Roland Crakehall,

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:01.086
and this is my sworn brother,
Ser Donnel of Duskendale.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.546
Gods, boy.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.631
Do you ride your horse into battle
or does it ride you?

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:06.550
Forgive Ser Roland.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:10.095
It's not often he must look up
to cast his eyes down.

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.806
Yes, yes, I'm quite the rascal.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:13.807
Now, tell me, Ser Duncan,

00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:15.893
is there a proper place
to shit around here?

00:07:16.894 --> 00:07:18.438
Not really, no.

00:07:22.942 --> 00:07:26.404
A man of such birth has never deigned
to disturb his arsehole with hay.

00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.574
He'll deign before
the week is out, I'd wager.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:32.659
Where are you from, man?

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.911
You don't smell House-bred.

00:07:35.538 --> 00:07:38.082
- No place, really.
- I know it.

00:07:38.958 --> 00:07:40.542
My family's from there.

00:07:40.543 --> 00:07:42.962
You're not a Darklyn of Duskendale?

00:07:43.963 --> 00:07:46.006
We were crabbers at Duskendale.

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.758
Far back as it goes.

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.511
Ser Donnel?

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:55.724
May I ask, ser, how the son of a crabber

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:58.644
came to have the honor of being a knight
in the Kingsguard?

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:01.689
Same way we became crabbers.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:07.986
"Same way we became..."

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:10.114
Are you Baelor Targaryen?

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:12.657
No.

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.576
Then would you move
the fuck out of the way?

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:16.954
Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Apologies.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.291
Sorry.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.585
The princes be needing
their fucking hands washed!

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:25.671
I'm on my way, ma'am.

00:08:30.092 --> 00:08:32.136
Move! A carriage is comin' through!

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:58.787
The spring rains have swollen
many of our streams.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.039
Perhaps the young princes
have just been delayed?

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.415
Fuck me.

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:04.626
"Delayed." They're not delayed.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:06.586
Do not curse our gracious host.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:08.672
I said "fuck me," not "fuck him."

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:12.176
It's not his fault Father bade us
attend this miserable circus.

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:14.970
Might we discuss this another time?

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.596
I say we go hunting.

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:18.558
Daeron has done this before.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:21.519
You should not have commanded him
to enter the lists.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.480
The prince's sons are missing.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.399
You'd be more concerned
if it was your son, I wager.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.193
- Oh.
- Probably dead.

00:09:30.194 --> 00:09:32.613
- Dead?
- Wars have started for less.

00:09:37.535 --> 00:09:38.995
You're big and stupid.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:46.419
They have only been missing a day.

00:09:47.545 --> 00:09:50.339
No doubt, Ser Roland will turn him up
and Aegon along with him.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.008
When the tourney is over, perhaps.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:54.759
Daeron belongs on a tourney field

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.554
no more than Aerys or Rhaegel.

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.015
By which you mean he'd sooner
ride a whore than a horse.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.601
That is not what I said.

00:10:05.146 --> 00:10:07.939
I do not need to be reminded
of my son's failings.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.483
He can change.
He will change, gods be damned.

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:13.070
Or I swear, I'll see him dead.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.116
You.

00:10:17.950 --> 00:10:20.870
Who are you?
What do you mean by spying on us?

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.123
Show yourself.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:33.424
My Lords, I do apologize
for my interruption. I...

00:10:36.552 --> 00:10:38.261
I have asked Ser Manfred Dondarrion

00:10:38.262 --> 00:10:41.097
to vouch for me so that I might
enter the lists,

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:43.142
- but he has refused to do so.
- Who?

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:45.435
What the fuck is going on?

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:48.564
We are the intruders here, brother.
Come closer, ser.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.443
And others, too.

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:57.322
You see, they say they know not
Ser Arlan of Pennytree.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:11:00.158
But he served them. I swear it.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:01.994
I have his sword and shield.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.663
Sword and shield do not make a knight.

00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:05.665
Mm?

00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:11.419
Unless you have better proof
to support what you say.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.964
- Some writing or--
- Do you remember him, Your Grace?

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:18.718
It was many years ago.

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:20.262
You may have forgotten.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:26.018
Ser Arlan of Pennytree.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.439
He never won a tourney that I know.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:33.191
But he never shamed himself, either.

00:11:33.192 --> 00:11:34.901
Yes, ser.

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:36.945
I mean, no. No, he didn't.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:40.532
He overthrew Lord Stokeworth
in the melee at King's Landing

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.867
and years before,
he unhorsed the Grey Lion himself.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.079
He told me of that many a time.

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:49.583
Then, you will recall
the Grey Lion's true name,

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:51.752
I have no doubt.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.595
Ser Damon Lannister.

00:12:02.596 --> 00:12:05.223
The Grey Lion,
he's Lord of Casterly Rock now.

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:06.975
So he is.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:08.977
And enters the lists upon the morrow.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.771
How can you possibly remember
some fucking hedge knight

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:15.400
who chanced to unhorse
Damon Lannister 16 years ago?

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:17.902
I make it a practice to learn
all I can of my foes.

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:20.363
And why would you deign
to joust with a hedge knight?

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:22.699
It was many years past, at Storm's End.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.661
Lord Baratheon held a hastilude
to celebrate the birth of a grandson.

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:29.081
The lots made Ser Arlan
my opponent in the first tilt.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:32.333
We broke four lances
before I finally unhorsed him.

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:33.502
It was seven.

00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:39.841
I believe.

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:41.343
Tales grow in the telling, I know.

00:12:43.721 --> 00:12:47.682
Do not think ill of your old master,
but it was four lances only, I fear.

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.476
As you say, Your Grace.

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:51.436
It was four. I do apologize.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.897
The old man, Ser Arlan, he used to say

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.900
that I was thick as a castle wall
and slow as an aurochs.

00:12:56.901 --> 00:12:58.486
No harm was done, ser. Rise.

00:13:01.447 --> 00:13:04.992
You gave him back his horse and armor
and took no ransom.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:09.245
Ser Arlan often told me that
you were the soul of chivalry...

00:13:09.246 --> 00:13:10.580
- Ugh.
- ...and that one day,

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:13.750
the Seven Kingdoms
would be safe in your hands.

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.127
Not for many years yet, I pray.

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:19.172
No, I did not mean
that the King should--

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:20.507
You wish to enter the lists.

00:13:20.508 --> 00:13:21.842
Is that it?

00:13:22.843 --> 00:13:24.302
- Yes.
- The decision rests

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:27.180
with the master of the games,
but I see no reason to deny you.

00:13:27.181 --> 00:13:28.766
As you say, m'lord.

00:13:30.267 --> 00:13:31.268
Mm.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:33.228
Your Grace--

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.356
Very well, ser, You are grateful.
Now, fuck off!

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:38.233
You must forgive my brother, ser.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.319
His sons went astray on the way here,
and he fears for them.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.696
Of course.

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:45.282
I trust they will not be found dead.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:58.170
Ser.

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.716
You are not of Ser Arlan's blood?

00:14:04.635 --> 00:14:05.845
No, I am not.

00:14:07.137 --> 00:14:10.515
By law, only a trueborn son
is entitled to inherit a knight's arms.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.810
You must needs find a new device, ser.

00:14:13.602 --> 00:14:14.854
A sigil of your own.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:17.648
I will.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:21.235
Thank you again, Your Grace.

00:14:23.237 --> 00:14:26.282
I will fight bravely. You'll see.

00:14:32.746 --> 00:14:33.872
It's this way.

00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.124
You are no knight.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:42.714
You are Florian the Fool.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.675
I am, my lady.

00:14:46.135 --> 00:14:48.012
As great a fool as ever lived.

00:14:51.765 --> 00:14:54.476
And as great a knight as well!

00:14:59.231 --> 00:15:01.400
A fool and a knight.

00:15:02.318 --> 00:15:04.777
I have never heard of such a thing.

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:06.613
Sweet lady.

00:15:06.614 --> 00:15:09.325
All men are fools,
and all men are knights...

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:11.619
...where women are concerned.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.508
Hello there.

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.846
And one for last night.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.056
That was great.

00:15:33.057 --> 00:15:35.308
How'd you do the fire tricks?

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:36.560
Oh.

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.815
Is it pollen?

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:45.361
Yeah, we collect it on the way.

00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:50.949
I've never seen such giant puppets.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.283
Do you make them yourself?

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:55.329
My uncle builds them, but I paint.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:57.998
Could you paint something for me?

00:15:58.999 --> 00:16:02.753
I have the coin to pay. I just...

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:07.256
I need to paint
something over the chalice.

00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:09.843
Well, what would you want?

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.014
I...

00:16:15.015 --> 00:16:17.308
I don't actually know.

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:18.310
I...

00:16:19.478 --> 00:16:21.729
Sorry, you must think me a fool.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.358
All men are fools,
and all men are knights.

00:16:26.318 --> 00:16:27.319
Mm.

00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:33.951
Yeah.

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:38.454
The gray is a bit drab.

00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:39.456
Aye.

00:16:40.958 --> 00:16:44.044
Yeah, the field should be
the color of sunset

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.505
'cause the old man
always liked sunsets and...

00:16:47.506 --> 00:16:49.757
An elm tree. A big one.

00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:52.552
Like the one by the river
with the brown trunk

00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:55.013
and the green branches.

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:57.975
Aye. An elm tree, that would serve.

00:16:58.976 --> 00:17:00.894
But with a shooting star above.

00:17:01.895 --> 00:17:03.939
- Could you do that?
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:08.694
Thank you, I'm Ser Duncan the Tall.

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.572
I'm Tanselle.

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:15.868
The boys used to call me
Tanselle Too-Tall.

00:17:17.327 --> 00:17:19.580
You're not too tall.
I mean, you're just right for...

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:23.834
For?

00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:26.170
Puppets.

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:28.922
Yeah, puppets.

00:17:30.174 --> 00:17:31.340
Okay, I'll...

00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:33.384
- Wait. The shield.
- Yes, sorry.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.594
- Yes, the shield.
- Yeah.

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:35.929
Was that ill-handled?

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:39.099
- Hm?
- The puppet girl.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.226
Oh.

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:45.314
It didn't feel well-handled.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:48.524
She is painting your shield.

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:49.860
Yeah, for pay.

00:17:52.279 --> 00:17:54.156
You are both gigantic.

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:00.162
Is that promising?

00:18:01.413 --> 00:18:02.623
It's a...

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:05.501
commonality.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:09.671
Right, yeah. Commonality.

00:18:11.298 --> 00:18:12.341
I don't know.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:19.681
Do you think I'll ever make
a knight one day?

00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:22.892
Sure, why not? You're a likely lad.

00:18:22.893 --> 00:18:24.977
I'm a bit puny.

00:18:24.978 --> 00:18:27.396
- You'll grow.
- Even for my age.

00:18:27.397 --> 00:18:29.024
Everyone's always told me so.

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.863
Everyone's always told me I was stupid.

00:18:43.872 --> 00:18:44.873
And?

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:46.917
Hm?

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:49.503
- Hm? What?
- What?

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.674
What did you do when people
said you were stupid, ser?

00:18:55.217 --> 00:18:56.844
What business is that of yours?

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.220
My problems are my own.

00:18:59.221 --> 00:19:00.763
I thought...

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:02.265
Aren't you trying to help me?

00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.392
Help you what? Grow?

00:19:04.393 --> 00:19:05.769
Yes! Hedge knight, you.

00:19:08.438 --> 00:19:10.691
What is this piss froth? I need muscle.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.777
Will you heed my call to war?

00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:16.320
Aha! Good.

00:19:16.321 --> 00:19:17.822
Go! Get up, come.

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:20.075
Ready!

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:25.329
Hey! Dry those palms,
you clam-handed cunt.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:27.498
We're not in your sister's chambers now.

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:29.126
Ready?

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:33.755
- Go!
- Pull!

00:19:34.631 --> 00:19:37.550
If we lose this,
I'll be drowning your firstborn!

00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:39.343
- Come on!
- Pull! Pull!

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:42.347
Pull, you cunt-strapped dandelions!

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.732
I'll be back. I'll be back! I'll be back.

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:54.525
Lyonel! What are you doing?

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:56.320
- I'm thirsty.
- Lyonel!

00:19:57.988 --> 00:19:59.448
Pull!

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:03.202
I'm thirsty, cunt.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.873
I'm thirsty!

00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:12.753
Looking good.

00:20:20.093 --> 00:20:22.888
Fucking pull!

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:54.127
- You do good work.
- None better.

00:20:56.797 --> 00:20:58.382
I need some armor on the morrow.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:02.927
Gorget, greaves, and great helm.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:04.304
Are you jousting or working?

00:21:05.514 --> 00:21:06.515
Both, perhaps.

00:21:10.477 --> 00:21:13.355
You're a big one,
though I've armored bigger.

00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:20.486
I have some pieces
in the wagon that might do.

00:21:20.487 --> 00:21:23.781
Nothing prettied up
with gold or silver, like.

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:27.034
Just good steel, strong and plain.

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:31.623
I make helms that look like helms,
not winged pigs and fancy foreign fruit.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:36.377
But mine'll serve you better
if you take a lance in the face.

00:21:36.378 --> 00:21:39.422
That's all I want. How much?

00:21:39.423 --> 00:21:42.466
Eight hundred stag,
for I'm feeling kindly.

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:43.844
Eight hundred?

00:21:45.846 --> 00:21:48.389
Perhaps I could trade you some
armor made for a smaller man.

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:50.725
A half helm, a mail hauberk.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:53.729
Steely Pate sells only his own work.

00:22:08.452 --> 00:22:09.786
I could make use of the metal.

00:22:10.912 --> 00:22:14.374
If it's not too rusted,
I'll take it and armor you for...

00:22:16.043 --> 00:22:17.210
600.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:21.213
I only have two stags.

00:22:21.214 --> 00:22:23.050
Buys you a day.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.304
Send your squire along with the rest,

00:22:28.305 --> 00:22:30.515
or else I'll sell me wares
to the next man.

00:22:31.892 --> 00:22:33.602
You'll get it all back, I swear it.

00:22:34.811 --> 00:22:36.562
I mean to be a champion here.

00:22:36.563 --> 00:22:37.689
Do you, now?

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:41.610
And the others all came just...

00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:43.779
just to cheer you on?

00:23:03.048 --> 00:23:05.675
Is there any measure of a fool
I fail to meet?

00:23:12.182 --> 00:23:16.268
If I win, I'll come back
and buy you again.

00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:17.604
I promise.

00:23:20.857 --> 00:23:22.484
Best girl.

00:23:40.293 --> 00:23:41.628
That's for her.

00:23:44.005 --> 00:23:46.425
See she has some oats tonight, yeah?

00:23:54.307 --> 00:23:55.767
And an apple, too.

00:24:08.196 --> 00:24:09.948
No turning back now, I suppose.

00:24:17.956 --> 00:24:20.541
You know, the old man
lived nigh on 60 years

00:24:20.542 --> 00:24:23.044
- and was never a champion.
- There's a bug in my cider.

00:24:24.671 --> 00:24:27.716
If I could call myself
a champion of Ashford Meadow...

00:24:28.925 --> 00:24:30.510
even for an hour...

00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:35.140
maybe some great house
might take me into its service.

00:24:37.184 --> 00:24:39.227
Perhaps even House Targaryen.

00:24:41.062 --> 00:24:43.815
You suppose the dragon house
employs many hedge knights, ser?

00:24:44.816 --> 00:24:46.859
Enough of that.

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.069
I'll have you know
Ser Donnel of the Kingsguard

00:24:49.070 --> 00:24:50.864
is but the son of a crabber.

00:24:52.032 --> 00:24:53.699
Ser Donnel?

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.701
- Of Duskendale?
- Yeah.

00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:58.538
His father owns half
the crabbing fleets in Westeros.

00:24:59.748 --> 00:25:00.832
What?!

00:25:02.918 --> 00:25:04.127
How would you know?

00:25:05.045 --> 00:25:06.713
I like fishing.

00:25:12.052 --> 00:25:13.470
It's time!

00:25:14.888 --> 00:25:16.138
Right, come on, let's go.

00:25:16.139 --> 00:25:18.225
Come on, pick your feet up. Let's go.

00:25:23.313 --> 00:25:24.731
Wait for me!

00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:36.076
Ser Duncan!

00:25:37.827 --> 00:25:39.620
Oh.

00:25:39.621 --> 00:25:41.206
- You alright?
- Yeah.

00:26:18.034 --> 00:26:21.121
For the new gods and old!

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.260
Lance!

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:41.099
Shield, and lance.

00:26:47.897 --> 00:26:48.898
Helmet!

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.943
Hey, who's that?

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:55.405
Prince Valarr, Baelor's son.

00:26:56.615 --> 00:26:58.407
- Second in line to the throne.
- Shield!

00:26:58.408 --> 00:27:00.326
He's the favorite, I'd wager.

00:27:00.327 --> 00:27:01.786
I'll take that bet, ser.

00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:23.391
Lord Ashford fucks his sheep!

00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:46.081
Come on! Whoo!

00:27:51.795 --> 00:27:54.089
Squire! Lance, lance, lance!

00:28:10.605 --> 00:28:12.607
Ser. Put me down, ser.

00:28:22.617 --> 00:28:23.827
Hyah! Hyah!

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:36.923
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:09.246
Die!

00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.916
Do you yield, Blackfyre bastards?!

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:19.007
Splendid riding tonight.

00:29:21.885 --> 00:29:24.220
Mm, the part with the fish was disgusting.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:32.729
Something the matter, ser?

00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:41.988
Do great knights live in the hedges
and die by the side of a muddy road?

00:29:46.367 --> 00:29:47.660
I think not.

00:29:51.539 --> 00:29:54.374
Ser Arlan wasn't gifted
with sword or lance,

00:29:54.375 --> 00:30:00.131
and he drank, and he whored,
and he was a hard man to know.

00:30:03.676 --> 00:30:05.220
He made no friends, either.

00:30:06.262 --> 00:30:09.307
He lived nigh on 60 years
and never was a champion.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.728
Mm, what chance do I have? Truly?

00:30:17.273 --> 00:30:18.608
But he was good to me.

00:30:24.405 --> 00:30:25.990
I wasn't his family...

00:30:27.283 --> 00:30:28.910
but he kept me like we were.

00:30:33.873 --> 00:30:35.917
He raised me to be an honorable man.

00:30:39.754 --> 00:30:41.506
And all these

00:30:42.966 --> 00:30:46.010
noble lords can't even remember his name.

00:30:49.097 --> 00:30:51.307
His name was Ser Arlan of Pennytree.

00:30:53.184 --> 00:30:54.811
And I am his legacy.

00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:57.730
On the morrow...

00:30:59.482 --> 00:31:01.526
we will show them
what his hand has wrought.
