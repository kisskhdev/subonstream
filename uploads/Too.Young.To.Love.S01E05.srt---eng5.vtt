I'm still under a lot of pressure
because of my academic scores.

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:07.510
You can't think like that.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.510
We're not stupid.

00:11:09.270 --> 00:11:10.730
When did I say I was stupid?

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:14.510
You're so talented in art.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.870
For the art exam, people usually
hire tutors for focused guidance.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.330
If you work hard,
you'll definitely make it.

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.740
[Pre-filled College Application
Preference Form]

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.840
I know who to ask.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.270
I think

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.000
if you really want to learn,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.360
I'll introduce you

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.790
to a professional tutor.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:39.120
How about it?

00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:41.630
I guess that works.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.360
Shan.

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:50.850
Can I get admitted?

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:53.870
Don't worry about that yet.
Human effort is the decisive factor.

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:55.400
You have to work hard first.

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:00.440
Do you want to...

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.750
listen to...

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.950
my mentor's, i.e. your mom's...

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:08.670
wonderful performance.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:09.790
Yes.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.200
Let me see where it is.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.560
This one.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.000
My mom is amazing!

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.050
She truly deserves to be my mentor.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.120
So professional.

00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:41.630
Why didn't you let me listen earlier?

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:43.090
You didn't ask me earlier.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:44.800
My bad. I forgot.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.730
Since my mom is so amazing,

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.120
I can definitely make it too.

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.870
You definitely can.

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:52.630
I believe in you.

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:53.360
You can do it.

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.670
You continue to listen.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.480
The books have arrived.

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.410
I'll go get them.

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:03.000
Okay.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.630
Stop reading and watch the shop for me.

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:14.240
Got it.

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.750
Tong Xiaole.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:26.750
Can you do something useful?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.750
I deduce

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:36.640
that within 2 hours,

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.590
no one will come. So I'll read a bit more.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.870
Ning!

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:45.390
Mengmeng!

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.000
Come and listen to my mom's performance.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:50.360
Come.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:50.870
Hurry.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.400
Sit. Sit.

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:52.560
Listen. Listen.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:55.400
Chen Fan.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:00.360
Beg me.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.470
The first string, 4 fingers.

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.570
The second string, 3 fingers.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:13.600
The third string.

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:15.670
Back to the first string.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:18.790
Then to the second string.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.360
Your fingering is so nimble.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.060
With more practice, you can do it too.

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:28.750
Let me show you.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:29.450
Okay.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.600
Professor Ye Mei?

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:15.670
Hello.

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.150
I'm Luo Ningzi,
a senior from No. 2 High School.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.240
Could you please comment on my playing?

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:23.170
Your basic skills are quite solid.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:25.270
It's just that...

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.930
it lacks some emotions.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:30.120
If you want to improve further,

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:32.350
welcome to apply to Hailan University.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:33.840
Thank you.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:34.990
Keep it up.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:07.630
Shan.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:08.230
The books.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.700
Help me put the books back.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.070
Professor Ye.

00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:28.240
My name is Yi Lan.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.080
I'm Luo Ningzi's classmate.

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:32.480
I also really want
to get admitted to Hailan University

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.750
and become your student.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:35.010
I admire you very much.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.630
Show me your left hand.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:38.470
Left hand.

00:16:50.670 --> 00:16:52.070
Do you really like music,

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.150
or do you just want to use this hobby

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:55.150
to take the art exam

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.550
as a stepping stone
to get into university?

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.600
Music isn't a whim or a game.

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.630
It requires you to work really hard.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.829
Are you ready?

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.060
I'm going to my major class first.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:36.960
Ning.

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.640
Your hand...

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.440
It's nothing.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:43.880
The calluses have been rubbed raw.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.680
I'm used to it.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:46.100
I'm off.

00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:49.110
Ning, wait for me.

00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.480
Ning.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.220
Your performance just now was great.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.110
She said my playing

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.440
lacked emotions.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.600
Professor Ye isn't necessarily right
about everything.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.250
I need to find emotions.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.650
I think it was full of emotions!

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.640
Your dad's been busy outside these months.

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:45.100
I've been pretty busy too.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:46.440
Just take good care of yourself

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.770
and practice the cello.

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.530
Here, have an apple.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.830
Mom, I...

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.880
I know you don't like them,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:55.740
but they're good for your health.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.370
Thanks, Mom.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:03.550
Mom,

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:06.200
I went to Hailan University last week.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:08.400
Their music program is pretty good.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.260
If my study abroad application
doesn't go through,

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.170
I'll apply to this university.

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.720
No matter how good Hailan University is,

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.960
it still can't compare to going abroad
to polish your résumé.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.590
Don't worry about things at home.

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:21.920
Just focus on yourself.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:24.310
Mm.

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:25.550
Got it.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.700
I'm going to practice now.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.070
Mr. Bu.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.740
I understand all that.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:41.770
Yes, yes.

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:44.890
We're always too busy out of town.

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:46.880
Don't worry.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.210
We'll definitely communicate properly.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.610
What are you messing around with now?

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.570
Photos taken by Xiaole.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.300
Your class teacher contacted me.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.590
He said your grades are very good,

00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:13.480
and the school has high hopes for you.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.340
I don't know much
about top universities or majors.

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:17.880
What are your thoughts?

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.170
Then just put down Finance.

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:40.920
We never managed your studies before.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.100
But you're in senior year now.

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:46.590
From now on, your mom will stay at home
and take good care of you.

00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:48.920
You just focus on preparing for the exams.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.400
I...

00:20:55.790 --> 00:20:57.790
These photos taken by Xiaole
are pretty good.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.440
Look, Tong.

00:20:58.440 --> 00:20:59.370
Just take a look.

00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.960
Take a good look.

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:05.680
Mom.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.880
I'm fine.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.640
I can take good care of myself.

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.840
I think at this stage,

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.440
you two should just focus on making money.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:25.450
Xiaole, you really don't need me
to stay with you?

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.100
Then I'll go on a business trip
with your dad tomorrow morning.

00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.480
Mom,

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.400
I made plans with friends.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.530
I'm going out first.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:41.480
Come back early.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:45.590
Communicate properly?

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.450
Do you think that kid will listen?

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:50.160
He doesn't even know
how to respect us now.

00:21:50.550 --> 00:21:53.720
What's wrong? Shouldn't you
listen to our son's opinion on this?

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.920
When filling out high school applications,

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.160
you told me to let him do as he pleased.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.360
And he argued with me.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.240
Look at all his bad habits now.

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.790
And he has such a bad temper!

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:01.850
You're blaming me?

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.560
Was it me who spoiled him?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.680
Neither of us usually has time
to discipline him!

00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.590
After just a few years of schooling,
he started looking down

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:09.440
on his father for reeking of money, huh?

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.830
Look at how listless he is!

00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:12.640
What can he possibly do in the future?

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.550
Maybe I'll have to use my connections
to find him a job!

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:16.880
Why are you always yelling?

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.480
How are we supposed
to communicate like this?

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:20.880
On the matter of filling out applications,
shouldn't you listen to his opinion?

00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.010
I can't believe you.

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:24.830
You just never say anything nice.

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:33.680
The cello major at Hailan University.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.200
Sister,

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.240
if you get into the cello major,

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:49.030
you'll become a musician in the future.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.680
Stop playing and come eat first.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.170
The tuition is a bit expensive,

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.700
but I can work summer jobs.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.920
I can also work part-time in university
to earn tuition.

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.080
It's not about money.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.960
I don't agree.

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:13.290
Well...

00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:17.280
Let's eat first.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.300
[Bad news. My dad
doesn't agree with me learning the cello.]

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:31.630
[Wait for me at the usual place.]

00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.300
[When the sun goes down,
it's time to drink]

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:39.370
So? The place I found
is pretty good, right?

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:41.070
Tonight was
our first successful performance.

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.240
We must have a proper celebration feast.

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.300
I'll treat you to barbecue. Let's go.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.880
I'm a bit tired today.

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:48.000
Maybe next time.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.140
Next time, it's my treat.

00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:50.370
I'm leaving first.

00:23:50.550 --> 00:23:51.070
Bye bye.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:20.790
You scared me.

00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.480
Tell me.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:30.920
Why did you come

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.090
to your life mentor?

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.400
Just those things about my dad.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.280
He always says the same things.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.160
He said

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.640
he'll absolutely never support me

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.300
in taking the cello as a major.

00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:46.110
He also said there's no future
in learning the cello.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.040
I asked him why, and he always said,

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.400
"Eat first. That's enough."

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.540
Do you think so too?

00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:58.250
Why would I?

00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.960
Of course not.

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:05.240
But...

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.550
have you put in the effort?

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:08.240
Of course.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:15.160
It's just that
I haven't had professional training.

00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:16.890
So it's definitely not enough.

00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:19.240
Sometimes I'd think

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.030
if I put in 100% effort

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:24.590
and I still don't succeed in the end,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.350
my dad would surely be
very disappointed in me.

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:29.350
I'd also lose confidence in myself.

00:25:30.790 --> 00:25:31.440
Fine.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.480
Let me ask you.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.240
You said you want to play the cello.
How badly do you want it?

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.310
Even in my dreams.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.400
If it's something you dream about,

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.310
just do it.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:40.240
If you don't get admitted this year,

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:41.200
try again next year.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.640
Since it's something you dream about,

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.110
how can you give up so easily?

00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.790
Something you dream about

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:47.200
is called a dream.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.070
Dreams

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:50.960
are very important.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.140
I can't give up easily.

00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:05.590
You're teachable.

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.030
Then I need to plan properly

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.500
how to convince my dad.

00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:13.740
What about you?

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.160
Which university do you plan to apply to?

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.400
I don't need to take the art exam.

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.200
It's still early.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.640
You clearly don't know what to apply to,

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.790
yet you're lecturing me.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:21.790
Stop pretending.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:24.830
I am maturer than you.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.740
How about this?

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.830
You participate
in a photography competition

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:33.890
or create a photography account.

Oh.
