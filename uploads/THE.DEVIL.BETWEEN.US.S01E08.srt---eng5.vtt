[THE DEVIL BETWEEN US]

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.020
[Episode 8]

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:37.940
What are you doing?

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.370
It's for your own good.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.000
Whatever you want to ask,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we'll talk later.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.800
We'll take another route back later.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.329
Go.

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.720
Hurry.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.350
The police will be here soon.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.650
Drive your own car!

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.399
Split up and search!

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600
Get out of the car.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.829
Here!

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.240
Here!

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.920
Hurry.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.490
Don't fall asleep!

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.600
Is the ambulance here yet?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.360
Almost.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080
Where is Ding Lai?

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.760
He ran away.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.040
You take a car, I'll take another.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.760
We have to search outside.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.230
Okay.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.950
Okay, I'll keep an eye on the ambulance.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:34.480
Let's go!

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.690
The ambulance is here.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.600
We're going after Ding Lai now.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.040
Here!

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.680
Over here!

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.240
Hurry up!

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.800
Follow me!

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.680
Hurry up.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.800
You're off work early.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.870
Dad!

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.750
Xiaoyu,

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.700
Dad is back.

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.020
You can come out now.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:28.900
Xiaoyu.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.670
Stop!

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.160
He's not breathing anymore.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.640
What are you doing?

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.440
Get in the car.

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320
From now on,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.410
whatever we do,

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.300
we have to be extremely careful.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.360
Remember this—

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.340
if the police find out,

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.130
I'll take the fall for everything.

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:33.050
I'll tell them

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.720
I killed Ding Lai

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.150
out of jealousy

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.150
and revenge.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:39.630
It has nothing to do with you.

00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:43.710
This is all we can do.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.840
Leave the rest

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:48.480
to fate.

00:09:57.970 --> 00:09:59.330
Since when did you know?

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.780
Where is the phone I gave you?

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.590
I installed a mini-program in it.

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.460
I don't even want to talk about
Cheng Xiaodong.

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:25.860
I'm telling you,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:27.490
he's completely finished now—

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:28.820
obsessed with fishing.

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:30.760
And it's not enough for him

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.110
to go to a regular fishing spot anymore;

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.680
he even rents fishing boats.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.420
I'm definitely

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.450
getting a divorce.

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:37.690
Didn't you use to say

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.330
it's good for a man to have a hobby?

00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.530
She actually used to
support Cheng Xiaodong's fishing.

00:10:41.530 --> 00:10:43.670
I only said that before to save his face.

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.550
Let me tell you—

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.420
when a successful man goes fishing,

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:47.510
it's a hobby;

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.860
when a man with no career does it,

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.590
it's just aimless indulgence.

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:52.390
With a narcotics officer dead,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:53.620
going back to Haizhou to make money again

00:10:53.620 --> 00:10:54.790
is impossible now.

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:56.380
The best way

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:57.570
is to recruit Daquan

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:01.040
and use his distribution network
to make some quick cash.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.310
I'll send you a location later.

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:05.170
Bring the money and meet me there.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.440
Xiaoya,

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.670
give me a hug.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:14.780
Come on.

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.540
Turn around.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:19.340
If I get arrested

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:20.910
or die in some accident,

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:22.740
the police will find you

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:23.710
through this photo.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:25.170
You won't get away either.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.500
So what, do you want to die

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:30.120
and drag someone down with you?

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:42.310
You've been eavesdropping on me
this whole time?

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:43.310
Are you sick?

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:47.460
I just wanted to help you.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:54.670
So you knew everything

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.000
I've been doing lately.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.420
You knew Ding Lai was at my place,

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.790
you knew who he was,

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.860
but you never let it show.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:08.790
Didn't I ask you before

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:10.710
if there was another man?

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:12.370
You didn't answer.

00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.340
So I figured you didn't want to tell me.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:17.850
I decided to pretend I didn't know.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:18.560
It's okay.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:19.780
I don't care.

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:21.750
As long as you're happy,

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.190
I'm fine with anything.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:24.420
Are you insane?

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.340
Yes.

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.630
If loving you is a sickness,

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.590
then I have a terminal illness.

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:35.030
Cheng Xiaodong,

00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:38.080
I want to jump out of the car.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.600
I'm clumsy with words.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:42.820
I'm not a smooth talker like Ding Lai.

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.790
But my hands aren't clumsy.

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.440
I never thought
killing someone could be this easy.

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:07.740
Delete whatever you installed

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.550
on my phone.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.080
Forget it.

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.790
I'll just switch phones.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:19.800
If there's anything else
you're hiding from me,

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.730
tell me all of it.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:25.950
Do you remember

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:27.340
how we first met?

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:29.790
At a KTV,

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.790
my friend got drunk

00:13:31.930 --> 00:13:33.100
and walked into the wrong room.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.190
He argued with your colleagues,

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:37.670
and I went over to apologize.

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.820
That's how we met.

00:13:40.340 --> 00:13:41.270
Do you remember?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.650
Yes.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.290
I arranged all of that.

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:50.070
My friend wasn't drunk,

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.810
and I already knew your colleagues
back then.

00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:14.190
Why me?

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.440
At the time my startup had failed.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.520
I couldn't take it,

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.920
so I was going to jump into the sea.

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:29.980
"Smooth traffic on your way home,

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.100
an easy life always."

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.950
This is Nuanfeng County People's Radio,

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:34.280
the Voice of Nuanhai program.

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.440
I am your friend,

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.390
Xiaoya.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.420
Whether you're on your way home from work

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.460
or getting dinner ready at home,

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.610
I hope you can set aside
the burdens of a long day

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:47.400
and embrace the beautiful evening ahead.

00:14:48.190 --> 00:14:49.020
Yesterday,

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.440
a listener who goes by CXD

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.120
left a message on our forum.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.280
He said

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.370
that after graduating from college,

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.090
he used his family's money
to start a business,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.430
but it failed,

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.310
and now he feels like
there's no hope for the future.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:04.070
Actually,

00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:05.510
in the journey of life,

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.750
it's only natural to hit low points.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.820
So

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.670
I

00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.070
would like to send this friend

00:15:12.150 --> 00:15:13.390
a little encouragement.

00:15:13.390 --> 00:15:15.790
Life is about climbing

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:17.630
one hill after another.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.750
There's no valley you can't walk out of.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.310
This next song is for you.

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:24.390
I hope you'll

00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:26.390
try to love a little more,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:28.070
wait a little longer,

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.910
and keep traveling on through life—

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:31.940
just for

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:34.170

but I never imagined

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.119
you'd hide everything

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.540
this deeply.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:13.589
When I go night fishing,

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:16.599
I run into all kinds of anglers.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.690
I divide them into two types —

00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:22.839
those who

00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:27.119
sit there all night
thinking about nothing,

00:17:28.349 --> 00:17:29.220
and those

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.520
who sit there thinking all night.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:35.870
I'm the latter.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.030
I don't understand
all this nonsense you're saying.

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:46.640
I just want to ask you one thing—

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:48.260
will you always help me?

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.960
Yes.

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:51.740
What do you want?

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.520
Do you want to marry me again?

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:04.700
That depends on
whether you really want to.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:05.840
As long as you are happy,

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:06.840
anything is fine.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:14.870
If I say I don't want to,

00:18:16.940 --> 00:18:19.070
you won't go crazy right now, will you?

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:20.460
No.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:23.960
Before I did this,

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:27.280
I was already mentally
prepared for everything.

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.520
You really don't have any conditions?

00:18:39.970 --> 00:18:40.530
I do.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:46.710
Rest your head on my lap.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.670
What?

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:50.390
Rest your head on my lap.

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.860
I like the way you lie on my lap

00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:54.060
watching TV.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:37.920
Too bad…

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.670
There isn't a single star

00:19:40.670 --> 00:19:41.950
in the sky tonight.

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.210
It's really my first time
coming to the riverside late at night.

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.160
Will you still give me

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.110
12,000 yuan a month from now on?

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:33.410
from now on?

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:36.030
What?

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.040
I mean the 12,000 yuan a month.

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:41.420
Cheng Ken,

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:43.830
are you out of your mind?

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:46.830
That money was for the position,

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:49.320
not for you.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.830
You embezzled over 2,000,000 yuan

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:54.780
and I did nothing.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.130
Now I'm taking all the blame.

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:56.980
I lost my job

00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.700
because of you.

00:20:57.700 --> 00:20:58.630
You caused this.

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.610
Give me an explanation now!

00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:10.290
I'm sorry, I...

00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:12.280
Give me an explanation.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:15.440
Cheng Ken,

00:21:16.590 --> 00:21:18.300
when I got into your car just now,

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.300
we were outside the factory, right?

00:21:22.090 --> 00:21:23.350
But that day you told me

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:26.670
when you got into my car,
it was inside the factory—

00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:28.020
where there are cameras.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:29.500
So if you drown,

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.700
I'd have to go down with you, wouldn't I?

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.980
There aren't any cameras
outside the factory, right?

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.350
What's wrong?

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.130
What's wrong?

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.260
You know what I mean.

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:40.820
What's wrong?

00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.570
Keep messing with me
and I'll wipe out your whole family.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:47.230
You've got a daughter, right?

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.440
Can she swim?

00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.260
This place is a dump—
it's the middle of the night

00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.660
and I can't even get a cab.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.010
I'm driving your car away.

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:04.010
Come get it from me

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:05.990
at the factory gate tomorrow.

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.060
Dad,

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:35.910
what's wrong with you?

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:36.910
I'm fine.

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:37.630
I'm really fine.

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:38.780
You won't believe
what I'm about to tell you.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:39.670
Just now on my way back,

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.800
I saw a big white fish

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.230
in the river.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:44.200
-How big?
-Very big.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:45.360
This big.

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.190
This big?

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:47.400
This big!

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.080
This big.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.060
It's white.

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:49.980
White?

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.550
It was white like this.

00:23:51.550 --> 00:23:52.800
Even whiter than this.

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:53.740
It was glowing.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.630
Glowing?

00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:55.870
Its scales were glowing.

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:56.910
Is it this big?

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:57.990
It was bigger than this.

00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:59.340
And it had a big tail.

00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:00.870
Its tail was even bigger than this.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.300
Just imagine how big the fish was.

00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:03.540
It was swinging its big tail

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.300
right there in the river.

00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.170
It was just circling and circling.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:06.840
Really?

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:07.970
I wanted to catch it.

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:09.300
So I jumped into the water

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.630
and started chasing it.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.920
But I couldn't catch up no matter what.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:13.850
It was too fast.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:15.060
That big tail

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.630
kept slapping the water—

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.220
splash, splash—and jumping up like this.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:19.080
Then I realized

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.110
there were little fish beside it too.

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:22.600
-Little fish?
-How many?

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.760
About four or five.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.630
They were also

00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:26.390
white.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:27.630
And there were red ones too.

00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:28.550
They were glowing too.

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.530
Was it that big?

00:24:29.550 --> 00:24:30.630
It was bigger than this.

00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:31.260
Bigger than this?

00:24:31.260 --> 00:24:32.100
They were along...

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.700
Then the big fish swam ahead,

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.010
and the little fish

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:36.850
were jumping on its back.

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:38.050
I want to see them too.

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:39.260
They swam away.

00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:40.350
I couldn't catch up.

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:41.590
How about another day?

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:43.420
Dad will take you to see it once a week.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.070
Really?

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.700
I can't guarantee when we'll see them,

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:47.390
but we'll definitely go look once a week.

00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:49.120
We'll wait there that night for them.

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:50.650
We'll definitely see them.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:54.650
Keep watching.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.010
I'm going to wash up.

00:26:07.390 --> 00:26:09.160
I wish everyone perseverance to the end

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.660
and assets worth over 100 million.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.750
Good!

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:17.350
Don't go inside.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.190
Come here.

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:19.980
Stand properly.

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:21.720
Don't think this is over.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:22.700
Do you know

00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.120
what you did wrong today?

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:26.600
Our parents were called in again.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.650
The hallucinogen you took

00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.480
is extremely potent.

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:46.040
It can alter your personality
on a psychological level.

00:26:46.410 --> 00:26:47.750
What's even more frightening

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:49.750
is that your brain is being deceived

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:51.910
and you won't even notice the change,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.910
because it reshapes
your perception itself.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.240
Some people, after taking it,

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.300
[Sis, I won't turn into someone else—
and neither will you.]

00:26:57.300 --> 00:26:58.620
go from being calm

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.100
to becoming irritable and short-tempered.

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.780
And others,

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.520
after taking it...

00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.700
Director Dai.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:08.160
Come in.

00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.020
I'd like to ask for some time off.

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:12.690
Did the school call the parents in again?

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:13.140
No.

00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.830
Well,

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.490
Wang Ping and Wang An
are being released from rehab.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.620
I was thinking of going to pick them up.

00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:20.380
Their time's up—they're being released.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.380
Alright, go ahead.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:21.700
Okay.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:23.160
I'm giving you the day off.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.390
You don't need to come in
tomorrow morning either—

00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:25.590
get some rest at home.

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.480
I've heard everything.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.980
Since Ding Lai died,

00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:31.630
you've been doing field visits
during the day,

00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:32.890
reviewing surveillance at night,

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:34.370
and taking care of your kids
whenever you have a moment.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:36.110
I'm worried you'll drop dead
from exhaustion.

00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:37.300
Why would I drop dead?

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:37.560
I...

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.780
I can hold on.

00:27:38.910 --> 00:27:40.840
About Ding Lai getting hit by a car,

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:41.910
do you really believe

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.240
it was just an ordinary traffic accident?

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:48.800
Wenjing,

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.070
the last drug dealer is dead.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.870
The drug case
has turned into a traffic case.

00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:57.270
Wouldn't it be better if everyone relaxed?

00:27:58.450 --> 00:28:00.470
Why do you always talk about backing down?

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:03.260
Do you think I don't know
what's going on in your head?

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:04.670
You must be worrying about

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.020
the fact that we still have
450 grams of hallucinogen

00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:07.620
that haven't been found yet.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:10.570
I am worrying about it.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.780
But I also want to close the case.

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:17.920
Look, we've been cops for years.

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.300
Not every case

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:22.610
can be perfectly
clean-cut and crystal clear,

00:28:22.610 --> 00:28:23.330
right?

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.960
But sooner or later,
the truth will come out.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.270
Alright.

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.490
If you want to investigate,
I won't stop you.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:35.820
I just have one request:

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:39.490
don't push yourself too hard.

00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:43.260
I'm just worried that one day
I'll have to show up at your house

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:45.520
and hand medals to your dad and your kids.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.350
What are you talking about?

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:47.540
Who's making you hand out medals?

00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:48.420
You're hilarious.

00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:49.490
You have no faith in me.

00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:51.210
Then take my words to heart.

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.830
I'll take that to heart…

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:52.980
Alright,

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.150
it's noted.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.210
She's so stubborn.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:11.390
Officer Zhang.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:14.780
Are you looking for Wenjing again?

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.780
Why can't I be here for you this time?

00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:18.670
Don't tease me.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.460
You said we'd have dinner
together last time,

00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:21.980
but it still hasn't happened.

00:29:21.980 --> 00:29:23.910
I've just been really busy lately.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:24.540
Of course,

00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.110
no matter how busy I am,
I'm never busier than you guys.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:27.860
She's so busy that I haven't even
been able to see her.

00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.060
At this rate,

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.860
she's going to get promoted, right?

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.300
I don't know if she will,

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:33.350
but if Wenjing becomes director,

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:34.540
I'm all for it.

00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:36.610
You're really good to our Wenjing.

00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:37.440
Exactly.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.020
Are you guys still

00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:40.110
working on that

00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:41.250
drug...

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:42.580
drug trafficking case?

00:29:43.410 --> 00:29:44.320
Didn't you watch the news?

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.430
That's in the past.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.500
There you go again,

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.870
playing "cops and civilians—
one big family."

00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:48.400
Wenjing,

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.510
he said you're going to become director.

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.590
Maybe in my next life.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:52.870
Don't touch the stuff on my desk.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:54.270
I'll go through it tomorrow.

00:29:54.270 --> 00:29:56.110
Finally, you're not bringing work
into your personal life.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.110
That's progress.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:57.870
You're teasing me.

00:29:57.870 --> 00:29:58.630
You're teasing a big shot, huh?

00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:59.260
Officer Zhang,

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.340
you're looking sharp today.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.350
I'll wait for you to ask me out to dinner.

00:30:01.350 --> 00:30:01.880
Wenjing,

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:03.180
take my car.

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:05.510
Is this your car?

00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:08.090
Isn't this the one you've always liked?

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.680
You got it!

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:10.600
I picked up a new model recently.

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:12.180
If you make money, you've gotta spend it.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:12.750
Get in.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:14.520
You're looking sharp.

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.280
Xiaoya.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.210
The new car smell.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.370
Take it in.

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.350
[Xiekang Drug Rehabilitation Center]

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:23.060
The yellow-level monitoring
will last at least three years.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.120
During these three years,

00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.320
you must report to
the designated department regularly.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.240
The monitoring system is nationwide—

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:32.330
using your ID

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.850
for trains, flights, hotels,
or internet access

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:35.240
will trigger an alert.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.110
You also have to undergo inspections
by public security authorities.

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:39.180
After three years,

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.100
if it's verified
that you haven't relapsed,

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:43.750
you can request a certificate
from the local police station.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:46.650
Then the city Public Security Bureau
can lift the dynamic monitoring,

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.360
lowering your status from yellow

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.080
to blue,

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.530
and eventually remove the ID alert.

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.960
Can I still
take the graduate entrance exam?

00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:59.200
Theoretically, it won't affect it.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:00.550
Theoretically?

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:03.070
People with a history of drug use
cannot join the military

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:05.080
or work in state-owned enterprises,

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.940
but for enrollment, employment,

00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:08.810
and social security benefits,

00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:10.760
there is no official discrimination.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.030
So, will the people in charge of
the grad school political review

00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:14.830
know I've been to rehab?

00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.250
Yes.

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:22.350
Take this up to the second floor, sign,

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.550
and collect your personal belongings.

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:42.830
What did Mr. Qi say about

00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:44.150
the grad exam?

00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:45.310
It's okay.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.900
It won't be affected.

00:31:47.930 --> 00:31:49.140
Isn't that great?

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.660
Thank you.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.970
They're both waiting outside.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:01.280
This is a fresh start.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:02.020
From now on,

00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:03.850
stop dragging your sister down.

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:08.600
After the dealer nicknamed Quan

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:09.710
died,

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:11.450
we interrogated his subordinate.

00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:13.120
The subordinate admitted
that he had pressured

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.650
Tang Sile into using drugs.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.240
Tang Sile never even
intended to commit suicide.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.760
During the chase,

00:32:19.790 --> 00:32:21.090
he realized he couldn't leave

00:32:21.090 --> 00:32:22.460
any evidence against me,
so he tried to destroy it all.

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:23.180
He ran out of options

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:24.330
and swallowed all the drugs.

00:32:24.330 --> 00:32:25.200
Otherwise,

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:27.440
at such a young age,

00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:28.670
with a bright future ahead...

00:32:28.670 --> 00:32:30.430
Look at what this drug

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.680
has done to people.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.450
Wang An, you need to
have some sense of the consequences.

00:32:34.450 --> 00:32:35.840
If your sister hadn't found out in time,

00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.640
just imagine the consequences.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:41.570
I understand.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.350
I know I was wrong,

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:45.510
and I hurt my sister.

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:47.870
I apologize to you all.

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:48.670
That's enough.

00:32:48.670 --> 00:32:50.010
Why say that?

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:52.910
You were fooled

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:54.190
by Tang Sile too,

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.920
weren't you?

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:00.920
Wenjing, go on.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:02.780
I heard that several dealers

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.300
in the county died.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:05.440
You just mentioned Quan—

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.050
did he have a boss behind him?

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.350
Is the boss still alive?

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.610
Why are you so excited?

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.680
Why are you so interested in our case?

00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.300
Isn't it thrilling?

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.840
Besides, I love suspense stories.

00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:17.870
In a couple of days,
we have a Wechat business meetup—

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.360
I'll just go over and brag a little.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.090
I've told you

00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:21.570
everything I can tell you.

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:22.510
As for what I can't say,

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:23.950
I'm not allowed to.

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:24.780
Do you think I'd still have my job

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:26.150
if I told you everything?

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:26.830
Fine.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:28.340
If you can talk about it later,

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.380
tell me then.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.480
Sure.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:31.950
Wenjing,

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.680
are there still drug dealers
in our county?

00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:37.290
I don't know.

00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.310
Xiaoya, stop here.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:45.590
Okay.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:47.570
Sorry for the trouble.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:48.710
Don't say that.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:49.510
You can go now.

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.550
Take care, you two.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.120
Okay.

00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:53.620
We'll keep in touch.

00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:07.760
Don't you think

00:34:08.290 --> 00:34:10.120
there's something off about them?

00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:10.960
I do.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:18.239

You're in this room.

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.600
I've been going up and down
several floors.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.070
The director heard I was injured on duty

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.060
and insisted I stay
in the special care unit.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:49.750
But the whole hospital
only has one unit like this

00:34:49.750 --> 00:34:50.739
and they arranged me here.

00:34:50.739 --> 00:34:51.280
It's great.

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.540
What great treatment.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:53.540
I refused,

00:34:53.580 --> 00:34:54.639
but they insisted.

00:34:54.659 --> 00:34:55.469
Come on.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:57.270
He meant well.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.400
It's nice here.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.090
It's quiet.

Let me check your wound.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:01.920
How's your recovery?

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.720
There's nothing to look at.

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:05.320
It's fine.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:08.460
When I got injured at the police academy,

Can't I just take a look?

00:35:11.130 --> 00:35:12.190
You're like my son.

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:13.270
My son pushes me out

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:14.350
at bath time

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:15.910
and won't let me in.

00:35:16.650 --> 00:35:17.210
Come on.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.770
Have something good to eat.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.900
Can you sit up?

00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:21.800
Yes.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.580
I brought some braised dishes.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:25.750
It's delicious.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.080
I had to line up for this;

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.140
it stays fresh for 48 hours—

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:29.780
two days.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.040
I'm your lifesaver, after all.

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.160
I even brought you food.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.830
Could you be a bit more enthusiastic?

00:35:53.830 --> 00:35:54.650
I paid for this.

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.170
It wasn't cheap.

00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.450
Back then...

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.790
I should've gone after Ding Lai.

00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:01.020
You've said that several times.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:01.830
If I had gone after Ding Lai,

00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:03.320
would you even be eating this now?

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:05.300
You'd be dead by now,

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:06.070
buddy.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:07.310
Now Ding Lai is dead,

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:07.860
and you're alive.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.660
What are you not satisfied with?

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.840
I'm not mad at you.

00:36:16.390 --> 00:36:18.390
I'm mad at myself for being useless.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.500
Ding Lai died senselessly.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:22.620
Lv Deli's goods still
haven't been recovered.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.520
My brother's case
still hasn't been solved.

00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.880
Aren't you dissatisfied too?

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:28.510
Cases have to be solved step by step.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:30.100
No rule says that

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.020
just because you want to solve a case,

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:33.080
you can solve it immediately, right?

00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:40.130
Is there any progress?

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:44.270
Sort of but not really.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:45.830
The truck that ran over Ding Lai

00:36:45.830 --> 00:36:47.460
was a single-cabin lorry

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:48.580
with a fake license plate—

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.030
there's no way to trace it.

00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:52.630
The motorcycle Ding Lai
was riding was stolen.

00:36:53.470 --> 00:36:55.230
The original owner was located,

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.120
but there was no issue—

00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.520
he just lost it.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:36:59.830
In addition, Ding Lai

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:00.830
was wearing a delivery uniform.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:01.870
Based on the material

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:03.270
and style, we were able to

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.760
locate the shop on Taobao.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.760
The shop owner provided a contact number

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.350
for the courier
who had delivered the items.

00:37:08.350 --> 00:37:09.350
The courier had left the package

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:10.770
within one kilometer

00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:12.270
of the stolen motorcycle,

00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:14.230
at the entrance of a building unit.

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:15.180
The note instructed him

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.770
to "leave it at the unit entrance and go,"

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.440
which he followed exactly.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.790
So far, this is
all the information we have.

00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.870
It provides some leads,
but not significant ones.

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:25.270
His hiding place is likely nearby.

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.620
That's what I thought, too.

00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.580
But the direction Ding Lai fled that day

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:30.460
is different from this address,

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.230
so there's no way to connect them.

00:37:34.690 --> 00:37:36.350
What about the payment account?
Was it investigated?

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:37.540
The Taobao account,

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:38.310
phone account,

00:37:38.310 --> 00:37:39.240
and bank account

00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:41.540
all belong to a villager from Zaodao Town.

00:37:41.540 --> 00:37:43.140
This was set up years ago

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.500
when Ding Lai was involved in fraud,

00:37:44.500 --> 00:37:45.750
and he has been using

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.010
the same ID ever since.

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:51.080
You have to admit, he's quite cunning.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.000
He's always one step ahead of us,

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:55.070
just a bit faster.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.320
What about the phone?

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:58.480
Did you find it?

00:37:59.100 --> 00:37:59.640
No.

00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:04.620
He has a secure phone.

00:38:04.650 --> 00:38:06.580
Didn't he carry it when he went out?

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:12.360
For Ding Lai to hide in Nuanfeng County
for a whole month,

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:13.190
he must either

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.140
have a prearranged safe house

00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:16.580
or accomplices.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.790
Otherwise, even basic things
like getting meals would be a problem.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:20.710
I'm convinced he must have accomplices,

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.840
so that's the direction I'm pursuing.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:24.730
Do you think

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.910
the person
who took the girl from the hotel

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:30.770
is one of Ding Lai's accomplices?

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.310
Longzheng,

00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:36.790
can you tell me another story

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.350
about catching bad guys?

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:38.750
Sure.

00:38:38.830 --> 00:38:39.610
Let me finish eating first.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.350
Let me finish eating first.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.210
Sit over there.

00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:42.500
Who's this?

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:43.780
Someone from the ward over there.

00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:44.770
Did you brag about something?

00:38:44.770 --> 00:38:45.920
What bragging?

00:38:46.290 --> 00:38:47.600
I'm Xue Jiang.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.290
Once I recover,

00:38:49.530 --> 00:38:51.530
I want to be a police officer

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:52.830
like Longzheng,

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:54.650
protecting the innocent.

00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:56.230
And you say you weren't bragging?

00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:57.390
I wasn't.

00:38:57.720 --> 00:38:59.020
-Auntie,
-Jin Longzheng...

00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.180
are you a police officer too?

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:00.660
I am.

00:39:00.660 --> 00:39:01.540
But I'm not as brave as he is.

00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:02.540
See, he got injured,

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:03.740
and I'm perfectly fine.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.910
That's a great dream you have.

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.020
Here, have some pork head meat.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.350
Try it, it's delicious.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.240
I just want to listen to
Longzheng's stories.

00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:12.320
So he's just here for the stories.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:12.870
Hurry up and eat.

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:14.870
Finish up so you can tell him a story.

00:39:31.390 --> 00:39:32.720
What are you doing here?

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.280
I still want

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:38.580
to speak my mind.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.240
If you have something to say,

00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.080
just say it.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:46.740
Jiang was born with a heart defect.

00:39:48.150 --> 00:39:51.060
Jiajia has been suffering from
uremia for several years.

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:52.620
We're both fathers,

00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:55.580
all fighting desperately

00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.200
to keep our children alive.

00:39:59.870 --> 00:40:01.350
I know you've surely

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.570
experienced many times when you saw hope

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.170
only for it to be dashed.

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:14.270
A few years ago,

00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:17.960
my parents and my wife

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:21.840
were killed in an accident.

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:29.950
Now, aside from my daughter,

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.100
I have nothing left.

00:40:32.770 --> 00:40:34.510
I don't know how to keep going.

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.240
What does that have to do with me?

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.020
My son is getting better.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.850
Can't you see?

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.280
Can you give me a little hope?

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:03.850
Give what?

00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.920
How?

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:05.670
With what?

00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:09.870
I just want to hear you say one thing:

00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:14.700
if

00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:17.350
Jiang

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.190
doesn't make it,

00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:21.810
could you consider Jiajia?

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:25.120
I'll have Jiajia take care of
you when you get old.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.550
Haven't I told you?

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:29.400
Stop thinking about my son.

00:41:29.590 --> 00:41:30.990
I'll say it one more time:

00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:32.350
if you keep thinking about my son,

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:33.440
I'll risk my life

00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:35.270
to kill you. Do you believe that?

00:41:38.290 --> 00:41:39.850
I just want a word from you.

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:43.580
Lie to me if you have to.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.370
Give me something to live for.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:06.970
I can't.

00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:08.990
Not even half a word.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:21.190
I know you need money.

00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:23.870
I can pay.

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.900
I can give you whatever amount you want.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:28.980
No matter how poor I am,

00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.620
I won't sell my son's organs.

00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.440
I'm not asking you to sell.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:33.760
I...

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:36.230
Just name a figure.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:39.140
I can leave the money here

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.070
with you for now.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:42.110
If he gets better,

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:43.770
you won't have to give it back.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.020
Consider it my contribution

00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.670
to his future education.

00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:50.120
But if...

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.220
Are you crazy?

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.230
Just bored with nothing to do?

00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:55.090
Got money and nowhere to spend it?

00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:58.560
Fine.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:00.830
If you've got money
and nowhere to spend it, give it to me.

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:01.830
One million yuan.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:02.580
Bring it here.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.380
Do you have it?

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.910
After all these years of
paying for your child's treatment,

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:07.950
don't you know how much you've got left?

00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:08.810
One million yuan?

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:09.990
Yes, one million yuan.

00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.840
Bring it here.

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:16.070
One million yuan.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:18.820
It's settled.

00:44:33.710 --> 00:44:34.540
Come on.

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.150
Don't think that doing me a favor

00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:37.530
gives you the right to act so boldly.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.260
You said it was unconditional.

00:44:40.540 --> 00:44:41.460
Did you find out

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.320
how Ding Lai died?

00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.870
What did the police say?

00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:48.840
Whenever the case comes up,

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:50.140
they were vague.

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:52.770
But that colleague of Hu Wenjing said

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:53.870
the drug dealers

00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:56.830
are already a thing of the past.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:44:59.650
That should mean
the case is closed, right?

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:01.540
Impossible.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:03.700
It's not that simple.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:05.960
Enough.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.640
I can't be bothered with all this.

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:09.970
Right now, the most important thing for me

00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.880
is to enjoy the moment.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.680
How much have you spent this month?

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:18.620
Just a few hundred thousand.

00:45:19.060 --> 00:45:21.260
Ding Lai gave you
a little over a million in total.

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.790
At this rate, you'll
spend it all in a few days.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.300
Can you think about the future?

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.720
I've already thought it through.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:31.730
I've set my eyes on an
excellent product line,

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:33.600
and I want to
secure its distribution rights.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:34.440
This product

00:45:34.460 --> 00:45:35.990
is going to sell like crazy.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:37.140
Then

00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:39.000
everyone in Haizhou City will see

00:45:39.130 --> 00:45:41.860
who the best microbusiness owner
here really is.

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:44.460
Fame brings trouble.

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:46.900
Business isn't that easy.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.490
Actually, lately,

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:13.930
I've been looking at you more favorably.

00:46:15.450 --> 00:46:16.530
You're

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:17.880
actually quite nice.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:19.850
But you're

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.710
just a little too cautious.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.760
Do you remember what I just told you?

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:30.540
You have to enjoy life while you can.
