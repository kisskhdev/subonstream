WEBVTT

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.080
Forgive me, My Lord

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:42.840
I did conceal the truth

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.520
Since I married my husband

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.640
I could only bear him two daughters

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.280
Out of desperation

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.120
we bought a woman

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:53.640
Thinking

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.280
that if she could give my husband

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.640
a little son

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.520
and continue the Tian family line, it would be good

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.120
The two of us agreed

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:02.680
to tell outsiders that

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.640
we found a maid to serve me at home

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.520
Then why did you fabricate the story of hemorrhage?

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.440
That was all Tian Wan's sin

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.880
Husband, don't be anxious yet

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.440
That doctor's diagnosis might not be accurate

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.200
If he says it's a girl, it's a girl

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.000
Sister, get up first

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.080
Don't hurt the baby

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.360
What use do I have for a daughter?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.680
You broodmare

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.160
I bought you to give me a son

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.360
If you can't bear a son

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.880
what do I need you for?

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.040
Just strangle her

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.240
If this pregnancy is no good

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.440
just have another one next time

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.440
You have the nerve to speak?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.720
If it weren't for your failure

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.600
why would I spend money to buy her?

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.120
This baby

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.760
this baby

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.400
I don't want this baby anymore

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.400
I don't want it

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.560
I don't want this baby anymore

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.680
I don't want it

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.560
Bear me another one

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.320
Bear me another! Bear me another!

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.600
That woman was force-fed medicine

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.320
and miscarried

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.600
But before that woman could recover

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.480
Tian Wan couldn't wait

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.040
During the day

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.120
Tian Wan locked her in the woodshed

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:37.240
At night

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.600
he would carry her into the room

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.800
Tian Wan was right

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.840
In his eyes, that woman was just a broodmare

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.880
No different

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.480
from pigs and dogs

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.240
As a woman myself,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.120
I couldn't bear to watch any longer.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.520
I was terrified Tian Wan would torture her to death.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.120
So I seized the chance to unlock the padlock.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.000
And let her go.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.880
But Tian Wan found out afterwards.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.640
He chased her to the outskirts of the city.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.760
Stop right there!

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.720
Didn't you say you could bear a boy?

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.240
Give me a boy then!

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.360
Give me one!

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.080
You broodmare!

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.480
Please let her go!

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.680
Torturing her like this...

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.880
If someone dies...

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.080
What will we do if the authorities investigate?

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.640
Get away!

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.680
She must be carrying my little son.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:26.920
Run! Run!

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.360
Go on, run!

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.800
I'll teach you to run!

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.760
Is it so hard to give me a child?

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.600
I spent so much silver!

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.080
And didn't hear a single sound!

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.080
She's dead.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.880
Dead.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.200
Dead.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.840
D-Dead.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.480
She's dead.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.040
Dead.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.440
She's dead.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.240
I didn't mean to do it!

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.240
What are you staring at? Hurry up and carry her!

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.440
Hurry up! Hurry!

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.160
My Lord.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.920
That is the whole truth.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.960
I was afraid that if I got involved in a lawsuit,

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.680
It would implicate my two daughters.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.960
That is why I hid the truth from you yesterday, My Lord.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.920
Mother.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.480
Everything my mother said is true.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.280
Father doesn't like us.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.920
And he doesn't like Mother.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.440
My father did this.

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.560
What was that woman's name?

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.040
Jin Yue.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.600
We have news from the silver shop.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:54.480
About four months ago,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.000
Hu Pin had a longevity bracelet made at a silver shop in the Ghost Market.

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.640
The shop owner recognized the portrait.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.760
It's confirmed.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.480
How much did it cost?

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.880
Ten guan.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.120
Ten guan.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.240
That's three months' salary for a county magistrate.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.280
Hu Pin is so poor.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.680
Where did this money come from?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.800
I think it came from here.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.440
What is this?

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.120
If I'm not mistaken...

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.800
A Wife-pawning Contract.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.440
Let me try.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.720
Broker.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.640
Hu Mei.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.120
I'll go find this Hu Mei.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.560
Hurry.

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.160
My Lord! My Lord!

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:15.120
My Lord!

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.560
This is Hu Mei's home.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.800
My Lord.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:20.360
You should have said earlier that you're from the Dali Temple.

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:20.680
In that case,

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.800
How could I have charged you so much money?

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.120
Thank you for the reward, My Lord.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.680
I'll take my leave now.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.480
Mm-hmm.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.200
Let's go.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.680
Who are you?

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:43.440
What are you doing in my house?

00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:47.640
Dali Temple questioning.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.120
I haven't done anything wrong.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.200
Why are you looking for me?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.560
Do you know Tian Wan?

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:53.720
I don't know him.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:54.840
You answered so quickly.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.560
Could his death be related to you?

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.320
M-My Lord.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.120
You are wrongly accusing a common woman.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.280
His death has nothing to do with me.

00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.160
You can't accuse people falsely.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:05.680
Whether it's false or not,

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.960
a search will reveal.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:07.960
Guiyi, search.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.200
Everyone, come and look!

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.520
The officials are framing a good person!

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.000
You are bullying people with your power!

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.520
Everyone, come and look!

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.280
I will go to the Imperial City to sue you!

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.160
Drop this rascally act.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.040
Look at this.

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.880
The Tian Wan on this paper is dead.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.480
If we can find you,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:28.040
the killer can find you too.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:30.080
You will be the next to die.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:30.680
I...

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:31.960
If you want us to handle it,

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.720
then step aside.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.000
If you don't want us to handle it,

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.160
we will leave right now.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.160
Why not confess the truth?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:45.880
My Lord.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.240
It was Tian Wan.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.200
He was anxious to have a son.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.800
So I brokered a woman to be pawned to him.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.160
That's all.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.680
Who was the person pawned?

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.200
She seems to be called...

00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:57.800
Jin Yue.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.640
Where is the pawned person from?

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.440
I have a poor relative.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.480
He needed money urgently.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.600
So he asked me to find a taker.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.880
Is it Hu Pin?

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:14.960
Yes.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:19.720
My Lord.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:23.680
Found this.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.160
Why are there two?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.320
Both for the woman Jin Yue.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.120
The wife-pawner is Liu Quan.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.000
That is Jin Yue's man.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.880
That family is poor as dirt.

00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:42.120
And he is addicted to gambling.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.640
Since Jin Yue married him,

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:44.800
she hasn't given birth to a single child.

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.440
He heard a childless one could be pawned for a good price.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:49.760
In order to gamble,

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.640
he pawned his own wife.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:52.960
My Lord.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.600
I've said everything I know.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.080
That killing has absolutely nothing to do with me.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.160
She was pawned by Liu Quan to Hu Pin.

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.200
And then pawned by Hu Pin to Tian Wan.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.640
The same woman,

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.120
was actually pawned twice by you people.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.240
Treating her like an object to be traded at will.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:09.280
You wicked people,

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:10.480
will surely suffer heaven's wrath.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.840
My Lord, I... I...

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.760
As a woman yourself,

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.080
how could you be so cruel?

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.080
If your children were pawned to others,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.200
how would you feel?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:24.840
My Lord.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.760
I'm not the only one brokering wife-pawning.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.560
So many people do it.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.480
My Lord, spare my life.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:37.600
Guiyi.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:41.960
Guiyi.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:43.880
I can understand your feelings.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.840
Now that Jin Yue is dead,

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640
she has left the filth of this world.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.880
She has found peace.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.560
Mm.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:50.560
Let's go.

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.520
Let's check Liu Quan's house.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:53.240
Mm.
