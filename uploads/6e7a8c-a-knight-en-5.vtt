WEBVTT

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.595
Do not panic.

00:00:12.304 --> 00:00:13.555
Remain in formation.

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.141
Keep your mounts as long as you can.

00:00:16.683 --> 00:00:18.101
These men mean to see you dead.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:20.520
They will fight savagely.

00:00:20.604 --> 00:00:22.272
As will we, my lord.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:32.366
Green fucking boys!

00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.535
What of the Kingsguard?

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:38.205
Take heart, Beesbury.
I will handle the Kingsguard.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:41.666
Their oath forbids them
to harm a prince of the blood.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.127
Is that honorable, Your Grace?

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.254
The gods will let us know.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.006
Mother loved you best, huh?

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.343
Shame.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.763
No man fights so fierce
as one neglected by his mother.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:01.478
Be vigilant.

00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:03.438
Don't die.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:11.863
Ser.

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:13.156
My lance, squire.

00:01:29.298 --> 00:01:31.091
You best be here when I get back.

00:01:34.595 --> 00:01:37.555
Rob me, and I'll hunt you down

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:38.599
with dogs.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:42.060
Woof!

00:02:02.164 --> 00:02:05.792
May the Seven bear witness
to our solemn and bloody offering.

00:02:07.878 --> 00:02:11.131
May they peer inside our mortal hearts
and find the truth.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.260
May the Warrior grant victory
to the innocent...

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.764
And reveal the guilty in their falseness.

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:24.686
May death sustain life.

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:10.649
Up! Up! Go!

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.570
Up! Up! Go!

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.739
Hyah!

00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:22.220
Fuck!

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.277
Ma... ma...

00:04:41.656 --> 00:04:42.991
Ma...

00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:47.245
I'm sorry.

00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:01.718
- Don't!
- Ah!

00:05:01.802 --> 00:05:03.345
What the fuck are you doing?

00:05:04.179 --> 00:05:05.513
He's got a seal.

00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:06.723
He's dying.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:09.892
If we can get him off the hill,
might someone pay us

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:12.020
for his ransom. Quick!

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:45.303
Fuck!

00:05:51.643 --> 00:05:52.978
Do you know any words?

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:55.981
What's that mean?

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:00.694
You see, when these bloody highborn spoil,
you gotta say words for them.

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.821
Oh.

00:06:03.905 --> 00:06:05.948
- Why?
- So they don't end up

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.701
in no hell with the rest of us.

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:13.498
I don't know any words.

00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:19.963
Right. Check his mouth.

00:06:20.964 --> 00:06:23.007
I know a witch who pays copper for teeth.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.801
I am your queen!

00:06:24.885 --> 00:06:26.553
Wipe my arse, liege.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:29.764
What?

00:06:29.848 --> 00:06:31.349
You never seen a man die before?

00:06:32.517 --> 00:06:33.893
Yeah.

00:06:33.977 --> 00:06:35.979
But not like that.

00:06:37.564 --> 00:06:39.065
He was crying for his mother.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:40.442
Yeah, what's she gonna do?

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:43.528
Lift the fucking horse off his legs?

00:06:43.612 --> 00:06:44.905
Shit, come on.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:06.300
Right, come on.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.594
Come on.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:13.599
I just don't know why we're in
such a rush to leave anymore.

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:17.354
The war is over.
The Black Dragon is dead.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.648
Ferret said we're all to get free bread now.

00:07:20.732 --> 00:07:21.733
Are you stupid?

00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.444
Nothing's over.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.699
Don't you remember when Pudding killed
Cedric's little brother?

00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.492
- That was an accident.
- Aye.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.411
And we all figured that'd be the end to it,

00:07:33.495 --> 00:07:35.329
only for Cedric to come back a year later

00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:37.958
and near burn down half of Flea Bottom
trying to kill Pudding.

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:42.879
No one forgets shit.

00:07:42.963 --> 00:07:45.465
You hurt someone, they hurt you back.

00:07:47.008 --> 00:07:48.801
If you want to stay, fine.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:51.179
But Flea Bottom is full up on people hurting.

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:53.264
It's tinder waiting to catch.

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.154
Stay calm now.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:10.699
You'll be alright.

00:08:25.213 --> 00:08:26.256
Rafe.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:31.136
Dunk.

00:08:38.643 --> 00:08:39.894
What's in the bag?

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:43.606
Rats.

00:08:45.275 --> 00:08:46.276
Oh!

00:08:47.736 --> 00:08:48.778
Rats!

00:08:50.739 --> 00:08:51.823
Let's see 'em, then.

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.590
Fucking cunt!

00:09:11.259 --> 00:09:12.718
You shouldn't have done that.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.053
You know what Alester's like.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:17.723
Aye, and the evil bastard was about to
steal our shit, so I stole his.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.016
That's not what I meant.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.601
Oh, is that not what you meant?

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.186
I'm doing him a favor.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.606
This ale tastes as sour
as the queen's own brew.

00:09:25.607 --> 00:09:26.608
Come on.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.616
We'll all be plundering
that tomb for a dragon's age.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:38.912
Hey!

00:09:39.704 --> 00:09:41.580
Daemon's rebellion is over.

00:09:41.664 --> 00:09:43.583
Take your Blackfyre leather elsewhere.

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.428
Is it enough?

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:57.847
It's enough.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:10.777
Hey, don't lose your nerve now.

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:13.279
The shit part's done.

00:10:14.405 --> 00:10:15.990
I know.

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.117
We'll be sailing off
into all kinds of adventures.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.703
- Don't you want that?
- I do.

00:10:20.787 --> 00:10:21.913
I just...

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.166
What?

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.921
What if the Free Cities
are no better than here?

00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.799
What if they're worse?

00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:36.510
Then we'll go someplace else.

00:10:36.594 --> 00:10:38.429
What if it's all shit?

00:10:38.513 --> 00:10:42.267
Every place?
What if this is the best there is?

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.687
That would be quite sad.

00:10:50.525 --> 00:10:54.612
And what if my mother comes back for me?

00:10:57.991 --> 00:11:00.660
I'm not stupid. I know she's dead.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.290
But what if she's just trying to get away
from wherever she is?

00:11:05.874 --> 00:11:06.874
Like we are?

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:09.669
If I leave, then how will she find me?

00:11:10.795 --> 00:11:13.047
You are fucking stupid sometimes.

00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.217
If your mother was alive,

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:17.676
she's not coming back for you.

00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.095
You don't know that.

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.306
I know I never got nothin' by waiting around.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.933
You want a family?

00:11:25.476 --> 00:11:28.104
Go out there, get a family.

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:31.608
I just want to be with you.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.360
'Cause you love me.

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.571
Yeah.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:41.451
Well...

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:44.704
I love you too, don't I?

00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.125
And I'm going.

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.754
So, you best be coming with me.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.890
This city is too small for us, Dunk.

00:12:06.309 --> 00:12:07.894
Let's show her our arse.

00:12:32.961 --> 00:12:34.087
Right, come on, Dunk.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:46.975
Dunk, get a move on.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:05.576
Two fares to the Free Cities.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.415
What? Our silver don't spend?

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:13.042
Price is double.

00:13:13.126 --> 00:13:15.712
You're not the only ones
who mean to get the fuck out of here.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:19.256
- Right. Move!
- Wait, get off me!

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.425
Rafe.

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.802
Fuck!

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:25.930
- I suppose you're happy.
- What?

00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.641
You've got plenty of time to wait around
for your dead mother now.

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:34.981
I'm sorry.

00:13:36.357 --> 00:13:38.026
We'll find a way.

00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:46.701
You got quick hands, girl.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.623
I used to have quick hands.

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.850
I'll have me ale-skin back.

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.688
I sold it.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:21.360
No! No, no.

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:22.779
We can get it back.

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.912
Oh, what's that?

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:34.957
Fuck off! Give it back.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.001
Give it back.

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:45.342
Holding out on us.

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:46.552
That's ours.

00:14:47.637 --> 00:14:50.097
Little gutter rats don't have silver.

00:14:50.181 --> 00:14:51.265
Only little thieves.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.851
We didn't thieve nothing.
We earned that.

00:14:53.935 --> 00:14:56.353
Stealing from dead nobles is still stealing.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:58.231
And what's stealing from us?

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:01.442
- That's life.
- Yeah.

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:08.907
Huh.

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:10.492
Come on.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:12.286
Rafe, let's go.

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:15.081
Rafe!

00:15:18.126 --> 00:15:19.127
Go on.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:23.756
Rafe.

00:15:41.023 --> 00:15:42.775
You little cunt.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.115
No!

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:11.804
Ah! Fuck!

00:16:16.601 --> 00:16:17.852
Stick him.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:22.398
In the name of the Mother!

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.359
Leave that boy be!

00:17:39.225 --> 00:17:40.726
Get out of my way!

00:17:50.361 --> 00:17:51.612
I'm sorry.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:41.745
Maybe I'll have some of those apples.

00:18:41.829 --> 00:18:43.205
Yes...

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:46.334
- Oh, you old fool.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:19:08.481 --> 00:19:12.109
Hey, boys. Did you miss me? Yeah.

00:22:24.635 --> 00:22:26.804
Ah, you old fool!

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:09.597
Get up.

00:24:57.663 --> 00:24:59.039
Come on!

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.288
Aerion!

00:26:31.507 --> 00:26:33.884
My boy! My boy!

00:26:51.527 --> 00:26:52.736
Get up.

00:26:53.987 --> 00:26:54.988
Get up, ser!

00:26:57.616 --> 00:26:59.201
Get up, Dunk!

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:01.453
Yield.

00:27:02.454 --> 00:27:03.956
Yield!

00:27:08.335 --> 00:27:09.837
Yield!

00:27:46.456 --> 00:27:49.418
Get up. Get up, ser.

00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.893
He's dead!

00:28:08.187 --> 00:28:09.479
It's over!

00:28:14.443 --> 00:28:15.861
Get up, ser!

00:28:17.321 --> 00:28:18.405
Get up!

00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:21.408
Get up!

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:23.785
Get up, Ser Duncan!

00:28:25.245 --> 00:28:27.831
Get up, ser. Get up!

00:28:31.835 --> 00:28:33.712
Get up.

00:28:35.756 --> 00:28:38.550
Wait!

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:11.375
Up! Up! Up! Up!

00:30:26.033 --> 00:30:28.452
I yield. I yield.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:13.246
Tell him!

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.832
Tell him! Tell him!

00:31:17.626 --> 00:31:18.877
Tell him!

00:31:22.589 --> 00:31:23.632
I...

00:31:25.258 --> 00:31:27.427
I withdraw my accusation.

00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.325
That's it.

00:31:51.284 --> 00:31:52.411
Come on.

00:31:53.954 --> 00:31:54.955
Steady now.

00:31:55.664 --> 00:31:56.873
I'll have to cut that mail off you.

00:31:58.625 --> 00:31:59.459
The others.

00:31:59.543 --> 00:32:01.836
Has anyone died?

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.172
Beesbury and Hardyng, in the first charge.

00:32:05.298 --> 00:32:06.299
Gods be good.

00:32:06.383 --> 00:32:09.761
The lance point drove the rings
deep into his flesh.

00:32:09.845 --> 00:32:11.680
One moment, I felt drunk.

00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:14.433
The next, like I'm dying.

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:19.354
We'll get drunk,
then we'll pour boiling oil on it.

00:32:19.438 --> 00:32:20.813
That's how the maesters do it.

00:32:20.897 --> 00:32:22.023
Wine. Not oil.

00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:24.817
Oil will kill him.

00:32:24.901 --> 00:32:27.695
I'll send Maester Yormwell
to have a look at him

00:32:27.779 --> 00:32:29.489
when he's done tending to my brother.

00:32:32.242 --> 00:32:33.910
Your Grace.

00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:36.705
I am your man.

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:40.542
Please. Your man.

00:32:42.836 --> 00:32:44.713
I need good men, Ser Duncan.

00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:48.175
The realm.

00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:58.935
Ser Raymun, my helm, if you would be so kind.

00:32:59.019 --> 00:33:00.353
- At once, Your Grace.
- Alright.

00:33:00.437 --> 00:33:01.813
You're alright. You're alright.

00:33:01.897 --> 00:33:05.275
Visor's... visor's cracked.

00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:08.195
My fingers feel...

00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:12.032
Fingers feel like wood.

00:33:14.951 --> 00:33:16.285
Goodman Pate.

00:33:16.369 --> 00:33:17.454
A hand.

00:33:20.832 --> 00:33:22.834
The helm, it's crushed
down the back, Your Grace.

00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:24.168
It's smashed into the gorget.

00:33:24.252 --> 00:33:25.879
My brother's mace, most like.

00:33:27.214 --> 00:33:28.965
He's strong.

00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:37.849
Gods be good.

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:53.031
No.

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.368
No, no! No.

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:59.579
No, no, Your Grace. Your Grace.

00:34:00.205 --> 00:34:02.123
Your Grace, get up, ser.

00:34:02.207 --> 00:34:04.543
Get up, ser! No!

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:06.336
No!

00:34:07.379 --> 00:34:08.380
Please!

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.178
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:34:20.433 --> 00:34:21.518
Get up!

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:24.229
I'm sorry.
