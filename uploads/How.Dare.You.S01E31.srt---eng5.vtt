[How dare you!?]

[Episode 31]

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:48.539
Your Highness.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.860
Your Highness.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.710
How is His Majesty doing?

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.840
After a rough night,

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.210
he's in no serious danger for now.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.440
Physician Xiao said

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.480
he was overwhelmed with grief,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.840
causing a surge in his blood

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.970
and triggering the poison in his body.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.950
He should keep his emotions
under control from now on

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.350
and avoid getting overly excited or upset.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.669
I see.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.140
Your Highness.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.310
His Majesty's headaches are
acting up more frequently.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.079
Although he's like an ordinary man
when he is

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.280
not having an attack,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.280
with such a toll on his body,

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.890
I fear...

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.170
Your Highness.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.579
I had a very long dream.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.540
I dreamed of Mr. Bei.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.790
What did he say in your dream?

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.650
He didn't say anything.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.240
He just kept smiling.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.690
Perhaps he met Nan,

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.930
the only person in this world
who understood him.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.710
Bai showed me a letter just now,

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.960
saying the Nameless
gave it to him long ago.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.360
What does the letter say?

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.160
It says that when the Nameless
divined the future,

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.750
he told Mr. Bei...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.200
if he came down the mountain to help you,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.760
he would perish.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.490
But he came anyway.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.579
So, in a way,

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.560
this was his own choice.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.700
I will bury him
beside Empress Ci Zhen's mausoleum.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.700
It is the only thing I can do for him.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.899
That is not all.

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.710
Mr. Bei sacrificed his life to save you.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.000
The best way

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.450
to repay him is to live well.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.750
But I don't know how long I can live.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.920
One more day,

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.000
one more hour, one more minute,
or even one more second will be good.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.530
As long as you don't give up,

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:43.990
I won't give up, either.

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.320
Why didn't he come?

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:27.940
I didn't expect

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.730
that you'd be the one who came.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.950
I fought you all as a mortal man.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.490
Although I lost,

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.650
I have nothing to be ashamed of.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.680
But you leveraged foresight

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.800
and used despicable means such as faking
a surrender to the Three Armies.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.510
It won't sound good if word gets out.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:03.350
Why aren't you speaking?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.630
Trying to provoke me?

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:09.070
No.

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.430
I pity you.

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.780
I pity that you've come to this point,

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:19.070
yet you still ascribe your fiasco

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.220
to some foresight

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.250
or some destined fate.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.130
I might as well tell you.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.430
The Central Army did not betray you.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.630
When they went through all the trouble

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.360
to capture His Majesty for you,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:34.640
they didn't know
he was a fake one, either.

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:38.920
I won't believe a single word you say.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.720
You have never believed anyone.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.050
Her Majesty got your birth mother killed,

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.840
but you dared not believe it.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.080
His Majesty wanted
to be a close brother to you,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.850
but you refused to believe it.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.470
Xie Yong'er gave you her true heart,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.160
wanting to stand by your side
in romantic harmony,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.760
but you...

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You disdained and didn't believe it.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.260
So stop talking about foresight or what.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.640
You already ruined

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.360
your only chance of winning

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.430
a long time ago.

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.290
Shut up!

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.040
Were it not for you, you witch,

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.510
would I have lost to Xiahou Dan?

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:36.720
Why?

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.110
Why did every single one of you

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:43.390
choose him?

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.780
One must love others

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.490
before being loved in return.

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.330
Stop there!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.530
Winner takes all.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.010
History is written by victors, after all.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.390
Xiahou Dan...

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.000
The Emperor's throne

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:23.930
has always been built on piles of bones.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:28.230
You will not escape this fate either.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.080
-Greetings,
-Greetings,

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.809
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.049
No need for this formality.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:36.780
You may rise.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.669
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.080
I'm so glad to see you safe,

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.000
Your Majesty.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.530
We thought we'd

00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:45.750
never get to see you again, Your Majesty.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.240
We've finally weathered the storm

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.720
and made it through.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:49.870
I heard

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.840
that in court, you

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.680
not only exposed Prince Duan's treason

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.880
but also kept yourselves safe.

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.840
Your cooperation was immaculate.

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:00.570
All thanks to Yang

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.270
and Er... Lord Er.

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.030
Thanks to their help.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.550
Otherwise,

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:07.410
I would have died in the main hall.

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.280
Your Majesty,

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:11.960
now that the rebels have been purged,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.030
we're here today

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.000
to learn

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:15.360
what the next steps are.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.440
Regaining the Three Armies

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.830
and returning safely

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.580
constituted only the first step.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.960
In court,

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.120
there will be a major reshuffle.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.410
When that happens,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.000
your burdens

00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:29.600
will be heavier.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.730
Your Majesty, do you intend

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:33.330
to conduct a purge?

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:34.650
Exactly.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.790
But Prince Duan's remnants
have taken root here deeply.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:42.590
Acting rashly

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:44.390
might cause great panic.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:47.610
Who said I am only moving
against Prince Duan's clique?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.320
I will also eliminate

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.940
the Empress Dowager's remnants.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.830
Your Majesty.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.730
No need for ceremony, Grand Secretary.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.170
Your Majesty, please.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.840
We haven't met in 5 years.

00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:44.320
Your Majesty,
you've made quite some progress at chess.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:46.550
I am not talented,

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.180
not even one-tenth as good as Xu Yao.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.230
Lately,

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:57.930
the court has been in turmoil,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.200
with enemies surrounding like wolves.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:01.600
I

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:03.280
didn't come sooner,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.380
fearing I would reveal the whereabouts.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:07.870
Also,

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.130
I didn't know how to face you,
my respected teacher.

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:15.890
Years ago, Your Majesty, you asked me

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.560
why my son wrote such excellent articles,

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.460
yet I didn't let him
pass the imperial examination.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.240
It was because,

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.610
although

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.340
my son was exceptionally gifted,

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.200
he was so naive

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.690
that he could easily be manipulated.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.480
I thought

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:41.250
he needed more experience.

00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:45.450
I didn't expect...

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.150
I didn't expect

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.790
that he would still be

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:57.150
used by Prince Duan and led astray.

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:04.790
I am ashamed.

00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:07.230
You are wrong, Mr. Xu.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:10.490
If Xu Yao hadn't risked his life to help

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.130
reveal Prince Duan's entire plan,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.480
I

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:18.960
might not have made it here alive
to see you today.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.870

to secure the nation's peace.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.240
My son died a worthy death.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.440
I

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:01.870
have no regrets.

[The Formation of Roaring Eight Immortals]

[Jiuzhou, 10 Days, 11 Winter]

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.840
I came here today

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:15.570
also to ask for one more favor.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.280
Please go ahead, Your Majesty.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.170
Today, although

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.950
the obvious enemies have been removed,

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:28.540
the court is still

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.920
full of remaining remnants.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:33.650
I want to get rid of them altogether.

00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:34.570
Therefore,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.630
I'd like to invite you,
my teacher, to return

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.560
and take charge.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.870
But the court has just settled down,
with the people still feeling uneasy.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.450
Overcorrecting now

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.870
might make your reputation as a tyrant

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:51.440
hard to get rid of.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.720
I also want to take it slowly.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.230
It's just that after hiding for so long,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.320
I am gravely poisoned

00:14:15.630 --> 00:14:17.290
and don't have much time left.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:24.760
Your Majesty.

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.550
Before I die,

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:30.110
I want to clear

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.450
all obstacles for the Empress

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.740
and hand over a clean court

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.030
and a stable Great Xia

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.320
to her.

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:51.350
This is the last thing

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.540
I can do for my wife as her husband.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:59.150
Please help fulfill my wish, Mr. Xu.

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:09.000
I

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.730
will certainly not fail this mission.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.170
I firmly believe

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.150
that you, Your Majesty, are
the true Son of Heaven.

00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:21.840
There's no way you could be replaced
by Prince Duan.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.870
During the days
you were away, Your Majesty,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:24.360
I

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.700
gritted my teeth
for the court and the state,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.370
pretending to cooperate

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.440
with Prince Duan's faction.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:35.770
It really took me quite a lot of effort.

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:46.110
Mr. Chen, your words are

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.030
truly moving.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.380
How should I

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.750
reward you?

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.480
I

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.130
do not want a reward.

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:01.360
I only seek to serve our Great Xia

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.240
devotedly

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.230
until my last breath.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.110
Very well.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:10.360
Then I

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:12.600
will grant your wish.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:14.790
Guards!

00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:15.820
Yes!

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.860
Arrest him!

00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:19.710
Your Majesty!

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:21.640
What's this for, Your Majesty?

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:22.470
Your Majesty!

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:23.910
Why, Your Majesty?

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.520
Chen Danian and his brother Chen Dasui

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.240
sold official positions,

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.270
accepted bribes,

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.550
formed cliques for personal gain,

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:32.750
and disrupted the court's discipline.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.420
For more than a decade,

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:37.440
they've embezzled
over 100,000 taels of silver,

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.380
seized 300,000 mu of fields,

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.660
placed spies in various ministries,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.840
and even

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.940
secretly colluded with spies
from the Qiang State.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.810
These crimes and evidence are

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:53.110
too many to be listed!

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.030
Do you

00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.960
admit your guilt?

00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:58.350
Your Majesty!

00:16:58.550 --> 00:16:59.350
It's not true.

00:16:59.670 --> 00:17:00.480
I am innocent!

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:02.230
I am innocent!

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.210
I knew you wouldn't admit it.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:08.240
Gu Tingzhi.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:10.520
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.619
Wei Hongyu.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.500
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:13.589 --> 00:17:14.839
Wu Jiadong.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.400
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.700
Wang Ji'an.

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:18.880
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:19.680
Zhao Zili.

00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:21.290
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.339
Xiao Dingfeng.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.220
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:34.940
Since Mr. Chen
wishes to serve until his last breath,

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:35.750
you,

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.810
as his followers,

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:42.560
shall share his wish together!

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:43.390
Your Majesty!

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.030
Your Majesty!

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.070
Your Majesty.

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:47.440
Your Majesty.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.240
Your Majesty!

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.200
You're killing the hounds
once the hare is caught!

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.920
If you kill us, your loyal subjects,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.310
who will be left in the court

00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:58.590
to serve you, Your Majesty?

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.760
About that...

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:00.680
Your Majesty!

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.160
It's not your concern.

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.160
Your Majesty!

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:05.980
Your Majesty!

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.280
Eunuch An.

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.690
Summon

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.140
Senior Minister Xu to the hall.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.860
Compared to what concerns
Lord Li and Lord Yang,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.190
I am more worried that,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.640
since these two factions are
both made up of veteran officials,

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.000
if we uproot them all at once,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.380
we young officials

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.090
may struggle to hold the court together.

00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:27.640
Exactly.

00:18:31.530 --> 00:18:33.250
It is time to invite him back

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.200
to take charge.

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.900
I am

00:18:57.610 --> 00:18:58.780
Xu Huaian.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:00.710
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:02.220
Wish you well,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.720
Your Majesty.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.890
[The city fortifications
must be repaired immediately.]

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.260
[Xiadu]

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.570
The Three Armies rebelled this time,

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.960
fighting prefectural garrisons
all the way.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.160
Although we tried our best
to minimize casualties,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.030
many cities were still damaged.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:52.740
I was thinking,

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:55.150
while we're repairing them,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.720
why not sort out
the transportation infrastructure?

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:58.310
Maybe

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:00.590
we can really get Xie Yong'er's

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:03.650
takeout and express delivery business
up and running.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:09.550
She...

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.310
She is my best friend.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.010
Come and take a look.

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:21.280
See where your hometown is.

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.730
My hometown isn't here, either.

00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:43.430
It's okay.

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:45.170
From now on,

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.670
this place

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.640
will be our hometown.

00:20:51.930 --> 00:20:53.400
Why are you still so thin?

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.270
I'll tell the kitchen

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.130
to make you two extra dishes every day.

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:00.020
You're still growing.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:01.180
You need to eat well.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:02.240
Got it?

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:08.440
Your Highness,

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.040
Physician Xiao has arrived.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.410
Your Highness.

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.370
Physician Xiao.

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:16.540
Prince Duan...

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:19.960
Xiahou Bo survived the amputation,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.160
but he still needs to break the fever
and wake up

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.620
before he's out of danger.

00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.410
He really is indestructible.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.080
By the way,

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:32.880
about the "poison against poison" method
we discussed,

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:34.410
have you made any progress?

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:37.110
Regarding the two rare Qiang State poisons
in His Majesty's body,

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:38.240
I have found the remnant

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.900
of the ancient prescription,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.200
but it is incomplete.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.030
There are several ingredients

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:44.480
with extremely strange names.

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.080
As for what they actually are

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:48.000
or whether they exist in the Great Xia,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.330
I have no way of knowing.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.120
Your Highness,

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.840
could you send someone
to the Qiang State to investigate?

00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.450
A round trip

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.080
would take at least 3 months.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.900
I'm afraid His Majesty
can't wait that long.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.440
Physician Xiao,

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.440
can you deduce
the effects of the ingredients

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.570
and find substitutes in the Great Xia?

00:22:10.790 --> 00:22:11.850
Given enough time,

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:12.760
perhaps I can.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:14.790
"Given enough time"?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.610
At least 3 years.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.640
I will send a message to Tu'er right now.

00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:24.710
Let's hope for a miracle.

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:35.060
Your Highness,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.860
regarding Consort Xie...

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.400
Did she leave the palace successfully?

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.210
After she left the palace,

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.650
we lost contact.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.730
Before she left,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.590
she said

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.300
she was going home.

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.650
That is good.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.800
That is good.

00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:14.710
If it is convenient, Your Highness,

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:16.400
please tell Consort Xie

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:19.970
that I have been looking after

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.170
the two angelica plants she left.

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:25.870
Tell her not to worry.

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:32.990
I shall take my leave.

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.180
Hold on.

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:41.440
Before Yong'er set off,

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:43.960
she left a letter for you.

00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.600
For me?

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.960
Tiny Genius.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.640
I remember your surprised expression

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.480
when I called you this for the first time.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.080
It feels like a lifetime ago.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.480
May I have

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.070
your name, Imperial Physician?

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:15.550
My name is Xiao Tiancai.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.640
Tiny Genius?

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.550
You didn't understand
what I meant back then.

00:24:20.550 --> 00:24:21.550
I also didn't know

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.270
that you would be the first person

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:26.000
in this palace
who would truly help and accept me.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.940
In the countless times
I brushed with death,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.460
it was you who fought to get me back.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.250
Hope I still have the chance

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.970
to express the gratitude
I owe you in person.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:41.190
When the dust settles,

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:42.680
if I hear about your visit,

00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.550
I will definitely restore the old bond

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.880
and resume our romance.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.110
From Yong'er.

00:24:57.030 --> 00:24:58.490
Thank you, Your Highness.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.840
I shall take my leave.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:11.240
Yong'er.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:15.110
Just let him think you're out of contact,

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.840
wandering the world.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:21.850
Leave him with a glimmer of hope forever.

00:26:22.270 --> 00:26:23.070
What's wrong?

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.910
Did you have a nightmare?

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:28.350
Do you remember

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.270
when we first met,

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.110
I said

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:34.110
the tyrant in "Devil's Favorite Concubine"

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:36.770
died in an assassination
at the end of the story?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.330
I know who the assassin was now.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:40.150
Who was it?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.330
The original Yu Wanyin

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.340
tried to win Prince Duan back,

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:45.150
so she ended up

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.020
assassinating the Emperor
with a poisoned dagger.

00:26:49.630 --> 00:26:50.190
It was me.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:51.890
I killed you.

00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:59.400
Wanyin.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.990
That was the plot of the original novel.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.090
Xie Yong'er is dead.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.970
Xiahou Bo is crippled, too.

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.600
We've nipped

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.920
all the disasters in the bud.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.490
We've changed our fate.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.920
But the Nameless's letter emphasized

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:20.790
that when two stars meet,
one is destined to fall.

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.590
What he said is

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.480
just some meaningless crap.

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.720
How could it be crap?

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.820
He predicted our arrival

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.180
and Mr. Bei's death.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.700
He predicted everything.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.580
Ignore him.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.460
He's just a charlatan.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:34.850
Look.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.920
What about the five stars align

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.120
he mentioned before?

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.310
Didn't we get over it?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:43.830
Don't overthink it.

00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:44.960
Five stars align...

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.370
Where are you going?

00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:50.610
At least put on a coat.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.110
The last time I saw them,

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.560
their tails were still bent.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:06.890
I thought

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.200
this ordeal was over.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.780
But it turns out

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.160
that it's yet to come.

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:29.070
[Half a month later]

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.720
Why are all these officials

00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.500
coming to meet Her Highness lately?

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.920
His Majesty is critically ill.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:45.610
There must be someone
to handle state affairs.

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:46.920
And the medicine is also

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.790
sent to the Yongyan Hall jar after jar.

00:28:48.790 --> 00:28:50.350
Her Highness supervises
the brewing herself.

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.150
She didn't even have time to eat.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.360
If anything happens to His Majesty,

00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:56.460
the palace

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:58.350
can't withstand any more chaos.

00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:59.720
Don't say that recklessly!

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.650
Get back to work.

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:05.130
Your Highness.

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:07.440
About returning fields to the people,

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:09.240
there is still some dispute in the court.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:09.830
Should we

00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:11.720
delay it for a while?

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:13.490
No need.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:16.200
Proceed as previously planned.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.980
Ask whoever opposes it

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.720
go home and reflect on themselves.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:20.450
Understood.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.100
Your Highness,

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:23.880
I am already working on reopening

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.410
the special imperial exam.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.020
But currently,

00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:28.680
we are short of personnel in the court.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.340
Therefore,

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.430
Senior Minister Xu has drafted
a list of candidates.

00:29:32.430 --> 00:29:35.630
He asked me to present it
to you for review, Your Highness.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.240
Qiu Guangzhi.

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:43.200
Song Yubin.

00:29:44.270 --> 00:29:45.000
Luo Shu.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.000
I have read their essays.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.480
Please tell Senior Minister Xu

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.830
to appoint them exceptionally.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:52.560
Understood.

00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.680
Lord Er,

00:29:59.550 --> 00:30:01.280
do you have anything to report?

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.680
She's about to resign
and live in seclusion.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.410
What else would she have to say?

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.060
You are resigning?

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:12.560
Your Highness,

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:14.500
I am a woman.

00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.180
Although it's only
between a few of us for now,

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:18.640
it's still improper for me

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.110
to serve in the court.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:21.170
How is it improper?

00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:24.160
Wasting a talent
who can benefit the people is

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.490
what's truly improper.

00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:26.280
Exactly.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:28.680
Besides, with His Majesty
and Her Highness here,

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.880
no one in the court would dare to gossip.

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:33.970
Thank you both for your kindness.

00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:36.110
But I've made up my mind to leave.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.080
I hope you can
grant my request, Your Highness.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:50.790
Lord Er,

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.470
could you wait a little longer?

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.160
The court is understaffed right now,

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.590
and His Majesty is critically ill.

00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:58.720
Why don't we give ourselves some time,

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.280
wait until His Majesty recovers,

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.080
and then make a decision?

00:31:26.550 --> 00:31:27.410
Your Highness.

00:31:29.030 --> 00:31:29.960
Physician Xiao,

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.360
where is General Lin?

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.590
General Lin went out of the city
to look for herbs.

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:34.820
He said the Nameless's divination

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.680
can't be wrong.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:37.750
Since the divination says
he can save His Majesty,

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:39.410
then he certainly can make it.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.640
How is His Majesty...

00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.980
How is he doing?

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.350
He had two more episodes last night.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.530
He took the medicine as you instructed

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:48.550
and is currently in a deep sleep.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:52.310
Why is his condition
deteriorating so fast?

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.200
He was able to attend court
just a couple of days ago.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.960
His Majesty's condition is
somewhat similar to Cen Jintian's.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:58.690
Now that everything is settled

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.000
and all obstacles are removed,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.200
the will
that was holding His Majesty up is

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:03.790
gone.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.920
How long does he have?

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:09.250
This poison in the blood

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.850
has affected His Majesty's mobility.

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:13.440
He may be

00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:16.370
unable to move in the next couple of days.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.830
Delirium will follow.

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:19.640
At most...

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.000
At most, he has 10 to 15 days left.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.740
Your Highness.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.000
In that case,

00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:33.710
Physician Xiao,

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.080
please increase his dosage

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.920
and keep him asleep as much as possible.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.120
Don't let him suffer.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.800
Understood.

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:49.570
Won't you go in to see him, Your Highness?

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.120
He said he wants me
to remember him as he was,

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:54.120
not as he is now.

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.940
I respect his wish.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.510
When two stars meet,

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:26.440
one is destined to fall.

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:28.770
Five stars align,

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:36.600
amidst despair, great fortune rises.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.550
For this world,

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.820
losing a mad king

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:44.640
to gain an empress is

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:47.330
quite a bargain.

00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:49.610
Don't talk nonsense.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.270
Only surviving counts
as "amidst despair, great fortune rises."

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:54.880
Wanyin.

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.080
Everyone dies eventually.

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.900
Instead of losing my mind,

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:05.390
wailing for days before I pass away,

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.560
I'd rather die a quick death.

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.210
What do you mean?

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.489
You want me to kill you with my own hands

00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:17.760
like in the original novel?

00:34:20.699 --> 00:34:21.679
Of course not.

00:34:24.070 --> 00:34:24.760
I just don't want

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:26.219
to leave you my worst side.

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:28.920
So you knew it all along, didn't you?

00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:31.250
You knew only one of us could survive.

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:34.949
How could you be so cruel to me?

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.750
You told me you wouldn't leave me alone.

That mute girl

00:38:30.510 --> 00:38:33.170
tried to sneak
into the small pharmacy just now.

00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:39.030
The small pharmacy was

00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.240
remodeled specifically to hide

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.670
His Majesty's illness.

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.540
It's heavily guarded.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:48.010
There's no way
ordinary maids can get close to it.

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.680

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:50.550
I do not know.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:51.980
She is cunning.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.320
She seemed to know
where the other secret guards were

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.760
and moved extremely fast.

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.760
Only I was newly added to today's shift,

00:38:57.760 --> 00:38:59.230
and so was my post.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.600
She did not know that,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.090
so I spotted her movement.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.590
How is it on His Majesty's side?

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:04.800
Don't worry, Your Highness.

00:39:04.800 --> 00:39:06.590
The side hall is impregnable right now.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:07.650
No one can sneak in.

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:09.140
Just to be safe,

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.550
tell the side hall to pour out
all the medicine sent

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:12.630
by the small pharmacy today

00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:13.880

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:14.610
Understood.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.510
I still have a lot to do,

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.740

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.660

00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:06.080
Fetch me an imperial physician.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:07.190
I don't feel well.

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:11.900
It is pointless.

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.360
You are poisoned.

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:20.360
You...

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:23.080
You can speak?

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:32.550
That soup.

00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.250
All day today,

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:39.530
I only ate the soup you brought me.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.520
Take me to the pharmacy.

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.180
Once the Emperor dies,

00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.930
I'll give you the antidote,

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.200
and you can survive.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.880
You are from the Qiang State?

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.280
Yes.

00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:54.500
You entered the palace with me

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:56.550
just to assassinate him?

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:57.910
That is right.

00:41:59.510 --> 00:42:01.320
But after you entered the palace,

00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:03.050
your clothes were all changed.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.480
Where did you get the poison?

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:07.830
Heaven is

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:10.050

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:12.500
What do you mean?

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:15.040
You only have 2 hours left.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:16.550
If we don't go now,

00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.960
you will die.

00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:23.200
I cannot do it.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.230
All of His Majesty's food
and drink is specifically checked.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:29.190
Even if I put poison in the medicine,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:31.150
the imperial physician will find it out.

00:42:31.150 --> 00:42:31.960
He trusts you.

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:33.590
He won't check the medicine

00:42:33.590 --> 00:42:34.320
you give him.

00:42:36.030 --> 00:42:38.150
His Majesty does not have long to live.

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:39.550
Why go to such trouble?

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:41.780
My parents were

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:43.370
the Queen's warriors.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:45.110
But the Emperor killed them.

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:45.710
So,

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
I'll take revenge with my own hands.

00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:53.370
Your Highness.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.940
What brings you here so late at night?

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.510
I'm here
to check on His Majesty's medicine.

00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:59.360
It was just finished

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.670
and ready to be sent over.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:01.930
Flower and I are here.

00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:03.420
You may go and rest.

00:43:04.110 --> 00:43:04.550
Yes.

00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:06.480
The rest of you may leave as well.

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:06.760
Yes.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:07.030
Yes.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.540
It's not too late to change your mind now.

00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:21.960
Put this

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.460
into the medicine.

00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:25.720
Once the Emperor drinks it,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.800
you will survive.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:46.370

Don't move!

00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:53.830
So you knew all along!

00:43:55.110 --> 00:43:57.170
I had hoped my suspicions were wrong.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.440
Where is the antidote?

00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.550
The Qiang State's poison

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.210
has no cure.

00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.740
Your Highness.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:05.260
Should we use torture?

00:44:06.920 --> 00:44:07.660
Forget it.

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:09.150
She isn't lying.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:11.910
Send this packet of drugs

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:12.920
to Physician Xiao

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.210
and see if it helps.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:14.840
Yes.

00:44:19.410 --> 00:44:20.560
Escort me to His Majesty's place.

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:21.560
There are only 2 hours left.

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:22.030
Hurry.
