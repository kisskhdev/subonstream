WEBVTT

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.022
I don't know the right words.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:08.151
Ought to be a septon here.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.284
You were a true knight.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.163
You never beat me
when I didn't deserve it.

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:22.415
Fuck.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.752
Except that time in Maidenpool.

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:31.174
It was the inn boy
ate the widow woman's pie.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:35.178
Not me. I told you.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:37.263
Why, you...

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:45.688
Doesn't matter now.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.998
I'd leave your sword, but it...

00:02:04.624 --> 00:02:06.251
it would only rust in the ground.

00:02:12.674 --> 00:02:14.425
I wish you didn't die, ser.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.600
I'll take good care of the horses.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:40.410
Eat like a king if I sold you three.

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:44.205
For a year or two.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:46.749
Then what?

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.215
That road ends in outlawry or beggary.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:05.977
We could go to a city.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.649
King's Landing? Lannisport?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.040
Could join the City Watch.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.172
Stop raping, ser.

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:47.560
Fits my grip as well as it ever fit his.

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:54.984
And there is a tourney at Ashford Meadow.

00:05:27.452 --> 00:05:29.829
Hello there.
Are you the stableboy?

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:37.128
I want the palfrey rubbed down.

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.630
And oats for all three. You tend to them?

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:42.550
I could, if I wanted.

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:44.510
None of that. See to the horses.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:47.055
You'll get a copper if you do well,
and a clout in the ear if not.

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:59.650
Sit where you like.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:14.082
There's good lamb
roasted with a crust of herbs

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:16.709
and some ducks my son shot down.
Which will you have?

00:06:18.044 --> 00:06:19.087
Both.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:22.924
You're big enough for it.

00:06:34.352 --> 00:06:36.687
- How much farther to Ashford?
- Day's ride.

00:06:39.023 --> 00:06:41.359
Is my boy seeing to your horses
or has he run off again?

00:06:43.027 --> 00:06:44.028
No, he's there.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:45.822
Half the town's gone down the tourney.

00:06:45.905 --> 00:06:47.532
Mine would, too, if I allowed it.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.700
I swear, I couldn't tell you why.

00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.994
Knights are built the same as other men.

00:06:53.037 --> 00:06:55.748
And I never knew a joust
to change the price of eggs.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.586
Bound for the tourney yourself?

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:02.088
I dreamed of you.

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.722
Stay the fuck away from me. You hear?

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:14.350
My lord?

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:39.625
Never you mind that one, ser.

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.169
I'll see about your food.

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:53.181
Hiya! Take that! Yah!

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:57.977
Oi!

00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.479
My lord.

00:07:59.979 --> 00:08:02.607
- You thief!
- I did not mean to offend you.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.067
Take that armor off you. Now!

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:08.613
And be glad Thunder didn't kick you
in that fool head of yours.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.448
He's a war horse, not a boy's pony.

00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:12.241
I could ride him as well as you.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:14.494
Close your insolent mouth.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:16.162
I--

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.456
I'm a knight, I'll have you know.

00:08:18.539 --> 00:08:20.208
You don't look to be a knight.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:24.212
- What, all knights look the same, do they?
- No.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.172
But they don't look like you either.

00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:28.591
Your belt's made of rope.

00:08:29.967 --> 00:08:32.470
So long as it holds
my scabbard, it serves.

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:35.932
Are you going to the tourney, then?
Do you mean to enter the lists?

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.226
Yeah, I suppose I do.

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.229
Take me with you, ser. Please.

00:08:41.312 --> 00:08:43.064
And what might your mother say to that?

00:08:43.147 --> 00:08:44.440
Not much.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:45.858
She's dead.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:47.818
Is the innkeeper not your...

00:08:50.613 --> 00:08:51.989
You're an orphan boy.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:53.074
Are you?

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.078
I was. Once.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.288
Till my ser took me in.

00:09:00.915 --> 00:09:02.708
Taught me arms and riding, and...

00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.379
and taught me everything, really.

00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:09.423
Best he could.

00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:13.135
If you could bring me to Ashford,
I could squire for you, ser.

00:09:13.219 --> 00:09:15.888
And you can teach me best you can.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.057
No, I have no need for a squire, lad.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.850
Every knight needs a squire.

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.687
And you look like you need one
more than most.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.358
And you look like you need
a good clout in the ear.

00:09:28.734 --> 00:09:29.944
Fill me a sack of oats.

00:09:30.027 --> 00:09:32.238
I'm off for Ashford. Alone.

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.746
Look, lad, I promise you...

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.166
you're better off not squiring
for the likes of me.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.467
For your help.

00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:57.972
Sulk all you wish.

00:09:58.055 --> 00:09:59.932
I know you'll scoop it up
as soon as I'm gone.

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:42.576
Sorry.

00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.127
Piss off.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:52.461
Beg pardon, men.

00:11:54.338 --> 00:11:56.465
I wish to speak
to the master of the games.

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:06.392
Oh!

00:12:07.643 --> 00:12:08.644
What do you want, man?

00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.480
Got you again!

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.024
I came for the tourney.

00:12:15.192 --> 00:12:17.987
My lord's tourney
is a contest for knights.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.447
- You a knight?
- Hyah!

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:21.574
Oi! Psst!

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.037
A knight with a name, mayhaps?

00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:29.623
Dunk.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:32.293
Ser Dunk.

00:12:33.669 --> 00:12:37.465
I was squire to Ser Arlan of Pennytree
since I was a boy.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:41.761
He knighted me before he passed,
with his own sword.

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.058
That's his penny there in the hilt.

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.980
Well, a sword it is for a certainty.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.066
But I've never heard
of this Arlan of Pennytree.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:57.443
You were his squire, you say?

00:12:57.526 --> 00:12:59.945
He always meant for me
to be a knight one day...

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:02.156
as he was.

00:13:03.157 --> 00:13:04.867
Am I to be a knight one day, ser?

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.077
As you are?

00:13:12.333 --> 00:13:15.044
When he was dying,
he called for his longsword

00:13:15.127 --> 00:13:16.378
and bade me kneel.

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:19.215
Charged me to be a good knight.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.009
To defend the weak and the innocent.

00:13:23.552 --> 00:13:27.056
Serve the realm with all my might.
And I swore that I would.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.022
Any knight can make a knight, it's true.

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:38.275
Were there witnesses to your dubbing?

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:40.736
Only a robin in a thorn tree.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.242
This is Ashford town, lad.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:50.496
Know what comes to men here
who pretend at sacred oaths?

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.706
- I'm not--
- We hang you

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.292
naked by your hands and your feet...

00:13:56.293 --> 00:13:59.713
lower you down asshole first
onto a sharpened point

00:13:59.797 --> 00:14:01.298
and fuck you dry.

00:14:02.091 --> 00:14:05.302
Call it the Ashford chair.
So, I ask you again.

00:14:05.386 --> 00:14:08.722
Were there witnesses to your dubbing
besides a fuckin' songbird?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:13.894
Well, the-- see, it was raining.

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:17.189
I'm bullshitting you.

00:14:21.735 --> 00:14:22.987
"Ashford chair."

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.447
You take a boot to the head?

00:14:25.531 --> 00:14:27.533
This is the Reach, not the Riverlands.

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:29.660
- "Ashford chair."
- Think we're fending off

00:14:29.743 --> 00:14:33.163
some scourge of cottagers,
scuttling about, entering tourneys?

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.459
You'd need coin.

00:14:38.335 --> 00:14:40.379
Armor. Horses. Men.

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:42.339
Training, gods be good.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:46.635
Imagine the poor farmer charging down
Lyonel Baratheon in the lists.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:48.137
Mm, that would be--

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.680
A different sort of entertainment.

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:52.641
Mm. Well, I'm no farmer.

00:14:52.725 --> 00:14:54.268
Yet you've come dressed as one.

00:14:57.187 --> 00:15:00.149
Look, man, my Lord Ashford

00:15:00.232 --> 00:15:03.527
fancies himself of great import.
Gods know why.

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:05.988
Well, that means I'm to ward off
every landed knight

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:07.823
and sellsword vying to challenge.

00:15:07.907 --> 00:15:10.200
You understand? There are princes about.

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.287
No, of course.

00:15:21.795 --> 00:15:22.922
Your late master.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.760
He'll be known to the true knights
here assembled?

00:15:28.886 --> 00:15:32.932
There was a pavilion
flying the banner of House Dondarrion.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:34.850
Aye, Ser Manfred of that house.

00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.937
Ser Arlan served
his lord father in Dorne a few years past.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:39.605
Ser Manfred will remember us.

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.899
By scent alone, no doubt.

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:44.443
If he'll speak to your good honor,
bring him here with you

00:15:44.526 --> 00:15:45.986
before the tourney begins on the morrow.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.112
Leave your escorts behind.

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.282
- As you say.
- Aye.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:55.746
You are aware that those
vanquished in tourney

00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:59.375
forfeit their arms, armor, and horse
to the victors, and must ransom them back?

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:01.418
- Aye.
- And you have coin

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:03.921
- to pay such ransom?
- Oh, gods, no.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:07.716
I mean, I won't have need of coin.

00:16:11.553 --> 00:16:12.554
Ah!

00:16:12.846 --> 00:16:14.014
Seven fu--

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:37.329
Mind those two. Good girl.

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:45.254
Pardon, sers.
I need speak with Ser Manfred.

00:16:45.337 --> 00:16:46.463
Good.

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:49.591
He's napping, ser. Wake him for a stag.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:51.510
I...

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.346
I don't have a stag.

00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:56.390
What kind of knight don't got a stag?

00:16:56.473 --> 00:16:58.767
- It's a hedge knight, ain't it?
- What?

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:01.020
It's like a knight, but sadder.

00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.646
No, I'm-- I'm not sad--

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:04.940
He's gotta sleep in the hedges
'cause no lord'll have it.

00:17:05.024 --> 00:17:07.234
Aw. That is sad.

00:17:07.985 --> 00:17:10.112
And Ser Manfred's fucked its wife, too.

00:17:10.195 --> 00:17:13.157
- No, I don't have a wife.
- Oh!

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:15.117
'Cause we're used
to husbands coming 'round.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.744
Likes fucking wives, that one.

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.495
Near as much as he likes fucking us.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.415
Told me he's on a mission
to turn the whole world red.

00:17:21.498 --> 00:17:24.376
- Well, we're already red.
- So we are.

00:17:27.046 --> 00:17:31.508
Well, when do you expect
Ser Manfred to wake, then?

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:34.678
It might wanna try back at evenfall.

00:17:34.762 --> 00:17:36.138
Evenfall.

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:40.434
- Goodbye.
- Yeah.

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:43.270
Arse.

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.444
Why'd she say that, huh?

00:17:52.529 --> 00:17:53.697
We're not sad.

00:17:57.159 --> 00:17:59.787
Certainly not
rising-to-the-level-of-a-comment sad.

00:18:01.205 --> 00:18:03.457
Besides, Ser Arlan always said that...

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.877
a hedge knight
was the truest kind of knight.

00:18:08.879 --> 00:18:11.673
When we win our first tilt,
we'll have the loser's armor

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.967
and horse, or his gold.

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:15.928
Won't be sad then.

00:18:22.851 --> 00:18:25.479
I know. Said if we did win.

00:18:27.064 --> 00:18:30.109
Look, it's not a crime against the king
to enjoy a nice thought for a trice.

00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:34.738
Do not muck about with me, Raymun.

00:18:35.906 --> 00:18:38.033
You're a good-for-nothing useless rat.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:50.921
What are you gawping at,
you blue-eyed cunt?

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:55.801
That's a longsword you wear?

00:18:58.554 --> 00:18:59.972
Yes, it is mine by right.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.057
That's an odd thing to say.

00:19:05.185 --> 00:19:08.313
I'm Ser Steffon Fossoway.
Come try me.

00:19:09.398 --> 00:19:11.900
As you see,
me cousin here is not ripe yet.

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:13.652
Do it, ser.

00:19:13.735 --> 00:19:16.530
I may not be ripe,
but my cousin's rotten to the core.

00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:18.323
- Knock the seeds out of him.
- Quiet!

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:24.413
I thank you,
but I have matters to attend.

00:19:24.496 --> 00:19:26.874
What, matters of the hedge,
I have no doubt.

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:31.295
Fucking size of ya.

00:19:31.378 --> 00:19:34.506
Stupid bastard. Ser Grance!

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.848
Perhaps we should seek
quieter accommodations.

00:20:32.397 --> 00:20:34.524
Oh. Fuck.

00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.000
He's napping still.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:54.503
- Still?
- Mm.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.880
On account of his gouty toes.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:02.302
One of life's absurd little miseries,
to be sure.

00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:06.890
Makes for restless nights.
The poor dear.

00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:08.725
Right, absolutely. It's just...

00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.852
Well, it is of some urgency
that I speak with him,

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.814
so I may enter the lists on the morrow.

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:18.026
- What's this?
- It means the joust.

00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:19.653
Awful dangerous, that.

00:21:19.736 --> 00:21:20.988
Yes, well...

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.700
I'm not troubled with
a wealth of options, am I?

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.369
And if I mean
to take service in a castle--

00:21:27.452 --> 00:21:30.330
It must put its body at hazard
for the pleasure of strangers.

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:31.581
Ain't that our job?

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:35.210
Ah! Shut up!
You're meant to be dead.

00:21:36.837 --> 00:21:39.506
Find a safer trade, lad.
You'll be happier for it.

00:21:40.215 --> 00:21:41.925
One whore to another.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:47.889
Must you mock me?

00:21:48.849 --> 00:21:50.392
I was only asking for a bit of help.

00:21:51.476 --> 00:21:53.562
I'll try Ser Manfred back in the morning.

00:21:55.439 --> 00:21:56.523
Sorry, lad.

00:21:57.107 --> 00:21:59.318
Aye. We don't mean to mock you.

00:21:59.401 --> 00:22:02.487
We see plenty of green boys every tourney.

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.240
All with glory in their minds,
but never in their hands.

00:22:05.824 --> 00:22:08.327
Well, perhaps I will be different.

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:14.875
Be good to your body, knight.
Last one you're like to have.

00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:27.763
Our brave hero forges on,
leaving all he knows behind.

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:33.185
A father and a friend,
may seem the world unkind.

00:22:34.686 --> 00:22:38.732
Fate has set his lonely path
through corridors of chance.

00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:44.488
A boy from nothing risks it all,
ignoring looks askance.

00:22:44.571 --> 00:22:49.326
Perhaps he's only stupid
holding fast his mirror shield.

00:22:50.077 --> 00:22:55.248
Great honor his ambition,
must keep a truth concealed.

00:22:55.332 --> 00:22:59.878
For if his humble shape is bared,
a foul and fiery demise.

00:23:00.379 --> 00:23:04.883
Should the dragon discover
none but a man in great disguise.

00:23:39.584 --> 00:23:41.586
Halfman! Halfman!

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:45.215
Do I look like a half man to you?

00:23:45.298 --> 00:23:48.009
Aye. Half man, half giant.

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:49.553
Look, I'm sorry.

00:23:49.636 --> 00:23:51.680
I should not have urged you
to try my cousin.

00:23:51.763 --> 00:23:55.016
He'd have broken your hand
or a knee, if he could.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:56.935
He likes to batter men in the yard,

00:23:57.018 --> 00:23:59.062
you know, in case
he meets them in the lists.

00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:02.399
He did not break you.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:04.276
I'm his blood.

00:24:04.901 --> 00:24:06.987
Though he is the senior branch
of the apple tree,

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:08.738
which he never ceases to remind me.

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:12.826
Will you and your cousin
ride in the tourney?

00:24:12.909 --> 00:24:17.080
He will. I would that I could,
but I'm only a squire.

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.752
Fight well for a squire.

00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:27.883
You have the look of a challenger.
Whose shield do you mean to strike?

00:24:30.719 --> 00:24:32.471
Makes no difference.

00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:34.306
That's what you're supposed to say.

00:24:39.186 --> 00:24:41.271
Though it makes
all the difference in the world.

00:24:44.483 --> 00:24:45.484
You hungry?

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:47.986
Always.

00:25:12.093 --> 00:25:15.013
Lyonel Baratheon.
The Laughing Storm, they call him.

00:25:16.932 --> 00:25:18.391
I thought he'd be bigger.

00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:20.727
Four thousand years ago...

00:25:21.978 --> 00:25:24.105
- Four thousand years...
- Where are you going?

00:25:24.189 --> 00:25:27.442
...ago-- cunts. I can't hear myself.

00:25:28.068 --> 00:25:32.489
I've had a profound thought,
if anyone would care to listen.

00:25:36.284 --> 00:25:38.620
Four thousand years ago,

00:25:38.703 --> 00:25:44.334
our ancestors gathered
in that big field outside

00:25:44.417 --> 00:25:48.838
to blood each other with sticks
and have a little bit of gay fun.

00:25:48.922 --> 00:25:52.467
And they say it was
this country's first-ever joust.

00:25:52.551 --> 00:25:54.094
Well, I say...

00:26:00.934 --> 00:26:01.935
The fuck was I gonna say?

00:26:02.018 --> 00:26:03.937
"First-ever joust..."

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:06.565
Ah.

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:12.821
Men could not have devised such a joy.

00:26:15.865 --> 00:26:16.950
So, who was it?

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:21.663
Huh?

00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:23.748
Who was it?

00:26:34.384 --> 00:26:37.929
Fuck it. A hundred gold to the man,
beast, or god who sticks me best.

00:26:39.472 --> 00:26:42.934
Now, eat your birds so we can dance!

00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:47.957
You ever been punched in the face before?

00:27:50.168 --> 00:27:51.836
I beg your pardon, Ser Lyonel?

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.715
Big men get punched more than little men.
Did you know that?

00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:59.969
No, but I believe it.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.809
That why you slouch?
So you don't get punched?

00:28:05.892 --> 00:28:08.186
I don't slouch.

00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:12.816
Oh, you've been cowering all evening
like a maiden on her wedding night.

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:18.113
I meant no disrespect, ser, honest.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:21.783
Where I grew up,
you learn to go unnoticed, is all.

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:24.452
The seven above gave you tallness.

00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:26.705
So, be tall.

00:28:28.123 --> 00:28:30.875
Or I will name you a heretic and burn you.

00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:35.755
Drown you. Drop you off a tall pl--

00:28:35.839 --> 00:28:37.674
I don't know.
What do they do to heretics?

00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:40.218
Burn them, my lord.

00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:41.344
Fine.

00:28:42.053 --> 00:28:43.596
What have you brought me?

00:28:49.352 --> 00:28:53.732
Ser, I-- beggin' your pardons.
I didn't realize.

00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:56.985
You wish to curry my favor some.

00:28:58.445 --> 00:29:00.071
Yet you come with an empty hand.

00:29:04.659 --> 00:29:06.035
Lord Cafferen,

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:07.954
the smug cunt in red...

00:29:09.456 --> 00:29:11.541
he is scarce to pay his rents.

00:29:11.624 --> 00:29:16.087
His people starve each winter,
yet even he shinied up this...

00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:19.340
bauble from his family's cellars,

00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:22.343
for he understands
that all men, in their way,

00:29:22.427 --> 00:29:25.930
wish only for your help, or your head.

00:29:28.892 --> 00:29:30.518
You've come for my head, then.

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:33.646
What?

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.065
No! No.

00:29:36.566 --> 00:29:40.403
Then, why the fuck are you in my tent?

00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:46.659
Supper.

00:29:59.672 --> 00:30:00.715
Alright.

00:30:02.884 --> 00:30:04.511
Actually makes sense.

00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:06.930
- Supper.
- What is your name, man?

00:30:08.765 --> 00:30:10.016
Dunk-- Ser Dunk.

00:30:10.099 --> 00:30:11.476
That's ridiculous.

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:17.941
Do you like dancing?

00:30:18.024 --> 00:30:19.984
Doesn't everyone?

00:30:21.402 --> 00:30:24.364
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:49.407
The swells heaved.
You could lick salt from the air.

00:31:51.117 --> 00:31:54.287
But I'd come to find what men do
when they die at sea.

00:31:56.039 --> 00:31:59.042
So, drove I on into the storm.

00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:06.466
- Weren't you afraid?
- Ahh.

00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:11.971
Within every man, there are many men.

00:32:13.765 --> 00:32:15.183
Mm.

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:18.937
But that I had to do,
Stormlanders had always done.

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.065
And if they had done it,
I could do it, too.

00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:24.275
Hm.

00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:27.028
You know, it's best not to agonize.

00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:33.409
Yeah, I agonize a lot.

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:35.703
Mm.

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.790
Sometimes, I think I agonize too much,

00:32:38.873 --> 00:32:41.334
and I just end up agonizing over that.

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.711
Mm.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.881
I'm quick and strong, sure.

00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.509
- Sure.
- But so are you.

00:32:49.592 --> 00:32:50.593
Sure.

00:32:50.677 --> 00:32:53.096
Plus, you've trained sword and lance

00:32:53.179 --> 00:32:55.515
with the finest masters-at-arms
in the realm.

00:32:55.598 --> 00:32:56.683
I mean...

00:32:57.725 --> 00:33:00.645
what chance do I have? Truly?

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.147
Oh, you have no chance.

00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:14.158
But it's a great honor to test oneself
against a worthy foe.

00:33:16.452 --> 00:33:19.288
- No disrespect, ser.
- Mm.

00:33:19.372 --> 00:33:20.832
That's easy for you to say.

00:33:20.915 --> 00:33:24.335
You have a name, an inheritance.

00:33:24.419 --> 00:33:28.214
One loss, and I won't be able
to ransom back my own horse.

00:33:35.263 --> 00:33:37.515
A knight without a horse
is no knight at all.

00:33:38.391 --> 00:33:40.393
- Aye.
- Mm.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:45.189
So, what should I do?

00:33:49.694 --> 00:33:51.112
I don't know.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.700
I'm really quite drunk.

00:34:04.125 --> 00:34:05.126
Okay.

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.211
Thanks.

00:34:11.257 --> 00:34:12.133
Sorry.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.615
Ser Arlan of Pennytree.

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:38.701
He served your Lord Father

00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:40.828
to hunt the Vulture King
in the Red Mountains.

00:34:41.621 --> 00:34:42.747
I was only a boy, but--

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:44.332
I thought you said you were a Dornishman.

00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:47.668
No, he said he's hung like a Dornishman.

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:50.421
No, I said I've hung Dornishmen.

00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.675
Perhaps we would speak on the morn.

00:34:54.759 --> 00:34:56.427
I know your penny knight not.

00:34:56.511 --> 00:34:58.971
Nor you, brother. Be gone.

00:35:03.142 --> 00:35:06.187
But Ser Arlan took a wound
in your father's service.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:07.605
How could you have forgotten him?

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:13.820
My lord father took 800 swords
into those mountains.

00:35:13.903 --> 00:35:17.156
We've forgotten men
who reaped much more than a wound.

00:35:17.949 --> 00:35:20.827
Please, ser,
I will not be allowed to challenge

00:35:20.910 --> 00:35:23.371
unless a knight
or a lord will vouch for me.

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:24.622
And what is that to me?

00:35:51.023 --> 00:35:52.150
You!

00:35:53.651 --> 00:35:54.652
What...

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.239
What are you doing?

00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:01.117
Cooking a fish. Do you want some?

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:05.913
No! I mean, how did you get here?
Did you steal a horse?

00:36:05.997 --> 00:36:07.748
I rode in the back of a lamb cart.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.084
Lamb cart.

00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:14.130
- Well, you best find another one.
- You can't make me go.

00:36:14.213 --> 00:36:16.007
I'd had enough of that inn.

00:36:16.090 --> 00:36:19.468
Now, listen, I'll have no more
insolence from you, boy.

00:36:19.552 --> 00:36:22.180
I should throw you over my horse
and take you home.

00:36:22.263 --> 00:36:24.724
You'd need to ride all the way
to King's Landing.

00:36:24.807 --> 00:36:27.268
- You'd miss the tourney.
- King's Landing?

00:36:28.269 --> 00:36:30.188
- You're from Flea Bottom?
- No.

00:36:31.939 --> 00:36:32.940
Aye.

00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:42.033
What are those doing there?

00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:43.534
I washed them.

00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:46.579
I made the fire, caught the fish,
and groomed the horses.

00:36:46.662 --> 00:36:49.832
I would have raised your pavilion,
but I couldn't find one.

00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:53.336
- There's my pavilion.
- That's a tree.

00:36:53.419 --> 00:36:56.005
Yes, and it's all the pavilion
a true knight needs.

00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:59.884
I'd sooner sleep under the stars
than in some smoky tent.

00:37:01.552 --> 00:37:02.845
What if it rains?

00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:05.223
The tree will shelter me.

00:37:05.306 --> 00:37:06.390
Trees leak.

00:37:09.018 --> 00:37:10.603
So they do.

00:37:10.686 --> 00:37:11.938
What's your name?

00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:15.524
- Dunk.
- Ser Dunk.

00:37:15.608 --> 00:37:18.945
That's no name for a knight.
Is it short for Duncan?

00:37:19.779 --> 00:37:21.906
Yeah. Yes.

00:37:21.989 --> 00:37:23.699
Ser Duncan of...

00:37:29.705 --> 00:37:31.165
Ser Duncan the Tall.

00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:33.709
Never heard of him.

00:37:33.793 --> 00:37:35.670
Do you know every knight
in the Seven Kingdoms, then?

00:37:35.753 --> 00:37:37.129
The good ones.

00:37:40.007 --> 00:37:42.385
- You got a name, thief?
- Egg.

00:37:42.468 --> 00:37:43.469
Egg.

00:37:45.179 --> 00:37:48.933
Well, Egg, by rights,
I should beat you bloody,

00:37:49.016 --> 00:37:50.309
send you on your way.

00:37:52.103 --> 00:37:53.896
But you look as though you don't eat much.

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:57.400
And if you'll swear
to do as you're told...

00:37:59.652 --> 00:38:01.153
I'll let you serve me for the tourney.

00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:05.157
After that, well...

00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:08.744
we'll see.

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:15.293
I don't have much,
but if you prove worth your keep...

00:38:16.919 --> 00:38:19.255
you'll have clothes on your back
and food in your belly.

00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:22.800
The clothes might be
rough-spun and the food,

00:38:22.883 --> 00:38:24.885
salt beef and salt fish,

00:38:24.969 --> 00:38:26.220
but you won't go hungry.

00:38:28.139 --> 00:38:29.765
I promise not to beat you.

00:38:31.058 --> 00:38:32.643
Except when you deserve it.

00:38:33.644 --> 00:38:34.687
Yes, my lord.

00:38:36.355 --> 00:38:37.356
"Ser."

00:38:39.233 --> 00:38:40.651
I'm only a hedge knight.

00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:55.916
A falling star brings luck
to those who see it.

00:38:58.336 --> 00:39:00.212
Go to sleep, boy.

00:39:00.296 --> 00:39:03.382
All the other knights
are in their pavilions by now,

00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:05.885
staring up at silk instead of sky.

00:39:08.054 --> 00:39:09.680
Do you want a clout in the ear?

00:39:20.733 --> 00:39:22.818
So, the luck is ours alone?
