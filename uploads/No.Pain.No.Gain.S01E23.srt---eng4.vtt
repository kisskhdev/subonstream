=Episode 23=
(This story is purely fictional.)

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.110
Start with employee talks.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.940
Move on to employee training.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.030
Talks during the day.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.270
Training at night.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.470
Starting tomorrow,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.524
everyone will need to adapt
to a new work schedule.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.550
We cannot keep being as lax as before.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.230
Is this insane or what?

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.635
No, what is this supposed to be?

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.300
Mingliang.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.230
In Tengda,

00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:21.490
you're the one I have
the highest expectations for.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.830
At Tengda Games,

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:24.950
you're the most senior,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.302
and the strongest backbone
in terms of capability.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.420
The road to success is never busy.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.700
It's just that most people

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.990
choose comfort instead.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.790
On the road of life,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.110
you've already
missed many opportunities.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:41.830
Today,

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.900
I want you to seriously ask yourself,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.070
have you shown gratitude?

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.510
- I have.
- I have.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:49.950
But right now,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.620
the company's resources
are all leaning toward Lin Wan.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.740
I think that's extremely unfair to you.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.390
You're a sensible person.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.550
A sensible person

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.620
should understand

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.700
what's meant to be understood.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.140
I'm a sensible person, too.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.300
So some things

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.102
only need to be clear
between the two of us.

00:03:08.102 --> 00:03:08.990
You understand, right?

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.420
No, I don't understand.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:12.950
Can you explain it more clearly?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.790
Why does this stick
feel a bit too light?

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.070
Lower your voice.

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.670
Listen. This was arranged by Mr. Pei.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.550
I secretly moved it over from the set.
It's a prop made of foam wood.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.270
Really?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.550
Mr. Pei

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.550
schedules something
for us every single day.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.670
It's not easy on him, either.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:30.990
Why does this feel

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.670
like my old slacking-off style
all over again?

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.270
We need to sell it better.

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.270
Look over there.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.420
That's all it takes to break you?

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.270
I can't take it.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:47.550
Get it together.

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.270
Log on your shoulder.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.740
One, two, three.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.740
Move.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.990
Lin Wan.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.420
At Tengda,

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.020
you're the one I believe in most.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.550
You stand out across the entire company.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.740
Your ability far surpasses Lv's.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.070
Right now,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.950
can you see how the team has changed

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:08.740
and grown?

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.510
And what can you

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.580
give back to the team?

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:12.700
(Tengda Games)

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.230
But from what I know,

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.150
Lv

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.230
has long been

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.230
a project leader at Tengda Games.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:21.260
Still, I think

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.180
you're the one who should be

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.180
steering Tengda Games.

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:25.790
Come on, Mr. Tu,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.500
are you trying to start office politics?

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.260
Drive a wedge between me and Lv?

00:04:35.146 --> 00:04:36.590
(Learn Gratitude, Strengthen the Team)
Let's use

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.300
(Tengda Heart-Power Team Building)
truck tire drills

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:39.790
to build endurance

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.590
and reinforce belief.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.790
Every push of that massive tire

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.260
hardens your will.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.230
The tire crushed my foot.

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.550
Are you okay?

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.820
It hurts.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.990
Mr. Pei did it.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.500
He pulled an all-nighter

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.110
and swapped all the tires.

00:05:09.435 --> 00:05:10.740
You can push them easily now.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.620
Who did this?

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.940
Sibo.

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.740
Come here.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.940
Mr. Tu.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.030
Sit.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.620
An '82 vintage.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.180
Sibo.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:39.940
At Tengda,

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.420
you're the one I value the most.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.110
I know

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.740
there's a lot of work,

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.380
and Mr. Sui has his arrangements.

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:49.790
But

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.180
you know

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:53.860
Mr. Sui.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.670
He's not very mature.

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.260
So,

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.710
I hope you

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.030
take initiative and think for yourself.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.990
Have your own judgment.

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.940
In the company,

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:08.500
who should you talk to more?

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:10.260
You get it, right?

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.550
What do you mean?

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.110
I mean

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.180
exactly what you think I mean.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.620
Mr. Tu's meaning.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:27.150
Mr. Sui's meaning.

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.300
Mr. Pei's meaning.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:30.550
My meaning.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:31.990
You know, that meaning...

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.740
(Movement Is Action)

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:42.670
Mr. Sui,

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:43.670
I really can't do this.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.102
I'm afraid of heights. I'm scared.

00:06:45.102 --> 00:06:46.820
My legs are shaking.

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.740
Mr. Sui, he's really terrified.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.746
I'm not afraid of heights.
Let me do it instead.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.110
I can switch in.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:53.990
There's no need
for everyone to try, right?

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.790
Exactly.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.670
I'm fine too.

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.670
Remember this.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.230
Your greatest enemy
is never your opponent.

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:00.740
It's fear.

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.740
What? That's nonsense.

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.670
Say it out loud!

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:04.790
Who is your enemy?

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:05.790
Fear.

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.150
I really am scared.

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.110
Trust each other.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:10.740
Trust the team.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.550
Adjust your mindset.

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:14.670
Believe in the team's strength.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.550
It's okay.

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:36.420
You're fine.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.910
Are you trying to start a mutiny?

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.590
Spare them.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:09.420
Mr. Sui.

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.150
This site,

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.790
along with all training grounds
around Jinchuan,

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:15.670
has been booked by Mr. Li Jr.

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:16.740
From now on,

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.470
you won't be training here anymore.

00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:36.460
(Shenhua International)

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.230
The training got shut down
because of Pei Qian.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:44.500
He's never been the obedient type.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.620
I just don't get it.

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:46.900
What does Father even see in him?

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.620
Every single one of these employees

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:50.830
worships him too much.

00:08:51.168 --> 00:08:52.235
If, from now on,

00:08:52.235 --> 00:08:54.590
once they are out there,
the ruler's orders are no longer obeyed,

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:55.740
how could that be acceptable?

00:08:58.470 --> 00:09:00.110
I need to rein them in.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.900
If anyone's doing that, it'll be me.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.990
Sui,

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.500
management is an art.

00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:09.140
You can learn it from me, slowly.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.780
Why do I have to learn from you?

00:09:11.546 --> 00:09:13.190
- I've thought it through.
- I've got it figured out.

00:09:13.213 --> 00:09:14.260
- They can't stay
- They need to leave

00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.740
- their original positions.
- their comfort zones.

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:16.590
- Split them up.
- Break them apart.

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.591
- Divide and manage.
- Disrupt them.

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.740
We actually...

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.660
You go first.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:23.710
No, you go first.

00:09:23.924 --> 00:09:25.350
We're thinking the same thing.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.620
Here they go again.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:51.020
Everyone.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.350
After discussion with Mr. Sui,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:54.710
Tengda

00:09:55.230 --> 00:09:57.350
will soon implement company-wide

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.710
cross-department rotation.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.350
Effective immediately,

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:04.430
department heads will rotate at random,

00:10:04.613 --> 00:10:06.140
with hands-on frontline assignments.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.620
Frontline?

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:13.140
Cross-department rotation?

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:15.350
Random rotation?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.230
Frontline assignments?

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:18.620
Mr. Pei.

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:25.470
Mr. Tu. Mr. Sui.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:26.230
Let's talk.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:35.950
Are those two idiots?

00:10:54.435 --> 00:10:55.502
Please, have a seat.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.470
Mr. Pei.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.990
Gentlemen, please sit.

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:06.350
You didn't notify me in advance,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.110
so I'm formally notifying you now.

00:11:08.168 --> 00:11:09.620
The cross-department rotation, right?

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:11.710
I do not approve of it.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.110
Mr. Pei, here's the situation.

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:14.310
Under labor law,

00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:15.860
if an employer forces a reassignment,

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.590
employees have the right to refuse.

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.230
And Tengda's business scope

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.110
is very broad.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.990
Arbitrary reassignment

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.950
could easily bring

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.350
Tengda's operations to a halt.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.830
At present, everyone at Tengda

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:28.860
is already placed

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.350
where they are most effective.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:31.860
So I truly don't understand

00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:33.860
why the two of you
insist on this rotation.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:35.830
Daring to voice

00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.830
a different opinion

00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:37.950
is a good thing.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.430
I think highly of you.

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:40.830
Mr. Tu.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:42.470
Let's not beat around the bush.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:43.830
Straight to it.

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:45.990
I do not approve
of cross-department rotation.

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:47.710
Since Mr. Pei objects,

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.324
let's settle it with a fair vote.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:50.860
Sure. Everyone at Tengda?

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:52.230
No, just the three of us.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:53.635
All in favor, raise your hand.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.900
Two to one.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:01.950
Doing this,

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:04.110
does your father know?

00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:08.020
Mr. Pei,

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.860
just like Father,

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:11.350
I admire you.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:13.620
But right now,

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.620
you've lost sight of your place.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.470
You clash with us,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.500
and then ask whether Father knows?

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:25.860
That's ridiculous.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:27.830
He's my father.

00:12:40.768 --> 00:12:42.302
(Special Assistant)

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.990
Get me all of Mr. Sima's addresses,

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.380
anywhere in this world or beyond!

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.470
I have to find him.

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:56.070
Mr. Pei sent a message.

00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:58.230
Sorry, everyone.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.110
About this matter,

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:00.740
I'll find a solution
as soon as possible.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.260
Regarding the reassignment,

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.620
please bear with it for now.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.380
If anyone truly can't accept it,

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.470
you may terminate
your contract with Tengda.

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.140
The company will compensate you.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.740
And if things return to normal,

00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.380
you'll always be welcome back.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.980
(Qian. Waiting for the other party
to accept the invitation.)

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:26.710
No answer?

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.190
Sima Fu, Tu, Sui,

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:36.380
those three clowns.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:38.380
They're just shareholders.

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.710
Mr. Pei is the founder of Tengda.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:42.740
By rights,

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:44.660
Mr. Pei should be
the largest shareholder.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.740
So why does he have to

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.070
lower his head for now?

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.780
Do you think

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:52.780
they've got something

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.900
on Mr. Pei, or leverage?

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.500
Did Mr. Pei borrow money from them?

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:01.310
Could Mr. Pei be Sima Five?

00:14:01.346 --> 00:14:02.860
A loser? What loser?
[* Five sounds like "loser" in Chinese.]

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:03.813
Five. The fifth one.

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:05.350
The fifth brother.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:10.710
Come here. I need to talk to you.

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.990
Actually,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.110
I've known Mr. Pei since college.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:16.857
We're brothers through thick and thin.

00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.590
We already knew that.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:20.990
That's not exactly news.

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:21.620
Don't interrupt.

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:22.900
Who cares about underwear?

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:23.740
Get to the point.

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.457
What does this
have to do with Sima Five?

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:29.740
Mr. Pei is actually a rich kid
who started his own business.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:34.470
Back then, he was like this.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:45.740
Families like that

00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:47.620
are usually very complicated.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.950
In Mr. Pei's case,

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.110
even more so.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.350
So this is

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:54.660
brothers by different surnames
fighting over the inheritance?

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.346
So who is the illegitimate child?

00:14:56.368 --> 00:14:56.830
Mr. Pei,

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:58.540
or those Sima brothers?

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.140
Could be a blended family.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:04.380
Qian's father really isn't
what he looks like.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.110
Four kids, none sharing his surname,

00:15:07.110 --> 00:15:08.660
and he's still so upbeat.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.950
Hard to imagine.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.950
Tengda's structure is so flat,

00:15:14.102 --> 00:15:16.190
yet the relationships
at the top are this tangled.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.740
If that's really the case, then...

00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:20.710
Every family has its own mess.

00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.590
Mr. Pei's mess is on another level.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.430
Still feels a bit far-fetched to me.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:26.620
Putting that aside,

00:15:26.860 --> 00:15:27.710
the real question is,

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:29.430
what do we do next?

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:36.710
Family feud or not,

00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:39.020
is anyone planning to leave Tengda?

00:15:40.124 --> 00:15:41.813
Even if there
has to be a job reassignment,

00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:43.813
would it be fine
to be tormented by the two Simas?

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.830
Then we stay,

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.590
and help Mr. Pei win this fight.

00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:48.990
- Let's do it.
- Let's do it.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:54.380
Hello, this is nameless private kitchen.

00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.990
What would you like to order?

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.740
Miss,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.620
do I look like I'm here to eat?

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.590
If you're not here to eat...

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.860
Zhen,

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.860
you still think this is the restaurant?

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.500
We're programmers now.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.900
Programmers?

00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:09.190
Wake up already.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:10.380
Move.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.710
Are you new here?

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:14.500
A pair of two!

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:18.430
We were transferred over

00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.620
from the private kitchen,

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.946
to work on the new version
of the Divine Mountains and Seas.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:24.230
Do you want?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.740
Don't drag me into this.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.020

Mr. Sima is not at this address.

00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:04.150
Try another one.

00:17:04.768 --> 00:17:06.470
I haven't been able to reach him either.

at Tengda holding up?)

Today,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.710
I want to share a song with everyone.

Delivery here.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.710
How long has this been?

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.020
Three hours and it still hasn't arrived.

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.580
This isn't just being late anymore.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:05.580
I'm filing a complaint.

00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:06.470
No, Mr. Qiao,

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:07.340
it's me.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:08.390
Knowing me won't help.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:09.430
I'm still complaining.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.190
It's me, Bao Xu.

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:13.190
Bao what?

00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:17.820
Mr. Bao?

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:18.950
You...

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.190
Why are you delivering food?

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:21.580
Quick.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:22.710
Please, come in.

00:18:23.950 --> 00:18:25.340

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:26.190
Thanks.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:27.190
What happened?

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:28.990
Two Sima executives showed up.

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:30.150
They're trying to split us up,

00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.580
then push cross rotation,

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.950
to throw us off balance

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.190
and control us more easily.

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:35.910
So you ended up

00:18:36.724 --> 00:18:38.249
working at the grassroots level?

00:18:38.250 --> 00:18:39.820
I didn't even know
how to ride an e-bike.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.791
I learned on the spot.

00:18:40.835 --> 00:18:42.260
Then I saw it was your address.

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:42.950
I got excited,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.100
and fell.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:45.580
Mr. Qiao,

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.870
enjoy your meal.

Please leave a good review.

My next order's almost late.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:50.580
I have to go.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.302
Mr. Qiao, please give me a good review.

00:18:52.346 --> 00:18:54.100
Or they'll extend my rotation.

00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:58.230
How did it come to this?

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:02.950

Welcome to Tengda Games.

Ms. Xin.

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:28.820
You look a bit worn out.

Don't speak like

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.390

Xin.

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:34.390
As for you,

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.470
I didn't expect you to cooperate

00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:38.102
with the role rotation so smoothly.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.100
But when dealing with colleagues,

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.190
be more sincere.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.950
Don't be so stiff.

He's not there.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:11.500
One of the houses was covered in mold.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.540
It was full of creeping plants.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:15.613
He's slippery as a rabbit.
Where did he go?

00:20:15.635 --> 00:20:17.150
What is he even trying to do?

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.340
Come on, Mr. Pei.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:23.150
Please.

I'm going to the restroom.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:10.670

00:21:15.591 --> 00:21:16.500
Look at this title page.

What did you even write?

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.480
This writing style of yours
feels like a nature documentary.

00:21:20.546 --> 00:21:22.950
First, you're watching a lion,
then it's zebras migrating.

There's no logical connection,

Can you even do this?

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:29.950
If not, replace them.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.670
Sure. We can replace them.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:33.060
We can switch right away, Mr. Lu!

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.100
I must speak

No matter where he is,

00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:49.630
he has to give me the money.

Excuse me. Make way.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.670
Please step aside.

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.430

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:23.300
seeing things?

looked so much like Mr. Sima.

You're not seeing things.

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.580
That was Mr. Sima.

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.340
I knew Mr. Sima

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.740
had never been in good health.

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:48.100
So that's it.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.813
He's been recovering in China all along,

00:27:49.857 --> 00:27:50.670
not overseas.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.820

that he was ill.

00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:57.500
If he needed treatment, fine,

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:00.300
but why insist he was abroad?

00:28:01.035 --> 00:28:02.540
I searched the whole world for him.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:03.870
No wonder I couldn't find him.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:12.540
This report says

00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:14.430
he's just undergone a major surgery.

00:28:14.910 --> 00:28:16.300
He's currently in a coma.

00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:23.430
If...

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:26.430
I mean, if...

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.020
he stays unconscious

00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.470
and never wakes up, what then?

00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.260
If...

00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.780
something truly happens to him,

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:41.990
that would be a force majeure.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:46.500
The agreement between you
would become void.

00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:49.230
All the terms he promised you

00:28:49.990 --> 00:28:51.100
would no longer apply.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:54.670
The agreement would be void...

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:01.820
Doctor,

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.230
I'm begging you, please save him.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.190
I understand
how the patient and family feel,

00:29:06.910 --> 00:29:08.060
but you're injured as well.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:10.260
Please try to keep
your emotions in check.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.780
I can't control myself.

00:29:12.791 --> 00:29:13.500
I'm begging you.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.340
Please save him.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:16.740
Treat Sima as a last hope.

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:17.910
Don't panic. Don't panic.

00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:20.020
Please calm down. Try to calm yourself.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.540
Alright.

00:29:26.670 --> 00:29:27.580
Deep breaths.

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.060
Such a devoted son.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.020
Truly devoted.

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.740
Mr. Pei!

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:43.420
(Shenhua International)

00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.580
How is it?

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:57.820
How is Mr. Pei doing?

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.190
Everyone, please be at ease.

00:30:00.368 --> 00:30:01.813
I just returned from the hospital.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.500
Mr. Pei is stable for now.

00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:04.990
He only needs time to recover.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:06.500
But he specifically asked me

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:07.780
to tell you not to visit him.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:09.500
He needs proper rest.

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:10.580
No, what about me?

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.500
Especially you.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:13.060
Please don't go.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.950
Those Simas are unbelievable.

00:30:21.102 --> 00:30:22.670
Putting us through this is one thing,

00:30:22.670 --> 00:30:23.829
but Mr. Pei suffered the most.

00:30:23.830 --> 00:30:26.050
The moment he learned
that Sima Tu and Sima Sui had fled,

00:30:26.057 --> 00:30:27.257
he went after them immediately.

00:30:27.324 --> 00:30:28.990
An electric scooter vs. a sports car.
So brave!

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:30.430
Thankfully, he's young.

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:32.230
Mr. Pei is truly impressive.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.500
A small build with remarkable drive.

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.870
No. I'm going to the hospital.

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.359
- I need to look after him.
- Ma Yang.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.968
Ms. Xin already made it clear.
Mr. Pei doesn't want to be disturbed.

00:30:40.968 --> 00:30:42.740
He needs some quiet time.

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.260
What we should do now

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:45.710
is think about how to help Tengda.

00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:47.910
That's the most practical support.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:48.580
Exactly.

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:50.230
Mr. Ma, Lin Wan is right.

00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:51.580
Let's listen to Ms. Lin.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.430
Tengda is in chaos right now.

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.340
Mr. Pei must be deeply concerned.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.020
We need to focus on

00:30:57.020 --> 00:30:58.390
how to turn this situation around.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.340
My suggestion is

00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.099
to halt the cross-rotation immediately,

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:05.449
and return everyone to their posts.

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:06.657
Get operations back on track.

00:31:06.657 --> 00:31:08.020
Then Mr. Pei can rest assured.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.670
Alright.

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:11.230
Let's work together.

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.950
When Mr. Pei returns,
he'll see a Tengda back in profit.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:14.830
Do we have confidence?

00:31:14.830 --> 00:31:15.430
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:16.540
We will help Mr. Pei

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.020
win this family conflict.

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:18.340
Good.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:19.230
- Alright.
- Okay!

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:20.740
We need to make them see

00:31:20.740 --> 00:31:22.100
that Mr. Pei, the fifth son,

00:31:22.100 --> 00:31:23.300
is absolutely not incompetent.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.020
Let's go.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:24.670
Come on!

00:31:24.670 --> 00:31:25.230
Move out!

00:31:25.230 --> 00:31:25.950
Get to work.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.620
(Cleaning in progress)

00:31:41.910 --> 00:31:42.990
You're all back.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:44.740
We are.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:46.430
Yes, Ma'am.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:48.060
We've stopped the cross-rotation

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.591
and returned to our original roles.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:51.740
That's good.

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:53.390
Back to normal is good.

00:31:54.168 --> 00:31:56.280
How's the new version
of the Divine Mountains and Seas?

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:57.340
Did you catch up on schedule?

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.470
We're pushing at full speed.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:59.020
The new demo

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.100
is already in testing.

00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:01.670
Wei and I are also

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:02.780
working on reward claims

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:04.630
and experience optimization.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:05.390
Good.

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:06.780
That cross-rotation idea

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:08.300
really slowed everything down.

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.170
Or the new version
would have launched earlier.

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:11.150
Exactly.

00:32:11.540 --> 00:32:12.100
Yes.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.990
Those two Simas didn't help at all.

00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:15.480
They only created internal friction.

00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:16.230
That said,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:17.190
Chef Lin

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.100
did come up with a few solid ideas

00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:21.580
while he was with our department.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.057
I'll send them to you for reference.

00:32:23.057 --> 00:32:23.630
Sounds great.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:24.340
Perfect.

00:32:36.390 --> 00:32:37.670
These are all new dishes.

00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.820
Why haven't I seen them before?

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.950
During those months
I worked at Tengda Games,

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.540
I couldn't really do much there.

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:46.150
With time on my hands,

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.580
I started developing new dishes.

00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.910
Over time,

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:50.230
the recipes I created

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:52.630
are enough to fully refresh

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:53.991
the private kitchen's entire menu.

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:55.100
Impressive.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:58.780
Alright.

00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.340
Cut.

00:33:00.102 --> 00:33:01.100
The meaning is spot on.

00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:03.413
- It all clicked. I mean it.
- Good. Get ready for the next scene.

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.390
Let me take a look.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:05.470
For the next scene, can we

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.060
make a small adjustment?

00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:07.820
Director.

00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.100
Mr. Lu, come on.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.150
Sit.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.870
How was it?

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:13.500
Not a single problem.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:14.910
I can't nitpick anything.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:17.020
It was excellent.
The meaning was completely right.

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:18.280
And that turn you did just now,

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.991
I didn't expect you
to handle it like that.

00:33:19.991 --> 00:33:20.991
Very sophisticated.

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:23.870
Mr. Lu acted really well.

00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.020
The real screenwriter is back.

00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.060
No.

00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.990
Mr. Lu,

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:32.020
I'm truly sorry.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:33.390
Earlier, our Mr. Ma

00:33:33.390 --> 00:33:34.470
changed a few things.

00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.950
Don't worry.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:35.740
I'll send you

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:37.300
the updated title page soon.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:38.870
As for any bugs,

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:39.946
we've already patched them.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:40.580
Bugs?

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:42.430
There are no bugs.

00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:44.580
Honestly, your Mr. Ma

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:46.820
has a real gift.

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:49.910
Use his version.
I already told the director.

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:50.880
No need to change a thing.

00:33:52.230 --> 00:33:53.740
So it turns out Yuanbao AI

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.300
is the one
who truly understands Lu Zhiyao.

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:58.230
Everyone,

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.100
should we destroy unverified products?

00:34:00.124 --> 00:34:01.340
(Ponytail Live)
Destroy them!

00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:03.190
Should we do it right now?

00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:04.580
- Right now!
- Right now!

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.500
Right now!

00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.390
Everyone,

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.750
this is today's

00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:10.700
last unverified product.

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:11.990
Same time tomorrow,

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:13.830
stay tuned to Ponytail Live.

00:34:13.830 --> 00:34:15.100
See you then.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:17.140
Everyone, we're ending the stream!

00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.660
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:20.060
Is it off?

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.140
Stream's over. It's off.

00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:22.350
I'm exhausted.

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:23.100
Good work.

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:23.660
It's fine.

00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:24.310
Nice work.

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.500
Mr. Ma.

00:34:26.768 --> 00:34:27.790
I'm already off stream.

00:34:27.835 --> 00:34:29.540
If it's another product,
talk to me tomorrow.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:30.220
No, it's not that.

00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.390
Ms. Hao Qiong said

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:33.580
Ponytail Live is making a profit now!

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:34.700
Really?

00:34:34.700 --> 00:34:35.430
Yes!

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.620
If this keeps up,

00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:40.700
before Mr. Pei finishes recuperating
and comes back,

00:34:40.702 --> 00:34:42.013
we'll be able to clean up the mess

00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.310
those Simas caused.

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:44.060
