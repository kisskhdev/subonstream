The world is healing,
don't you think?

Sir Michael and
Sir Frederico are talking again.

00:34:14.233 --> 00:34:15.833
Right?

00:34:15.833 --> 00:34:18.800
After a decade of them
being on bad terms,

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.800
What changed?
What happened?

00:34:21.267 --> 00:34:24.267
You know,
let's stop overthinking.

00:34:24.267 --> 00:34:27.267
Let's think of the menu
we'll have for Easter Sunday.

00:34:27.267 --> 00:34:30.067
Because, like before,
the Almazans will be here.

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.967
- They're coming? Wait.
- Yes.

00:34:31.967 --> 00:34:33.900
- Where is it?
- What are you looking for?

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.067
Oh, here it is.

00:34:35.433 --> 00:34:38.033
I need to bring out
the big cauldron.

Cauldron? You're doing
too much.

Oh, come on.

I'm just excited, Monnette.

[MONETTE] You're so silly.

00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:55.467
Isn't this too sudden?

00:34:58.233 --> 00:34:59.267
What is?

Michael and I are reconciling?

If that's true...

then no.

Why are you wearing a mask
